http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/the-original-crab-shanty-tables-for-two	The Original Crab Shanty	361 City Island Ave., the Bronx 	40.8486462	-73.7871834	718-885-1810	2016/06/27	<p data-wc="127" word_count="127">Antoine’s, in the French Quarter of New Orleans, lays claim to the invention, in 1889, of oysters Rockefeller. On any given day, a waiter there might tell a visitor to the Big Easy that the shells are filled with an herby green sauce “because green’s the color of money.” The oysters Rockefeller at the Original Crab Shanty, in City Island, however, are bigger, better, and golden, because that’s the color of melted cheese. There are few green things on the menu here, apart from, recently, the City Island Iced Tea, which a server described as “very similar to a Long Island Iced Tea” (typically a brown drink), and which arrived as emerald as the lantern on Daisy’s dock. Other times, it’s been blue.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Colors are also key when ordering appetizers: “red or white soup,” the server might offer. Go with the white—it’s velveteen with clams—or, better yet, begin with a juicy pile of fried calamari. The fare in this shanty doesn’t follow today’s trends, which insist that the ocean’s bounty should be light, salubrious, and, hopefully, mercury free. The stewards of this corner of the Bronx look back to when a seafood dinner had to be hearty enough to sate a skiff-full of ravenous crab fisherman emerging from the roiling North Atlantic.</p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">Crustaceans reign, particularly those of the infraorder Brachyura. The Craby Clams, in spite of being misspelled, are a must. They’re stuffed with crab meat and bread crumbs, and put any mere crabcake to shame. Combo deals, named “A Banquet for Crab Lovers” and “Italian Feast,” are recommended for a group. Before you dive into the heaps of chitinous exoskeletons, which arrive with a casual “bon appétit, guys,” you’ll want to don the plastic bib provided, to mitigate the inevitable spatter of red sauce and lobster juice. If you’ve ordered the Banquet, be prepared to crack your way through a forest of soft-shell crabs and thickets of snow-crab legs; the Feast features crustaceans bathed in a superlative marinara sauce, served over a bed of disappointingly rubbery pasta.</p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">The shanty bustles on any night of the week, and the bar at the front makes sure the tempo is maintained until late. As butter and claws fly around the table with increasing alacrity, you might just end up like the misty-eyed man in an Adidas tracksuit who, late on a Tuesday evening, considering a pile of empty shells and a table of sated friends, clapped the waiter on the back and declared, “Sal, this is all on me.” <em>(Dishes $7.99-$59.99; combo platters $71.99-$79.99.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/20/bar-omar-tables-for-two	Bar Omar	188 Grand St., Brooklyn 	40.7140811	-73.9608355307956	718-388-0411	2016/06/20	<p data-wc="79" word_count="79">In Paris, especially on beautiful summer nights, Chez Omar still has a line out the door, almost forty years after it opened. The French-Algerian restaurant has a full bistro menu, but few people bother with it, because everyone comes for the same thing: dunes of couscous served with vegetable stew and expertly charred meat. Four months ago, Yasmina Guerda, the daughter of Omar himself, opened the first extension of her father’s restaurant, promising Brooklyn the same dreamy offerings.</p><p data-wc="58" word_count="58">The Williamsburg space is cavernous, more reminiscent of a saloon than a French brasserie, with lazily spinning ceiling fans and sanded white wood. But Yasmina, who runs to the restaurant after her day job at the U.N., has in many ways stayed true to the Paris original: paper table covers, bistro chairs, and her great-grandmother’s recipes.</p><p data-wc="203" word_count="203">An ideal meal starts with the <em>bastilla</em>, pulled chicken and almonds jammed into <em>brik</em> dough and fried until crispy, like a giant square spring roll. It’s topped with a thick layer of confectioner’s sugar, a touch that works so well you may recklessly wonder why more appetizers aren’t frosted. For the main dishes, the bistro basics, especially the steak au poivre, are dependably good, and the couscous is filling. But the tagine (lamb, chicken, or kefta) is the showstopper. Portioned for two, it arrives in a tall clay vessel, clutched between napkins. The waiter pauses for dramatic effect before rolling off the lid, letting steam billow out. If you ordered the lamb, swollen prunes, fat apricots, and egg-shaped potatoes hug two giant shanks sunk in a still-bubbling broth; the prunes collapse into a sweet, jammy mess the second they’re touched. Shovel some of the fruit over meat pulled clean from the bone, add slivered almonds for crunch, and it’s a perfect bite. Ending your meal with dessert is a must, and the crème brûlée is irreproachably classic. Shatter the shell of blistered sugar into pieces that look like stained glass and try not to smile.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">On busy nights, the restaurant is full of homesick internationals. “This <em>méchoui</em> is more Lebanese than Algerian,” one says, examining his rack of lamb. But, on some evenings, before the dinner rush hits, at a very European 9 <small>P.M.</small>, you may find yourself the only patron. While half of the waitstaff dotes on you, the other half might be crowdsourcing the day’s crossword puzzle. “Fifty Across, Cole Porter classic from ‘Can-Can,’ ” a bartender calls out. “I LOVE PA_I_.” Bar Omar does a brilliant job of filling in those blanks. <em>(Dishes $7-$28; tagine for two $36-$39.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/06/kang-ho-dong-baekjeong-tables-for-two	Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong	1 E. 32nd St. 	39.814437	-86.1204269	212-966-9839	2016/06/06	<p data-wc="100" word_count="100">Standing in the frequently interminable line outside this riotous barbecue joint, a listless patron might find herself staring at the gargantuan face, sketched in caricature, of a man perilously clinging to the Empire State Building, one hand raised with a thumbs-up, mouth agape in speech, most likely in the act of hawking beef. Kang Ho Dong, the wrestler turned comedian turned restaurateur, whom the cartoon depicts, is an ubiquitous TV presence in Korea, but in the U.S., where his image presides over outposts in Hawaii, L.A., and Queens, his name is synonymous with slabs of marbled, melting meat.</p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">Korean barbecue has never been for the faint of stomach, but, consumed to the beat of “Gangnam Style,” amidst baseball-capped servers speed-walking in matching tees, it becomes a marathon for which untrained appetites may be at a distinct disadvantage. One might, for example, overdose on the palate-cleansing <em>banchan</em> (gratis side dishes consisting of lime-and-beet-juice-pickled daikon, honey-sweetened potato wedges, and silken tofu steeped in soy and chili), wholly ignorant of the appetizers to follow. These could include a hearty seafood pancake (a smidge too spongy for Paleo dieters, one suspects) and a beef tartare tossed with cubes of ripe Asian pear and generously drizzled with sesame oil (an unexpectedly refreshing pairing). The main event—there are only two options, grilled pork or beef—requires a hanging tubular smoke vacuum that evokes the tentacular appendage of a formidable space machine. Underneath it, in the center of the table, is the grill, ringed by a bright-yellow moat, half corn and mozzarella, half whisked egg batter, which will bubble into a creamy soufflé alongside the meat.</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">One recent evening, three friends first chose the beef combo, which includes brisket, seasoned short rib, and prime rib eye, and, for good measure, an added order of beef tongue. The joy of Korean barbecue lies in part in its performance: watching ruby-red curls of brisket caramelize while translucent slices of Pringle-shaped tongue sizzle, crisp-edged and glinting. Facing the multiplying mosaic of bowls and plates, one friend moaned, “The increasing quantity of food seems to necessitate greater speed of consumption, as if all the plates will disappear the second I stop eating!” They did not; the pork combo (inch-thick slabs of pork belly, jowl, and collar) arrived. The richer meat paired well with the yuzu<em>-soju </em>cocktail, which tasted like grapefruit marinated in spiked lemonade. “I think the alcohol helps me get a second wind,” her companion said hopefully. In a marathon, it’s important to stay hydrated. <em>(Barbecue $24.99-$104.99.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

This is actually happening, in part thanks to the London-based Urbanspace, which has a rather corporate-sounding name for a company that, for the past eight years, has been championing high-quality small local food businesses, many based in Brooklyn, with pop-up markets from Union Square to Columbus Circle. Its latest venture, just north of Grand Central Terminal, drastically improves the state of lunchtime ennui for the midtown masses.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Anticipation for impending debauchery builds as you take a lap and weigh your options. From twenty-one venders, one could choose: chicken cheesesteaks (at Mayhem &amp; Stout), non-G.M.O. gyros (at Amali Mou), or a tin of Spanish mackerel with a glass of rosé (at Maiden Lane). There are truffle-cheddar pretzels at Sigmund’s, which serves German beer in proper glasses at a handsome marble bar. There’s shawarma at Mimi’s Hummus or, at Kuro-Obi, an offshoot of Ippudo, <em>tako yaki</em> (deep-fried octopus balls) and ambrosial bowls of ramen, without the hour-plus wait.</p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">The downsides are worrisome: crowds cramming into not quite enough benches; mountains of to-go packaging; deafening acoustics, especially weekdays after work, when beer and Roberta’s Bee Sting pizzas win the day. But there are also hibiscus doughnuts at Dough. And Red Hook Lobster Pound, which has a way with fishing net and anchors, manages to evoke a New England galley kitchen, making Oyster Happy Hour and a dozen Old Bay-dusted peel-and-eat shrimp seem like a very good idea.</p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">Or just head straight for Delaney Chicken. Inspired by the New Orleans institution Willie Mae’s, Daniel Delaney has taken a detour from Texas barbecue (at BrisketTown, in Williamsburg), to focus on the fried-chicken sandwich. After six hours in a brine, dark meat is dipped into a buttermilk-cayenne batter foaming with baking soda and fried à la minute. The chicken ends up super juicy and crispy, with a whisper of heat, perfect on a soft bun with mayonnaise, hot sauce, and pickles.</p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">Or maybe you’d like a burger. Andrew Zurica, of Hard Times Sundaes, attracted notice for his impeccable fast-food-style gems slung in a truck stationed in the Kings Plaza parking lot. It’s fun to watch the line cook chuck a ball of meat onto the grill and pound it with a handled weight, pressing it down to form perfectly salty-crispy bits all around the edges of the patty. Covered with American cheese, popped onto a Martin’s potato bun, it’s even more fun to eat. Follow it up with buttermilk-honey-blueberry ice cream from OddFellows, and you’re good to go. <em>(Pretty much everything is under $20.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/23/hangawi-tables-for-two	Hangawi	12 E. 32nd St. 	29.815568	-95.3946569	212-213-0077	2016/05/23	<p data-wc="98" word_count="98">In Korean, <em>um</em> and <em>yang</em> correspond to the Chinese concepts of yin and yang. The philosophy at the K-town vegan restaurant Hangawi is simple: the ideal diet consists of a harmonious coupling of um foods, such as greens and fruit, with their yang brethren, a category that includes mainly root vegetables. As the restaurant’s Web site states, “An imbalance will cause bad health.” Luckily, the menu contains plenty of both um and yang veggies, cooked in innovative and delicious ways, and diners—even the meat lovers among us—can leave Hangawi feeling not only full but satisfied.</p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">Shoes are left at the entrance, stowed in a rack next to brightly colored traditional Korean hwa boots. These, one assumes, are decoration; they almost certainly don’t belong to the clientele, which is roughly divided between Europeans kitted out with Macy’s bags and the dilapidated look of people who have just spent their first day in midtown, and New Yorkers with the bedraggled look of people who have long lived in the neighborhood. But the dialectic between these two classes of patrons is soon transcended by the singular peace that accompanies creaking across a wooden floor in one’s socks, slotting into ground-level seating, and enjoying a nip of nongju, a creamy rice liquor, ladled from a giant ceramic bowl.</p><p data-wc="59" word_count="59">Incomplete is the dinner at Hangawi that ignores appetizers, even though the restaurant provides kimchi gratis. From the gluten-free section of the menu come little papery dumplings, slathered in spinach sauce, that explode with kale when bitten into. Sesame-leaf tofu patties come decorated with an orchid and taste a little like shrimp toast, but feel a great deal lighter.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">After all that um, the main course provides a healthy serving of yang: rice is paired with todok, a root that can also be used as an aphrodisiac. The servers mix them together in a scalding stone bowl, sagely informing diners that they “can eat it with the chopstick, but it’s better with the spoon,” and then ritually clattering the side of the bowl with a spoon, as if to reinforce their point. Recently, a vegan take on Mongolian hot pot, upon whose rim was perched a skewer of date, walnut, maitaki mushroom, and tofu, pullulated with sweet-potato noodles, and was just the right amount of spicy.</p><p data-wc="73" word_count="73">Finish up dinner with silken tofu chocolate pudding and perhaps a splash of tea from Mt. Jiri. The latter should be steeped in nearly boiling water for forty seconds before drinking; if any of the former is left forty seconds after arriving, it’ll be a small miracle. Another miracle: as you approach the door, your shoes appear as if by magic, just in time for the plunge back into midtown. (Dishes $19-$30.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/16/el-atoradero-tables-for-two	El Atoradero	708 Washington Ave., Brooklyn 	40.6768649	-73.9638170784625	718-399-8226	2016/05/16	<p data-wc="104" word_count="104">As the chef Denisse Lina Chavez pushes out of the kitchen of her new Mexican restaurant, in Prospect Heights, people on bar stools tower over her. She’s tiny, but as electric as her hot-pink bandana: Chavez has famously gone on spice pilgrimages through drug-cartel-controlled stretches of the Mexican desert to collect chilis and anise-flavored avocado leaves for her Poblano cuisine. She surveys the room. Micheladas slosh to cheers of “Mexicans in a Mexican restaurant!”; a couple whispers, “<em>Huevo</em>, that’s Spanish for egg.” Chavez is a long way from the South Bronx bodega where her reign as the Queen of Carnitas began, in 2002.</p><p data-wc="72" word_count="72">The stringy carnitas available elsewhere in New York had nothing on Chavez’s bodega offerings, corn tortillas stuffed with juicy cubes of pork and melting strips of fat. Demand was so great that she opened a restaurant next door. The craze continued. When her landlord made noise about raising the rent, she shuttered the restaurant (the bodega’s still there, but carnitas production ceased last month) and moved the operation to Brooklyn.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">The new place bumps with hip-hop and Mexican pop; a bar TV plays Yankees games on mute; hand-painted pineapples on the walls brighten the candle-lit room. The portions are enormous, and the price just right, inspiring diners with even the most abstemious of intentions to indulge in an artery-corking feast. But, four months after the restaurant’s opening, the food is inconsistent. The <em>albondigas enchipotladas</em>—pork meatballs drenched in chipotle sauce—are dry and dull one meal, transcendent the next. The <em>mixiotes</em>, masterfully undersold by the bartender one night as “a mixture of dark chicken in a bag,” is a standout. The meat—drowned in orange juice, covered in those hard-earned avocado leaves, and steam-braised in a plastic baggy—is impossible to stop eating. Meanwhile, the squash-blossom quesadilla languishes, stuffed with a sad vegetable hash. Most sacrilegious of all, those famous carnitas are disappointing, with grizzled bits of fat and cartilage.</p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">Chavez knows that things aren’t up to snuff. The spit-fired <em>al pastor</em> basting in fresh pineapple juice one evening is gone a week later. “Chef wasn’t happy with it,” the bartender says. Chavez’s daughter Diana, behind the counter of the Bronx bodega, attests that compromise does not exist for her mother. Abducted by Los Zetas in 2013, the fearless chef returned to Mexico in February for more spices. There’s a great chance that, by the time the back patio opens and the liquor license finally comes through, Chavez will have things whipped into shape. As her daughter says, she will stop at nothing short of perfection. <em>(Dishes $3.50-$20.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/brooklyns-best-frozen-margaritas-tables-for-two	Santa Fe Grill	62 Seventh Ave., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2016/05/09	<p data-wc="119" word_count="119">On a stormy Monday night, three twenty-somethings headed west from their trendy stomping ground of Prospect Heights to sleepy Park Slope and its Santa Fe Grill, which the <em>Times</em>, in 1989, named “one of the hot nightspots among the young and restless.” Ducking in from Seventh Avenue, they found the Dixie Chicks playing on loop, and the long cherrywood bar populated by baby boomers who know where to find a generous serving of Southwestern kitsch, plus food that an <em>abuelita</em> would make if she read back issues of <em>Gourmet:</em> crispy Oaxacan chicken basted in honey-lime butter; charred skirt steak marinated in basil and chili paste; shrimp enchiladas made with delicate blue-corn tortillas, a smoky tomatillo sauce, and fresh Chihuahuan cheese.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">Some restaurants are comfortable, some are delectable, and a small number, like Santa Fe, strike a genial balance between the two. For thirty years, the excesses of the space—part sweat lodge, part hunting lodge, with tribal vestments and cow skulls fastened to the stucco walls—have been mellowed by the light of non-electrified candles, deep padded booths, and windowed doors that open onto the sidewalk. Also mellowing: the borough’s best frozen margaritas. They are prepared with a secret sour-lemon mix and dispensed from an ancient frozen-yogurt machine; plastic animals sit astride the salted rims of the oversized glasses. The tangy cilantro-strewn salsa is house-made, as are the tricolored chips, and both are endlessly refilled by the easygoing wait staff. In caloric compensation, the vegetable quesadilla is light on cheese and stuffed with asparagus, firm and thinly sliced, and corn kernels roasted nearly to bursting.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">A few menu items should be avoided. The chimichanga, a super-dense fried burrito, might be mistaken, in the consistency of its contents, for one huge bean; recently, pollock in the fish tacos was so finely shredded that it approached a paste. Go instead for the chicken-mole enchiladas, which are unassailable—the meat tender but textured, the sauce rich but unfussy, conferring a shock of sweetness on the tongue and a slow burn on the roof of the mouth. To cool off, try a slice of coconut cream cake, imported from Cousin John’s Café and Bakery, a thirty-year veteran of the same block. The flaked coconut is fresh and abundant, pressed into a wonderfully mysterious coating: whipped cream or icing? Another balance, struck. <em>(Entrées $14-$21.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Capable of clearing the most insidious of blocked sinuses, food cooked with <em>mala</em> can also bring stoics to tears. Such is the enduring power of <em>mala</em> that it has, of late, been transubstantiated from its renowned liquid form—hot pot, a bubbly soup—to its newer, hipper cousin, the dry pot.</p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">Legend has it that dry pot—a sauceless medley of anything small enough to be tossed in a wok, birthed in Chongqing, the sprawling metropolis at the heart of Sichuan—hit the big time only after a few Beijing chefs, on vacation in Sichuan, imported the method north in the early aughts. From there, it has snuck onto the menus of Chinatown hideaways, frequently mischaracterized as casserole. MáLà Project is the spirited East Village creation of a twenty-three-year-old Hebei native, who, in her refusal to “cook down” to First Avenue hipsters, gives the dish the star treatment it deserves.</p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">From a menu of sixty or so meats and vegetables, you choose ingredients (three to six are suggested per person) and, more important, the preferred level of spiciness. (Of the four levels, the lowest is non-spicy, and the highest, super-spicy, might require a fire extinguisher.) Traditional Chinese favorites like beef tendon, tongue, intestine, and artery (a must-try for the uninitiated) merrily jostle with more conventional choices, like <em>wakame</em>, tofu skin, lotus root, and king oyster mushrooms. When an adventurous first-timer pointed to the unfamiliar item rooster’s XXX, the handsome Uighur waiter deadpanned, “Chicken testicles, ma’am. One order?”</p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">Dry pots arrive in huge bamboo bowls, slick with oil, bathed in sesame seeds, and heaped with cilantro. Cumin, ginger, cardamom, licorice, and twenty other spices are tossed in, but all you’ll feel is that signature mouth-tingling that renders self-control futile and makes consumption an exercise in stamina. To cool the tongue, you might land on the Xiangxi Fried Rice, an innocuous-seeming staple that packs an incendiary punch, with Chinese bacon and bird’s-eye chilies. Better to go for “candy garlic,” a grain-liquor chaser that doubles as a temporary palate emollient. One evening, two Sichuanese and a Beijing native took a break from their medium-spicy meal to reminisce about their first dry pot in China. “It can definitely develop into an addiction,” one said. “Once, it was all I consumed for a week.” The three friends looked at each other and the pot. Then they dug back in. <em>(Dishes $6-$16; ingredients $3-$8.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

The result is gaudy, outlandish, and utterly fun, a little like Sofrito, the Puerto Rican restaurant that sits next to it. A recent transplant from Midtown East, where it drew the likes of Jennifer Lopez and Jamie Foxx, Sofrito remains a carnival of purple light and salsa music.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">“Tips are like hugs without all the touching,” a sign reads at the entrance, where affable hostesses beckon you in, past floor-to-ceiling windows through which twinkle the lights of the George Washington Bridge. Even if the décor reminds you of all the clubs that didn’t let you in as a teen, everything about Sofrito is studiously friendly—starting with a text message reminding you of your reservation. By the time you sit down, you’ve completely forgotten that you are dining atop a sewage plant.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">All this pizzazz might bode badly for the food, but dense, buttery bread, which arrives in time for you to peruse the menu, is a sign of good things to come. The cocktail list is implied rather than codified (“We got everything,” a waitress recently explained). Mojitos, which come in Mason jars, are a little too sweet. Their saccharine aftertaste is best countered with <em>alcapurrias</em>, taro roots stuffed with beef picadillo, accompanied by a mayonnaise-and-ketchup dip that, according to a Midwestern patron, “tastes like a really old establishment deli smells.”</p><p data-wc="94" word_count="94">For a lighter touch, try the cod <em>tostones montaditos</em>, slices of fish with a garlicky zing which rest atop fried plantains. This starchy theme continues into the main course, with a superb <em>mofongo al pilón</em>. The green plantain mash can be topped with chicken, beef, shrimp, lobster, or pork stew, and is more than enough for two. While <em>mofongo</em> is classic Puerto Rican fare, sushi is not. Surprisingly, then, from the Latin Asian Corner of the menu comes the Sofrito Roll, a delicious combination of rice, tempura shrimp, and—you guessed it—plantains.</p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">Though dessert at Sofrito is not a focal point (no plantains, you see), a recent vanilla flan came delightfully topped with lip-shaped sprinkles. The best bet after you’ve finished eating is to head straight to the bar, where patrons in a dizzying array of shiny and stretchy fabrics dance to salsa, merengue, and Enrique Iglesias. There, you’ll learn that one of the bartenders spends only half of the year in New York. The other half she spends in Ibiza. <em>(Entrées $17-$39.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

After one taste of the line-caught ocean perch, you heartily concur. The Maine-procured uni, gobbed over <em>mazemen</em> (a brothless ramen), strengthens the message that the seafood on the East Coast is as good as that in Japan, as long as you know how to handle it. The wild-tuna sashimi—a glistening, garnet dinner special, served alongside fermented yuzu zest spiked with chili pepper—is the ultimate revelation. You atone: I won’t eat farmed fish anymore!</p><p data-wc="200" word_count="200">Everything about the place embodies the Japanese concept of <em>mottainai</em>, let nothing go to waste. The dining room, in shades of wood, soil, and water, is minimal without being austere. Dried fish skins decorate the walls; bones from the morning’s fish go straight into the evening’s unctuous broth. But for a chef who values simplicity Haraguchi gives diners a lot of options. On weekday nights, the restaurant transforms into Yuji Ramen, a noodle joint, while weekend evenings feature a ten-course ramen tasting menu. The biggest draw, though, is the daily Japanese set breakfast. Miso soup and nutty, mauve rice accompany a plate of sides, as thoughtfully arranged as a painter’s palette: pickles, egg custard, and seasonal vegetables, like sweet potatoes tossed with sesame oil and mirin. It comes with a choice of fish, and you can’t go wrong—the salt-flecked mackerel is as perfect a bite as the kombu-cured roasted sea bass. But the real showstopper is the optional <em>onsen</em> egg, gently poached until the white and the yolk are the same molten texture. Served with more of that unforgettable sea urchin, it begs to be stirred into the rice. You leave nourished more than full.</p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">The restaurant’s small size has a price. Trying to predict the wait works about as well as guessing the G train’s schedule: 11 <small>A.M.</small> on an early-spring Sunday? Fifteen minutes. The same time on a Saturday a few weeks later? Almost two hours. A respite may be on the way: Haraguchi hopes to open a new place nearby—part fish market, part classroom, part sushi bar—this summer. But even the notoriously blunt butchers at the Meat Hook, where Haraguchi buys bones for his stock, know he’s worth the wait. As one of them attested, “He’s the only cook who comes in every day! What a damn good chef.” <em>(Set breakfast $27-$35; ramen $16-$24; ten-course tasting $120.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

He took to his own spin room—<em>Lucky Peach</em>, the quarterly food journal he co-founded—to give an interview along with the executive chef, Joshua Pinsky, about what Momofuku Nishi would and wouldn’t be. Chang insisted it was Pinsky’s restaurant, while admitting, “I worry about my stupid ego getting in there and fucking it up.” Over the next thousand or so words, he sounded off about the unfairly low price of most Asian food, “fusion” cuisine, and what it means to make Italian food with non-Italian ingredients; Pinsky spoke twice.</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">Everything about Nishi (Japanese for “west,” because it’s in Chelsea) is in lockstep with the rest of the Momofuku group: the dining room is loud, crowded, and hard to walk into past six o’clock in the evening. Chang claims that it’s what his first restaurant, Noodle Bar, would be if he had opened it at age thirty-eight rather than twenty-six. This is also another way of saying that it’s twelve years too late to complain about the empire’s now ubiquitous blond-wood backless benches and bar stools.</p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">The menu includes mostly appetizers and pastas (noodles by another name) and only two rotating entrées. Hybridized dishes are annotated with footnotes that explain their parentage: chicken and dumplings is Su Jae Bi x Malfatti x Cracker Barrel, or Korean noodle soup with Italian dumplings at a Southern chain restaurant. For Chang acolytes, the most satisfying part of dining at Nishi is tasting the results of his eternal hunt for sources of umami, an extension of his experiments with misos and sauces at his food laboratory. A starter of tofu with smoked trout roe and rye Bonji—a liquid seasoning similar to soy sauce—is like a savory, salty panna cotta. The earthy walnut bagna cauda arrives already smothering crisp stalks of Romaine lettuce, to create a nutty Caesar salad sprinkled with more walnuts, shaved. The coup de grâce is ceci e pepe, a twist on the simple classic, in which aged cheeses have been replaced with chickpea Hozon—a miso-style paste made from fermented legumes.</p><p data-wc="65" word_count="65">Prices are steep, but there is no tipping; the staff is paid a living wage. This is mature Chang, but also classic Chang: he doesn’t much care what we think as long as the food is tasty. But he would do well to let Pinsky, whose mother inspired Nishi’s most exquisite dessert, a pistachio Bundt cake, do more of the talking. <em>(Dishes $15-$36.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/04/the-cecil-tables-for-two	The Cecil	210 W. 118th St. 	41.6799323	-87.62797885	212-866-1262	2016/04/04	<p data-wc="143" word_count="143">In the late spring of 1960, 118th Street was abuzz after a lissome blonde, au naturel, stormed out of Room 308 of the Cecil Hotel and ran through the lobby, straight into the street. As the <em>Amsterdam News’s</em> Mr. 1-2-5, the columnist Les Matthews, recounted, a patrolman was knocked over in the ensuing kerfuffle. Some of that same ebullient spirit is celebrated at the restaurant that now bears the hotel’s name, in the form of a wire sculpture of nudes which crowns the bar by the entrance. The space seems built for natty young things waiting for their dates. If you’re one of them, try the Amina, which rolls out aromas of bourbon on a long tongue of chili-pepper-infused molasses, but know that you’ll have to settle up before going to your table, always an awkward start to a rendezvous.</p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104"> The Cecil Hotel closed after a fire in the nineteen-seventies. Three years ago, new owners opened a restaurant in the same location, giving it a spacious, contemporary-art-filled dining room. In the nineteen-forties, the Cecil was famous for housing the jazz club where bebop was invented; now it’s also known for Joseph (JJ) Johnson’s “Afro-Asian-American” cooking. (The fusion is his comment on the octopuslike reach of the slave trade.) While there’s still lots of jazz and blues on the restaurant’s sound system, you’re equally likely to hear a French rapper rhyming “Djibouti” with “agouti”—a type of South American rodent.</p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">A recent revision to Johnson’s menu saw the end of well-loved dishes such as his fried guinea hen. An excellent collard-green salad, which melds the softness of red adzuki beans with the crumble of candied cashews, thankfully remains. Along with braised goat dumplings, it is the best way to start a meal. The menu draws attention to drinks from Africa and the African diaspora. A Pinotage from South Africa (a type of red wine that is apparently very popular these days) pairs well with the superlative meat dishes, like the glazed oxtails, which rest on a mess of brown-rice grits, and the pan-roasted venison. One night, the half lobster was less impressive—the meat’s taste was lost in the heaviness of miso paste and udon noodles.</p><p data-wc="68" word_count="68">Among the desserts, the pairing of baobab mousse with olive-oil cake is king. A peanut-and-ice-cream confection is a lowly baron in comparison. The end of dinner here seems to stretch out, and on most Tuesdays musicians are on hand to soothe any distended bellies. Watching them play, with a forkful of that cake in hand, you might as well be somewhere between Harlem and Heaven. <em>(Entrées $18-$38.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/high-street-on-hudson-tables-for-two-west-village	High Street on Hudson	637 Hudson St. 	42.3561888	-83.0837728	917-388-3944	2016/03/28	<p data-wc="139" word_count="139">Tailored-denim napkins, butcher-block tableware, fermented, locavore, hearth-fired breads: down to the monochrome ceramics, this new West Village restaurant reads like a tableau in the cult life-style magazine <em>Kinfolk</em>. It all looks great, but is there enjoyment to be found in being perfect all the time? The chef, Eli Kulp, has said that the restaurant’s predecessor, Philadelphia’s acclaimed High Street on Market, was conceived around the baker Alex Bois’s whole-grain breads. Those unique and deeply flavorful loaves, such as the rich, dark anadama, fortified with molasses and cracked corn, have made the trip to New York, and serve as the hearty backbone of the restaurant’s many menus. Breakfast, lunch, dinner—High Street does it all, making it look so easy that you wonder why so many restaurants in the city are such slackers. (Dinner only? Lazy.)</p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">Breakfast is bracingly good, and not for the faint of heart. For the Bodega sandwich, soft scrambled eggs, aged Cheddar, and malted sausage are tucked into a burnished black-pepper-sage biscuit; a charred green chili pepper lies at its side, a literal sidekick. It’s an elegant and gluttonous feast for so early in the day—a recurring theme. The Meatpacker, a lovely compendium of meats, broccoli rabe, and eggs, comes with fried potatoes and aioli. One morning, the pretty pastries were impossible to avoid. They included a dainty yet potent doughnut filled with preserved-lemon cream and a luscious roasted-milk-chocolate cream puff with a whisper-light crumb, both just shy of savory.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">Things get a bit strange at dinner. One Saturday night, the tasting menu (a steal, at sixty-five dollars for at least nine dishes, served by kind enthusiasts) started with “crackers and cheese” (rye-sprouted crisps with vegan pistachio cheese), followed by a tiny appetizer involving dry-aged beet that packed the flavor of a bowl of borscht. Then came “cereal for dinner.” It was an alarming turn, as if someone had spiked a bowl of Kashi with quinoa and fried-chicken chicharrónes and added sour cashew milk as a warning: cerebral chef stuff happening here. But grilled tripe with charred cucumbers and watermelon radish was fantastically crispy, stealthily spicy, and riotously delicious. By the time the caramella arrived, with Tootsie Roll-shaped pasta that gave way to an oozing flow of shockingly sweet caramelized cauliflower, the cereal grift was forgiven.</p><p data-wc="44" word_count="44">Dessert veers back to the experimental, with flavors of burnt rye bread (in a crumble) and caraway (in ice cream). But there are also chocolate-covered bourbon-soaked raisins, and a cookie for the road—gratis parting gifts that are sweeter for the surprise. <em>(Dishes $8-$48.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/21/han-dynasty-tables-for-two	Han Dynasty	215 W. 85th St. 	41.7399294	-87.6293561	212-858-9060	2016/03/21	<p data-wc="91" word_count="91">When it comes to Chinese food, Upper West Siders have always been better off venturing uptown, toward Columbia, or downtown, toward everything else, at which point they might as well make the trip to Flushing. When word arrived that Han Dynasty, a popular Sichuan restaurant chain in Philadelphia, which opened a branch in the East Village in 2013, was coming to the neighborhood, hopes were high. Finally, a contender for “real” Chinese—spicy Sichuanese, rather than the blandly sweet Chinese-American takeout fare of places like Shun Lee and Ollie’s Noodle Shop.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">On West Eighty-fifth Street, between Broadway and Amsterdam, a cavernous dining room with heavily filigreed molding and a theatrically high ceiling awaits its discerning patrons. A row of banquettes borders large round tables with lazy Susans, set for parties of seven. But will they come? It’s hard to tell, because there are two barriers to Han Dynasty’s success uptown. First, its Web address, www.handynasty.net, can be a special problem for anyone trying to order delivery online (it has run into trouble with some porn filters). Second, it’s not clear that the Italian chain restaurant which previously occupied the space failed because of bad food—the vast dining room is genuinely hard to fill.</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">On a Friday night around eight, there was no wait for a table, but names were still taken. When a bespectacled Apatovian Everyman at the host station called out, “Mort, party of three?” he could have been delivering the line at an improv class. A group of two was seated next, and wasted no time ordering starters—it’s necessary to eat in stages, as plates multiply fast. Dumplings in chili oil were good if not life changing, and scallion pancakes were excellently flaky, like savory puff pastry. The sweet cold sesame noodles could have been skipped, given that dan-dan noodles are also available, and appetizers of Sichuan pickled vegetables and spicy, crispy cucumbers left much to be desired.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">Entrées are listed by style (double cooked, Kung Pao) and protein type (chicken, pork, beef, fish), in descending order of spiciness, from ten to zero. Don’t be fooled: salt-and-pepper-style shrimp (1)—essentially pre-seasoned crustacean popcorn—is not bland but bold, and the most frightening part of dry-pot-style fish (10) was the flame beneath the mini wok it arrived in. The flavors are faithfully Sichuan, if not assaultive, which made one former Queens resident wonder whether the scale doesn’t indicate more of an “Upper West Side ten.” To any locals who care to keep Han Dynasty around: show up in platoon strength and demand an eleven. <em>(Entrées $14.95-$28.95.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/abyssinia-in-harlem	Abyssinia	268 W. 135th St. 	41.428355	-81.7848889	212-281-2673	2016/03/14	<p data-wc="104" word_count="104">For lovers of Ethiopian food, recent years were marked by two seismic events in Harlem. First, Tsion Café and Bakery opened on Sugar Hill, serving steaming piles of stew atop injera. The latter is an iron-rich flatbread from the Horn of Africa, which has recently found favor with the young and the celiac, because teff—the love-grass grain that is the main ingredient in injera—doesn’t contain gluten. Tsion serves a version that is entirely gluten-free (some in the U.S. contain wheat or barley), as well as deliciously innovative takes on brunch classics, like scrambled eggs on a porous bed of injera.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">The needle on the seismometer trembled for a second time when Abyssinia, which has long been a 135th Street staple, underwent a renovation. What was once a shady den tinged a pallid green by the neon sign in the window blossomed into a bright dining hall spanning two storefronts. Some things stayed the same: the poster, in the back, of a woman pouring coffee next to dancing Amharic letters; the waitresses who smilingly explain that a meal is best shared and eaten by hand; and, of course, the exquisite food.</p><p data-wc="64" word_count="64"> To start, Abyssinia has two types of sambusa, or samosa, bursting with meat or lentils. But, though they’re perfect paired with a St. George beer (the main courses take a while to prepare), they’re only a prelude to the main event, the injera. Frehiwot Reta, the chef, ferments the bread for three days, and the result is fresh, springy, and tartly ferrous.</p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">Sixteen meat dishes on the menu span beef, lamb, and chicken. Some come raw and minced, like the “special kitfo,” which tastes a little like a steak tartare with a jalapeño kick, and others are cut into cubes and cooked, like the <em>yebeg lega tibs</em>, a lamb dish that sings with fresh onions and tomatoes. In <em>doro wat</em>, the chicken drumsticks melt off the bone, and splitting an accompanying hard-boiled egg with hands full of injera is wildly satisfying. Each of the meat dishes is served with two vegetables, and among them the delicately spiced <em>ye misir wat</em> lentils and the <em>shiro,</em> or chickpeas, stand out.</p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">An Ethiopian tale holds that when a goat farmer discovered coffee, monks tried to destroy the drug by burning it. They were soon overcome by the eldritch smell of roasting beans and decided it would be better to distill them. At Abyssinia, if you ask for coffee, the room fills with clouds of frankincense, and the brew is served from a long-necked pot alongside popcorn. After one or two cups, you’ll feel like the monks, renewed and ready for devotion. <em>(Entrées $13-$21.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/07/murrays-cheese-bar-tables-for-two	Murray’s Cheese Bar	264 Bleecker St. 	40.731209	-74.0031901844134	646-476-8882	2016/03/07	<p data-wc="174" word_count="174">If you are the kind of person who, upon hearing that there exists something called “buffalo cheese curds,” can think of nothing else until you eat them, then Murray’s Cheese Bar is for you. This narrow restaurant, cozy-modern with low light and reclaimed wood, opened in 2012, as a kind of annex to the famous Murray’s Cheese Shop, two doors down in the heart of the West Village. The store, established in 1940, was bought by a local businessman in the early nineties and, in 2011, moved across the street from its original tiny corner location into a vast cheese-selling paradise. The new shop was snazzy, for sure, but it managed to keep the original’s cheese-geek optimism alive, offering tastes of obscure delights and inspiring party platters anew, while bulking up with hundreds of fancy, Murray’s-approved pantry products and in-store creations such as house-made pastas and charred broccoli salad. The restaurant was a natural extension of the business—but could it actually be fun? Would too much cheese end up killing the party?</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">It turns out that there is no such thing as too much cheese. While ordering at the Cheese Bar might require some serious self-restraint, it’s possible to keep it simple. A fine meal can be made of fondue (the classic Gruyère with kirsch, accompanied by bread, gherkins, pickled cipollini, and garlicky pepperoni) and sliders (juicy grass-fed patties on slightly sweet brioche buns). For the pro-<em>affinage </em>connoisseur, the servers are equipped to offer a friendly discourse, say, on the “chef’s choice” cheeses topping the burgers, such as Cornelia, “a really good melting cheese, like a funky Monterey Jack, with a washed rind from upstate.” The vegetables, for the most part, have been bombed, for good measure, with salt or some kind of acid or cheese, or all three: charred radishes (with kimchi labneh), kale sprouts (with Sardinian Podda Classico), shishito peppers (with fennel pollen). Pulled-pork-pimento macaroni and cheese, however, goes several steps too far.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">Happy hour is popular, even though there aren’t really deals (the beers are a bit cheaper, but otherwise prices are the same). That’s the time to order those buffalo cheese curds, fried Wisconsin-cheddar morsels doused in a tangy butter-and-hot-sauce concoction. Once in a while, the service might walk a fine line between helpful and not so much, as when a Gorgonzola dolce was described as a “gateway blue.” Does anyone here really need help appreciating blue cheese? Not the kid who followed that up with cheese ice cream. The flavor? Stilton, drizzled with butterscotch. Forgive and forget, and then order the cheese plate, too. <em>(Dishes $8-$26.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/el-cortez-tables-for-two	El Cortez	17 Ingraham St. 	40.7069737647059	-73.9330972941176	347-599-2976	2016/02/29	<p data-wc="154" word_count="154">Stephen Tanner, a former owner of Pies ’n’ Thighs and a one-time chef at Egg, is a founding father of the Brooklyn fried-chicken scene. In 2010, he and Chris Young opened the Commodore, a well-loved Williamsburg watering hole that serves cheap, very good Southern-inflected food in what resembles a basement rec room. Now they have brought their playful aesthetic to Bushwick. From the outside, El Cortez has the look of a Southwestern lodge, complete with a porthole door and an inexplicable totem pole. The interior is split level, with a vaguely Aztec mural and iconic banana-leaf wallpaper. The result is bad seventies kitsch, down to the food and drinks—Tex-Mex and tiki cocktails—and you half expect your server to arrive on roller skates. These references are largely lost on the audience; one Friday evening, a man observed that most of the patrons looked as though they had just barely been born in the eighties.</p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">The central tension at El Cortez is between two menu items: All-American Taco Night and Tacos Du Jour. The former consists of ground beef, iceberg lettuce, store-bought salsa, and canned olives in a crispy taco shell, while the latter is a genuinely good soft-shell affair—the pork well seasoned and the shrimp fresh, accompanied by the canonical cilantro, onions, and lime. Is one of them a wry joke? Not if Tanner’s reported eating habits are to be believed (Checkers and McDonald’s figure prominently). The standard American fare at El Cortez, like a bacon cheeseburger and “chicken buddies”—skewered fried-chicken sandwiches—hits the high-low notes that the Commodore is known for, though the chicken can occasionally be tough. But nachos recently mystified a group of diners—they had been made with the creamy cheese sauce known as queso, and there was so little of it that it was mistaken for sour cream. The taco salad is served exactly the way you want it, in an edible fried-tortilla bowl. But after you finish you might ask yourself, Did I really want that?</p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">With frozen drinks in plastic hurricane glasses and shrimp cocktail served with Club crackers, El Cortez suggests a kind of winking nostalgia for middling, no-frills cuisine. The pitfalls of romanticizing a decade known for culinary mediocrity aside, you can manage to have a good time if you order your drinks from the upstairs bar, where they are made with greater care. And, if you have enough of them, you can immediately satisfy your sudden craving for a deep-fried burrito. <em>(Dishes $6-$12.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/avra-estiatorio-tables-for-two	Avra Estiatorio	141 E. 48th St. 	40.616492	-73.9285669	212-759-8550	2016/02/22	<p data-wc="101" word_count="101">Some time has passed since Lawrence Durrell, in his book “The Greek Islands,” cited a friend’s claim that retsina tastes like “pure turpentine which has been strained through the socks of a bishop.” At Avra, a standout Greek restaurant in a Midtown pocket of skyscrapers that hasn’t quite escaped the Bloombergian thunderbolt, there are three types of the resinated wine, each boasting more organic credo than the next. The best is the Gaia Ritinitis Nobilis, which tastes like a waft of pine-scented air off the back of an Aeolian island in summer’s swelter—fresh and full of possibility.</p><p data-wc="96" word_count="96">The other day, a waiter commented that retsina “does taste better when the sea is lapping your feet.” True though that may be, Avra is the next best thing. In a room accented with muted beiges and browns, drapes hang like sails full with the wind, covering noise-absorbent ceiling tiles, and friendly staff in sand-colored waistcoats shepherd huge fish to tables of suited men and made-up women. On a recent evening, all the noise-proofing in the world couldn’t muffle a casually tanned young gentleman asking his raven-haired date, “Are you a <em>gazeuse</em> person? Sparkling water?”</p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">The only way to start at Avra is with <em>mezedes</em>—dishes that a more trend-conscious restaurant might call “small plates.” There are classics, including grilled haloumi, which has just the right amount of bounce as you chew and swallow, and ouzo mussels in a tomato-infused broth which explode with anise. These compete with a few crossover dishes—Chilean souvlaki places hunks of grilled sea bass over a roasted-red-pepper sauce, and tuna tartare is sprinkled with so much sesame that its flavor profile flits toward the East.</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">At the back of the restaurant, rows of shining fish are laid out in a counter crowned with pineapples, the international symbol of luxury. These fish are Avra’s pride and joy. There are twelve available by the pound, cooked over charcoal, and served simply, with lemon and a caper berry (vegetables come separately). <em>Lavraki</em> (branzino) has a saline char and crunch to it, while <em>tsipoura</em> (dorado) is chewy and creamy. Fresh crustaceans are also a good bet; a recent dish of grilled Nigerian jumbo shrimp was bursting with velveteen eggs.</p><p data-wc="59" word_count="59">Dessert might seem impossible at the end of such a feast, but the <em>karidopita</em>, a walnut and cinnamon-spiced cake, is so good that it seems to fit in even the fullest of bellies. After the cake is consumed, you could be forgiven for seeing the twinkle of the Aegean beyond the lights of Forty-eighth Street. <em>(Fish $29-$53 a pound.)</em> <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/tables-for-two-llama-inn	Llama Inn	50 Withers St., Brooklyn 	40.7167192608696	-73.9507435652174	718-387-3434	2016/02/08	<p data-wc="76" word_count="76">Erik Ramirez, a former sous-chef at Eleven Madison Park, recently opened a quirky portal to Lima, Peru, at a boho-swanky restaurant wedged under the shadow of the B.Q.E. in Williamsburg. While Ramirez’s roots in Manhattan’s anointed temple of fine dining might strike fear in fans of the Peruvian-rotisserie-chicken chain Pio Pio (how can you elevate such perfection?), Llama Inn turns out to be fun, unusual, a little bit goofy, and extremely delicious.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The menu rides the waves of the Spanish, French, Amerindian, Chinese, and Japanese influences of the Peruvian melting pot. <em>Anticuchos</em>, the street snack of grilled skewered meats, included, on a recent night, perfect little bites of char-siu pork belly, topped with homemade pork rinds, and a wonderfully firm and fortifying beef heart. Fluke ceviche, with lime and red onion, was bright and assertive; red-snapper <em>tiradito</em>, sliced into thin pieces and topped with unctuous persimmon and lightly crunchy poppy seeds, was elegant, like fruity silk. Flouting the unspoken rule that quinoa is a bummer, Ramirez mixes it with avocado, thick hunks of bacon, caramelized bananas, and banana mayonnaise, resulting in a sort of improbably irresistible banana-bacon pudding.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">For those who believe that the cuisine of Peru starts at roast chicken and ends at fried potatoes, Llama Inn has you covered. One of two large-format plates is a gorgeous brined, hickory-smoked, garlic-tinged bird, served chili-spiced skin intact, alongside a mountain of potato wedges roasted to a handsome crisp. The sauces on the side make it a party: a creamy queso-fresco concoction, a rich rocoto-chili crema, and a green aji-pepper sauce for a tiny bit of heat. A spectacular <em>lomo saltado</em>, a stir-fry of tender beef chunks in a thick soy-vinegar glaze, is showered with French fries and drizzled with more rocoto crema. As if that’s not enough (it is), it’s served with avocado, pickled chilis, and scallion pancakes, for making Chinese-Peruvian tacos.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">As befits the neighborhood, much attention is paid to the cocktails. The El Chapo doesn’t feel particularly louche, except that it’s basically a goblet of tequila, with a hint of pisco and citrus (“Very spirit forward,” the server offered optimistically); the Flying Purple Pisco, with purple-potato purée and frothed egg whites, is like a tiny lavender-hued soufflé. Pisco buzz aside, maybe the good vibes have something to do with the catwalk of tropical plants ringing the walls of windows high above the seats, or the earthy colors and fibres seemingly sourced from nature. Or maybe it’s the feeling you get from all this lovely food prepared with unpretentious enthusiasm and home-town pride. (Plates $4-$48.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/01/tables-for-two-vaucluse	Vaucluse	100 E. 63rd St. 	37.8500521	-122.2545767	646-869-2300	2016/02/01	<p data-wc="94" word_count="94">When artists argue with critics, wise men and women seek shelter. Pete Wells, the <em>Times</em>’ estimable restaurant reviewer, not long ago went after Vaucluse, the new brasserie from the Altamarea group (Marea, Ai Fiori), whose C.E.O. then responded angrily, and in public. We look to criticism not for truth but as a sort of gladiatorial contest, even a bullfight, with the reviewer in his suit of lights goading the poor creative animal. When the bull writes a letter of protest to the local paper, we don’t know which way to look.</p><p data-wc="76" word_count="76">What, then, does a late arriver to the combat make, fair-mindedly, of Vaucluse? Certainly, with its double-sized rooms and satisfied murmur, it perfectly invokes the Upper East Side: not your parents’ Le Cirque-style U.E.S. of boastful big money but the new, ripened U.E.S., where everyone has been locked in place now for a long time and all know, wistfully, that the really cool places are far, far away, across the East River.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">The lighting, perhaps for that reason, is the kindest, not to say the loveliest, of any restaurant in New York. In one room, hanging linen drums cast an illumination soft and diffuse but not dim—perfect for having a conversation about, say, a Sotheby’s auction or the kids’ tuition. With lighting this beautiful, one might almost be ready to eat badly. In truth, one eats very well, if one’s expectations are geared to the kind of place that Vaucluse is trying to be; as much as Balthazar is a Balzar-style brasserie with elephantiasis, Vaucluse is an outsize copy of the luxe bistros of the Seventh Arrondissement in Paris (D’Chez Eux is an instance)—comfortable, reassuring, and consistently delicious without being at all daring.</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">The starters include a lobster rémoulade—the apple and celery crisp and tart, the seafood sweet. The veal Rossini is a triumph, with a nicely undercooked veal mignon and just enough richness from the little slice of pan-seared foie gras—and just enough mystery from the minced black truffle—to make it work, in a way that the original tournedos version no longer quite does. A plate of striped bass has today’s inevitable Brussels sprouts but also a surprising European crunch of hazelnuts.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/tables-for-two-houseman	Houseman	508 Greenwich St. 	40.02083	-82.9674589	212-641-0654	2016/01/25	<p data-wc="115" word_count="115">Hudson Square, the tetragon between Canal and West Houston Streets, from West Street to Sixth Avenue, was known in the early twentieth century as New York’s printing and engraving district. It has been retooled in the past year as a residential neighborhood, first by a handful of condominium developers and, more recently, by two chefs, Ned Baldwin and Adam Baumgart, looking to attract regulars. The name of their new restaurant, Houseman, is derived from the Norwegian <em>husmannskost</em>, meaning, literally, “house-owner food.” Schoolhouse chairs and warm lighting give it the look of a place you might slink into for roast chicken and a glass of wine when you don’t really feel like going out.</p><p data-wc="247" word_count="247">Houseman does serve a roasted half chicken, but over several visits it was consistently too salty—particularly puzzling, given that Baldwin lamented, in an interview, that “some restaurants will kill you with fat and salt.” The house burger has two small beef patties smothered in a textbook umami bomb: Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. It’s a solid A, but looks so forlorn on a diner plate, accompanied by only a pickle. Fries or salad can be added for two dollars, but one night the former came treacherously oversalted, which was starting to seem like a trend. Lamb meatballs were unctuous, if a bit dry, rescued by juicier pulled lamb meat below, but it was hard to justify paying thirty dollars for only three of them. The most successful dishes were the smaller ones, especially the roasted vegetables. Tender kabocha squash with tiny cubes of feta, chili-pickled currants, pistachios, and lime juice was the strangest sounding combination, but it tasted like so much sense, the bright acid notes balancing the silky and crunchy textures. A dressed egg with parsley and frizzled leeks got a nice savory swerve from anchovy, and fresh green and purple chicories, which looked like individually tie-dyed craft lettuces, were sweet and tender, with a light vinegary dressing that was offset by nutty shavings of Chevrotin cheese. But escarole with maitake mushrooms seemed listless rather than wilted, and the melted Melville cheese under grilled broccoli coagulated and separated, rather than enveloping the veggies.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The menu’s design echoes Hudson Square’s inky past. It reads like a quirky broadsheet, complete with the day’s weather in the upper-right-hand corner (“Sunny, not so terribly cold”). It’s a nice touch, but the scattered, confusing layout can make ordering tricky. Desserts are handwritten on a vintage chalkboard abacus. Baldwin and Baumgart would do well to skip the slate and offer the only sweet treat worth ordering: malt ice cream with a shock of hot fudge and miraculously crisp salted-caramel croutons. It’s outrageously good and tastes both new and comforting. Like the neighborhood, Houseman has real potential, but it needs a few tweaks before it feels like home. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="13" word_count="13"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for dinner.

Today at Lowlife, on Orchard Street, named after the Luc Sante book from which this fact is gleaned, the dining room seats sixty, on leather banquettes and nylon-covered Jens Risom chairs, and, at a sapele bar overlooking the kitchen, ten more. It’s a minimalist experience for the neighborhood, and the food, which is cautiously French with some Japanese influences, follows the feeling.</p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">With that provenance, mushrooms, naturally, take center stage in a number of dishes. Maitake are burnt, crunchy, and a little bit Frito-Lay, with pumpkin and an oozy cheese, as an appetizer. Matsutake, along with mussels, bob in a frothy <em>aligot</em> in one of the restaurant’s more substantial dishes, a sweet tilefish filet with its iridescent scales still on. Portions are rigorously controlled, though perhaps not as much as the sophisticated wine list, which features older, “non-interventionist” vintages. (When a waiter described his recommendation, a Beaujolais, as “almost chuggable,” a brigade of intimidated diners in elastic waistbands breathed a sigh of relief.)</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">You might wish for more of the straightforward flavors, like those in the rustic <em>garganelli</em> with lamb Bolognese, notable for both its rich tomato sauce and its delightfully gratuitous sprinkling of bread crumbs. Or the chicken yakitori, with an exquisite glaze that makes even the accompanying smoked cabbage taste exciting. Other dishes contain sneaky touches, such as the herring and sardine, daubed with a mysteriously creamy sauce, which turns out to be puréed pine nuts, or the dessert of raw milk, which is actually frozen and then shaved into icicles. The result is similar to that achieved by an archaeological dig into a pint of long-forgotten vanilla-bean Häagen-Dazs, except with a frisson of unpasteurized danger. Get your kicks where you can, because Lowlife is resolutely buttoned up. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open for dinner Mondays through Saturdays.

The new Indian restaurant from Jessi Singh and his wife, Jennifer, is loud and boisterous, what with the clanging of stainless-steel plates, the flatware in constant rotation, and the laughter of high-spirited patrons (the forty-five-minute wait is softened with a discount voucher for a bar down the street). The black-and-white dining room is full of quirky touches: diner-bright lighting, Bollywood musicals projected in a high corner, a taxidermied peacock atop a bodega refrigerator full of craft beers.</p><p data-wc="194" word_count="194">Singh hails from Chandigarh by way of Australia, where he honed his playful style. His dishes wear bold garnishes—brightly colored flowers, shredded beets—like edible fascinators. One Friday night, two diners opted for the superb chef’s menu, made up of street snacks followed by the day’s selection of curries, which, on any given night, might include lamb, chicken, or a raw scallop, plus daal, rice, and naan. Singh started with <em>gol gappa</em>, a hollow crispy-fried puri, filled with tamarind, dates, and yogurt. He said, “One bite, please!” and they obliged, though one woman lost her tiny green sprout. Her companion said, “You know, that’s a trend in China,” referring to the fashion of plastic headbands with a single green shoot that took that country by storm this year. Next he brought them crispy croquettes of hung yogurt—the Indian version of Greek yogurt, strained and thick—with a zingy fuchsia-colored beetroot-ginger sauce and an edible orchid too pretty to eat. One of Singh’s neatest tricks was his “Colonel Tso’s” cauliflower, lightly fried and served piping hot in a tomato-chili sauce. This imitation isn’t flattery, it’s superiority.</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">The aggressively casual atmosphere encourages inter-table socializing. On another night, as a gentleman in a trucker hat signed his check, he eyed his neighbors’ massive tandoori tiger prawns. “Do you want some?” they offered. “Make sure you get some of the sauce.” He used his fingers to dip the fatty flesh into a cinnamon-pineapple chutney, wildly sweet and hot. The “unauthentic butter chicken” was a sleeper hit. It sounded bland enough to avoid yet tasted anything but, with a fiery curry of milk, ginger, garlic, tomato, fenugreek, and garam masala. The vegetarian coconut-milk curry contained cubes of squash roasted to such a perfect consistency you might think it was meat. Desserts were all dairy-based palate soothers, like a standout <em>kulfi</em>—a nutty, sweet Popsicle of pistachio and cardamom ice cream—and <em>gulab jamun</em>, cheese dumplings. They tasted like the oiliest doughnuts you’ve ever had, and came topped with gold leaf and a flower that nobody ate. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

Then there are the steaks—bavette, coulotte, Don Ameche, each less than thirty dollars. They sound so exotic, and yet they are so cheap! What’s going on here? The owners—partners at midtown’s fine-dining mini-empire of Quality Meats, Quality Italian, and Park Avenue Winter (Spring, Summer, Autumn)—have decided to offer a true public service, by opening a relatively affordable steak house. When scrutinized, the economics of it are rather ingenious, and, paradoxically, somewhat compliant with the current edict to eat less meat. The heroic catch is that here, with the glamorous low-lit banquettes and the tasteful invitation to debauchery, you don’t even notice.</p><p data-wc="208" word_count="208">Upon hearing the term “flap meat,” you will understand why someone might want to sex it up with a name like bavette. At nineteen dollars, it’s the cheapest steak on the menu; to eat it, you must chew, and chew. (This cut is a muscle toward the rear near the belly—the bottom sirloin butt, if only Letterman were still around to ask.) Chewiness is a common characteristic of the steaks, which also include the coulotte (denser than the bavette), a hangar, and a skirt. Most are seared for a crunchy salted crust and sliced generously, fanned across the plate so you don’t notice what a petite portion you’re getting. But it works, because the quality of the meat is excellent, and why would you need more than five giant slices of beef anyway? The short rib has the beefiest flavor, and is served on the (very long) bone; the Don Ameche (graciously bringing “Trading Places” and “Cocoon” back into the public consciousness) features thick slices of filet mignon atop toast spread with chicken-liver mousse. A fine double-decker patty melt highlights two patties with great personality, layered with griddled sourdough, melty cheese, and a spicy mayo-tinged cabbage slaw. It might be the way to go.</p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">There’s more than just beef. A delicate grilled branzino comes with tangy artichoke sauce, and, of the many decadent sides, special mention must go to the addictive monkey bread, hot super-soft rolls that are pulled apart and slathered with pungent bacon butter that melts on contact. The cocktails are of the overly clever, boldly liquored variety; the Home Alone is “Christmas in a glass,” one diner said, of his heavily pine-scented mix of bourbon, spruce bitters, and cinnamon. Meanwhile, salads and scalloped sunchokes meet dreamy cheese; chunks of avocado and crab are made for each other in a citrus dressing. There’s a crazy wine deal, involving gimmicky yet utterly practical stacked carafes and three wines from a very good list for forty bucks. Reformed gluttons unite. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="13" word_count="13"><em>Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $17-$29.</em></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/21/tables-for-two-oiji	Oiji	119 First Ave. 	51.582639	-0.0167735	646-767-9050	2015/12/21	<p data-wc="130" word_count="130">Small plates, and small-batch soju, are what’s on offer at Oiji, a new Korean restaurant in the East Village. The biggest of the small plates, in terms of food-world hype, are the hot honey-butter chips, a riff on a Korean craze from last year. They are wok-glazed, cayenne-spiced, and positioned, coyly, in a category of their own on the menu: in other words, you could have them as an appetizer or as a dessert, or, more likely, you will wind up doing both. The chips are the only anarchic touch in a dining experience that might otherwise have you longing for the chaos of Koreatown, on Thirty-second Street—as well as for the abundance and variety of banchan, the little dishes served alongside rice in more traditional Korean cuisine.</p><p data-wc="171" word_count="171">At Oiji, kimchi must be ordered separately. The focus is on precise, beautiful compositions of acid and fat, not on the fireworks of fermentation. <em>Chil-jeol-pan</em>, which is a deconstructed bibimbap, is described only as “seven flavors”; “trust us,” the chefs, Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, who were raised in Seoul, seem to be saying. The dish is a clock face of julienned vegetables, shredded beef, and egg. Delicate red and green rice crêpes, for wrapping makeshift tacos, sit in the center. The effect is stunning, and the flavors extremely delicate. The fried chicken might be the most subtle incarnation of its kind. Tapioca flour creates a lace-like skin on a dark chicken cutlet, and the filigreed surface is all the better for soaking up the gentle heat of a soy-based dipping sauce. There is no dousing of anything here; a mackerel filet, smoked in pine leaves, comes with a little brush for patting the fish with a citrus dressing. It looks like a broomstick in a doll’s house.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Deep into the meaty part of the menu come the first truly bold flavors, as in the slow-cooked oxtail, which has a lingering sweetness, and no need for a knife. <em>Jang-jo-rim</em>, a soy-braised beef, is overshadowed by exquisitely buttery rice. There’s a soft-boiled egg, too, but no gochujang, the spicy miso-and-red-chili paste that must surely be the world’s cleverest condiment. In short, the food whispers, to varying effect, and so do the patrons, as the subdued end of the Beatles catalogue plays softly. The best dish is the most comforting: cold buckwheat noodles and preserved spring ramps, in a broth like silk which makes you almost forget that winter is coming. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

One can feel that way about dining out in New York—that the persistence of a few eating places which exist serenely above the storms of foodie fashion are all we have to justify the entire enterprise, though it may be too much to dream of enumerating thirty-six truly righteous restaurants. In the Bloomingdale’s neighborhood, the disappearance of the beloved Subway Inn, whose unforgettable neon sign seemed to have gone the way of all flash (only to reappear, miraculously, a few blocks east), makes the persistence of Le Veau d’Or all the more surprising, and, in its own way, mystically comforting.</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">Le Veau d’Or was, and remains, Manhattan French. Reviews written thirty-five years ago (it opened in 1937 and has changed hands only a few times since) confirm its unwavering nature: those same banquettes, the same Paris street signs, and a bar up front where a few people murmur and drink vermouth. Men in sweaters and women in longish skirts make up the clientele these days, and, if they seem not exactly meatpacking-district chic, they still lean into each other happily on a cold night, obviously in the presence of a treat.</p><p data-wc="169" word_count="169">The menu is mostly unchanged, too—but does this make it timeless or merely dated? The best way to test any cuisine is to eat it in the company of a fastidious sixteen-year-old girl on a perpetual diet. There will be no polite <em>mmms</em>—each mouthful means too much to fake it. With one such teen-ager in hand, we test first the classic starters, asparagus with vinaigrette and a simple green salad. The vinaigrette, distinctly mustardy yet custardy, too, is good enough to induce a sigh in memory of Paris brasseries. You order duck breast with cherry sauce—because who sees <em>that</em> anymore?—and it is delicious, a sliced grilled breast, with the cherry sauce just a little sour. (Are cherries remotely in season? That is a question for another kind of place, and another time closer to this one.) The chicken <em>en cocotte</em> is tasty: if its sauce is a little dull, the unpretentious gratin of potatoes alongside is just what it ought to be, cheesy-sharp but creamy-rich.</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">You order dessert in threes, and here the sixteen-year-old cannot deny herself: the <em>îles flottantes</em> with crunchy burnt caramel, meringue with coffee ice cream, and a hot apple tart. (“Super good,” she says, between mouthfuls.) Add a half bottle of Beaujolais for the adults, and if that and an espresso and Calvados cannot make you happy, nothing will. You leave and hope that the place continues as is, justifying the ways of a Manhattan fantasy of France to future generations of sad and hungry shoppers. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="17" word_count="17"><em>Open Mondays and Saturdays for dinner and Tuesdays through Fridays for lunch and dinner.

It could also be a boon for the latest project from Ravi DeRossi, an Indian-Italian restaurateur, who recently made a wise bet by diversifying his portfolio of indulgence-based businesses (themed cocktail bars and fondue restaurants) to include a new vegan spot in the East Village. DeRossi, who is himself mostly vegan and mostly sober, calls it his “passion project,” along with a vaguely defined new nonprofit, Benefits to End Animal Suffering Today (<small>BEAST</small>).</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">When dining at Avant Garden, you get the sense of having travelled through a wormhole to an alternate universe where animal products never existed, so they could never be missed. As in most dream worlds, a lot of the details don’t make much sense, like the burgundy polyester cloth napkins atop an ostentatiously large slab of brown marble-esque countertop (which turns out to be petrified wood). Just under half of the twenty-eight seats in the restaurant are bar height, but these are the most comfortable stools you’ll ever sit in—upholstered and generously wide for the chic, slim patrons, many of them longtime vegans with the youthful glow of abstemiousness.</p><p data-wc="175" word_count="175">The menu is divided into three parts: toast, cold, and hot. For the toasts, between all the whipped, puréed, and chopped vegetables spread atop thickly sliced Balthazar bread, butter is all but forgotten. (Instead, the kitchen uses various cooking oils, some of which create a sharp smoky smell when they burn; the small dining room could be better ventilated.) Carrot-harissa toast, sweet and creamy yet still vegetal, is the clear standout. A faux ceviche of paper-thin king-oyster mushrooms tossed with white-soy ponzu and jalapeño is refreshingly light and bright, with a meaty bite. Cubed beets and mango over creamy avocado has the look of a tartare but the taste of a zesty high-end guacamole, rounded out with savory notes of black sesame and tamari. Potato cannelloni arrives looking more like a pirouline, and is pleasingly hot, salty, and crispy, a contrast to the thick coins of eggplant “merguez” beneath it, so soft it practically dissolves. Spaghetti pomodoro with capers, basil, and bread crumbs is exactly as it sounds: an unbeatable, already vegan classic.</p><p data-wc="56" word_count="56">But vegans are allowed to have fun, too—Avant Garden’s diverse wine list includes many full-bodied reds, poured generously in oversized glasses. The other night, two young bloggers left the restaurant, giggly and stuffed. They headed off down East Seventh Street, taking no notice of the tiny storefronts serving cupcakes, ice cream, and porchetta sandwiches. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner.

It isn’t particularly fancy (though it is not cheap), and if you want a show with your sushi do not come here. There are no truffles, no pickled Thai chilies, no rock music, no dancing shrimp. Just calm, quiet omakase. It’s rather shocking.</p><p data-wc="279" word_count="279">To get there, you must first announce your reservation (imperative most nights) and wait to be led through the loungelike ground-floor restaurant (the recently renamed Azabu, formerly Daruma-ya, and Greenwich Grill before that) past the dark <em>noren</em> curtains and down a narrow flight of steps. Once seated at the warm-wood bar, you choose a price point (among four), and a Japanese-inflected cocktail or, perhaps, a bottle from forty or so sakes. An epic procession begins: a square of piquant cured tuna, a small ceramic cup of velvety uni risotto, a gorgeous pair of cold kumamoto oysters topped with fresh grated wasabi—when announcing this last part, the young sushi chef, Tasuku Murakami, points to the gigantic gnarled green wasabi root displayed in a case: See? It’s very fresh. Murakami speaks little English and kindly waits until you are done talking—even if this is a very long time—to place the next course in front of you, so he can tell you what it is. After sashimi comes a parade of nigiri, each delicate piece brushed with this tiny bit of sauce or that—<em>kinmedai</em> (golden eye snapper), <em>hirame</em> (fluke), meaty <em>shima aji</em> (striped horse mackerel), silky yellowtail, sweet <em>hotate</em> (sea scallop), torched eel, creamy <em>tamago</em> (egg custard). It’s a very pleasant barrage. The dishes seem to make Murakami happy, and his humble bonhomie—or is it the floral, perfectly dry Tedorigawa sake?—has a relaxing effect. Even though the well-heeled couple at one end of the bar and the politely boisterous millennial Japanese tourists at the other are strangers, by the end of the night all have tacitly bonded, part of an elegant clandestine basement party.</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">Upstairs, in the izakaya, the scene is louder, and less precise. One evening, a waiter mentioned no fewer than three times that Sushi Azabu is a Michelin-starred restaurant, as if the honor extended up the stairs and through the curtains. Not quite. At Azabu, the same sushi you can get downstairs seems too expensive for the casual setting (sashimi plates start at fifty dollars), and the kitchen dishes are hit or miss (baked crab was unpleasantly fishy). But the ladies out on the town, finance types, and soba hounds who come here can eat well, if they order right: uncomplicated, naturally umami-rich dishes like Japanese eggplant, fresh tofu with plentiful uni, and excellent house-made soba noodles. For some, the sound of slurping is as calming as a babbling brook. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="21" word_count="21"><em>Sushi Azabu open daily for dinner; omakase $100-$180.

This particular technique is on wide display at Virginia’s, a new restaurant in Alphabet City from the chef Christian Ramos and the owner Reed Adelson, who worked together at Charlie Trotter’s, in Chicago. From cocktails through dessert, the pleasing sweet-and-sour flavors conferred by fruit, vinegar, and even cheese appear in practically every dish. But, applied as a universal device, the trick results in taste-bud strain.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">It’s enough to induce longing for simple bread and butter. Instead, there’s a starter of two small toasts spread with tangy La Tur goat cheese, covered with chunks of Honeycrisp apple and sunflower seeds—currants are uncalled for but fun, each berry bursting in the mouth like roe. One way to mute acidity is with fat, a tactic Ramos puts to beautiful use in duck rillettes, which play nicely with pickled pole beans and Concord-grape compote. Recently, vinaigrettes factored into a small plate of caramelized romanesco as well as a salad of red-oak lettuces, and were unnecessary and excessive, respectively. Seared cuttlefish with braised kale was leavened with Moroccan olives and chunks of sourdough bread, lest we get a taste of the ocean creature.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">The larger dishes at Virginia’s are better equilibrated, with the exception of a butternut-squash risotto so soupy and sweet that even fishing for the meaty porcini and pecans was dispiriting (the rice was completely lost to a puddle of sauce). Ramos’s technical execution is impressive, and his strongest suit is proteins, cooked to tender perfection. The diver scallops, with Meyer lemon and Seckel pear, and the chicken breast, with fig jam and small, red sweet peppers, were both moist and silken—they could have been served stark naked, their fruity garnishes mere distraction.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">Dessert should be an adventure, not a difficult challenge, and though nothing on the menu from Lauren Calhoun (another chef imported from the Windy City) is too traditional, neither is it too satisfying. The subtlety of raw honey and panna cotta was bulldozed by zesty apricot and sharp ginger, as though someone had turned the contrast way up. And there is no chocolate to be found, unless you count that insidious imposter white chocolate, meekly dolloped over profiteroles and duking it out with inexplicable cashews and apple butter. But there’s hope for Virginia’s: the menu changes seasonally.

Then there’s the waiter’s declaration that “big agriculture is so broken,” which is why the kitchen mills organic wheat berries to create its own flour, as soft as talcum powder and free of pesticides, and which, he says, results in “a lighter feeling in the stomach.”</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">Long explanations are the way it goes at Bruno, where two alums of Roberta’s are determined to make pizza with at least a veneer of virtue. The pies are pliable and toothsome, not bubbly and crisp, and sometimes, as with the abundantly sauced pepperoni pizza, droop under the weight of all those good intentions, and the house-made ranch dressing. Mostly, they are very tasty and a tiny bit confusing, like the one with market greens, a tangle of spiky leaves, said to also come with carrot-top pesto and bottarga, though you’d never know it, aside from a pleasantly fishy funk. Even the margherita has a bite to it, which turns out to be from fermented tomatoes mixed in with the traditional canned. The result is vinegary, tangy, not as sweet as expected. Lovage strewn across the top adds sharpness to a pizza that is traditionally worshipped for its simplicity.</p><p data-wc="169" word_count="169">If you’d like your dinner made more complicated still, well, that’s what the “Market” portion of the menu is for: inventive concoctions of vegetables and fish, manipulated so precisely that you might think of them as Modernist inspired. A dashi broth with apple-cider vinaigrette and boiled ’nduja is somehow meaty and ascetic at the same time, compelling enough to make you forget the main event, sweet potatoes and rutabaga. Celery root three ways (puréed, raw, roasted) might not sound like a good time, but it works, thanks in part to various diversionary tactics, like cured salmon, concord grapes, and Skyr yogurt, arranged around the plate like hours on a melting clock. The sheer prettiness of it all is at times overwhelming and, with the lights as bright as a hospital, can feel like a ploy for social-media love. But dinner here, while uneven, is an adventure, and when’s the last time you said that about pizza? Doing things differently, Bruno knows, will never be easy. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner. Pizzas $12-$20.</em></p>

One answer is to add a regional accent to a cosmopolitan menu. Guy Martin, the chef at Paris’s Grand Véfour, perhaps pioneered this move—while his food is distinctly restaurant-French, his origins in Savoy are emphasized at every meal. Gabriel Kreuther, ex of the Modern and chef of the eponymous new restaurant on West Forty-second Street, tries the same kind of thing with the cooking of his native province of Alsace. Though Alsatian cooking is usually associated with sausages and choucroute, Kreuther fills the interstices in his meals with its bread: fine Alsatian kugelhopf, just to announce that he’s a localist, even if his is a faraway locality.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">Mostly, Kreuther serves an impeccable version of the international style that might be called post-nouvelle, sporadically molecular, architectonic cooking. Post-nouvelle because, indeed, the old protein chunk with cream sauce is gone; waveringly molecular because, though nothing particular may be fished from the Adrià-tic ocean of ideas, eccentric juxtapositions of textures and tastes show lessons learned from the high Spanish style; and architectonic because everything in the presentation tends toward the starkly geometric and three-dimensional.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">Dorade with a green-tomato “marmalade” turns the usually bland neutrality of the simple white fish into complex sweetness, by contrast with the acid-sharp tomatoes. Lamb actually roasted in a small haystack—whether the hay is essential or ornamental is another question—manages to be both delicate and gamy, as lamb should be and too rarely is, while the skirt steak recalls the best of modish braised short ribs. Some of the most delicious things are the little sides presented solemnly as amuse-gueules or extras: an exquisite small plate of fromage blanc with lemongrass syrup, and pumpkin-seed bread with chili-garlic lard. Desserts are very much in the Modern (and postmodern) fashion, familiar palettes of flavors—apples with caramel, chocolate with kirsch—segregated into their parts and built up into fantasy stacks of perispheres and trylons, there for the diner to knock down and reassemble.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">All of this is presented in a beautiful space within what was once a lobby; a gentle play of borrowed wood beams and scrims makes the restaurant feel anything but entry-like. The designer wisely decided not to shut off the space from the street beyond, so that one can actually see the hot-dog dealer on the other side of Forty-second Street, rendered by the veiled light and scrims as plaintive and pointillist as a Hopper drawing. “This place reminds you of what adult life was supposed to be like,” your companion says as you leave, and though a glimpse of the adult life you didn’t get isn’t always what you want in dining, when you do, you can get it, beautifully, here. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="12" word_count="12"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner.

Maybe melon and prosciutto. And caviar blinis. Zinfandel, for sure. All of these things are on display at a new restaurant on Fifty-seventh Street, or, as it is known in the post-Bloomberg era, Billionaire’s Row. Jams is a revival of a place that Jonathan Waxman opened in 1984 on the Upper East Side. It closed five years later, when the stock market floundered, but in the meantime Waxman schooled New Yorkers on the emerging tenets of California cuisine, including menus that change with the seasons, salad as more than an afterthought, and roasted red peppers.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">Jams 2.0 is a relentlessly pleasant trip down memory lane. None of the descriptions require a smartphone to decipher. No one will want for shellfish—it’s in at least three dishes. Gnocchi is not enough by itself, and must be browned in butter. For cocktail hour there are spiced nuts, and for dessert there’s Baked Alaska. Crowd-pleasers all, and so is Waxman. When he’s not at the bar with a sweater around his neck, the bearded, avuncular chef is winding his way between tables, as constant and reassuring a presence as, say, toasted pine nuts, used to best effect in a zippy shaved-vegetable salad.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">After the original Jams came Barbuto, Waxman’s beloved downtown tribute to northern Italy, where the signature dish, twelve years in, remains the roast chicken. It’s unsurprising, then, that the bird here is a standout—juicy and crisp in the right measure, served simply, in a tarragon-inflected jus. Jams’ most famous offering was the caviar blinis, which have been faithfully rendered. The “corn sauce” that accompanies them is more like a chowder, curiously lukewarm and gloopy, but it’s just about the only thing lost in translation. The pancakes are shot through with red peppers, and topped, naturally, with the Greek yogurt of the nineteen-eighties, crème fraîche. The effect is effortless opulence: around the corner from Trump Tower, it’s a reminder that not all resurrections from the era are bad news. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

Last year, the beloved neighborhood mainstay Yaffa Café was abruptly shut down when the Department of Buildings ruled that its back yard, which had been in operation for three decades, was illegal. Earlier this year, Hummus Place, a starkly casual falafel joint, closed its East Village outpost for renovations, only to reappear this summer as Timna, a modern Israeli-inflected Mediterranean restaurant named after ancient cities in Yemen and Israel. This ambitious venture, with cooking by the ex-chef of Williamsburg’s Zizi Limona, Nir Mesika, is more upscale and Pinterest-ready than its predecessor, with exposed-brick walls and air plants dotting each tiny table. A few weeks ago, the somewhat ceremonious dinner service began with an amuse-bouche of creamy, garlicky sunchoke soup—“Butter soup,” one gentleman remarked—a warming salve after the first cold rain of fall.</p><p data-wc="159" word_count="159">Mesika’s food is all over the map, from a gingery “Chinatown” salad of arugula and glass noodles to a more Continental gnocchi and goat ricotta. His executions are, too. The gnocchi are pan-fried to a deep brown, evoking tater tots—at twenty dollars, you’re better off going next door to Crif Dogs for the real thing, at a fifth of the price. But Timna redeems itself by serving some of the most outrageously delicious bread in the city right now. Kubaneh is a Yemenite-Jewish yeast loaf traditionally eaten on the morning of the sabbath, after it has baked overnight at a low temperature. Mesika’s version is served steaming hot in a clay flowerpot, freckled with sesame seeds. Its texture falls somewhere between brioche, challah, and croissant, and it pulls apart like cotton candy. It’s impossible not to finish it in ninety seconds, and the accompanying crushed tomatoes and labneh with za’atar routinely go neglected.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">The dishes are all visually dazzling, and many come dressed with pea tendrils and microgreens, including an appetizer of bright-red cured tuna, quinoa tabouli, beet leather, and light-green tzatziki—mint, parsley, and citrus make the combination taste as bright and acidic as it is colorful. Nutty farro with a trio of vibrant orange root vegetables (sweet potato, butternut squash, and carrot) is offset by light and dark swirls of tahini and date molasses, pleasingly thick, like nut butter. Black-eggplant purée, hummus, grilled pickled cabbage, and salsa were two condiments too many for an octopus tentacle prostrated across a wide plate. Lamb saddle arrived juicy and tender, modestly accompanied by green-pea purée and lentils, but a contrarian dessert of porcini brulée felt like a booby prize—even the marshmallow was spiked with tonka bean, an unusual South American spice. Timna could learn from the old adage: always remove one accessory before leaving the house. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open Tuesdays through Fridays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

The bad news kept coming: bycatch was killing off sea turtles; mercury-laden tuna was so dangerous it caused the sushi addict Jeremy Piven to take sick leave from his Broadway show “Speed-the-Plow”; tilapia, the miracle budget fish, was deemed in some ways worse for you than bacon. To top it off, a series of studies in the past five years found that seafood fraud was rampant, and that an estimated forty per cent of all fish sold in the U.S. is not what the label claims—leaving some people nostalgic for good old “fish” sticks. At least you knew what you were getting.</p><p data-wc="184" word_count="184">Seamore’s, a beachy canteen at the edge of Little Italy, attempts to take the mystery out of fish, purporting to offer only the sustainable and the seasonal, while keeping prices reasonable. On a back wall of the light, airy room, awash in blond wood and seafoam accents, a black-and-white diagram illustrates eighteen local fish; paddles are hung next to the three lucky winners being served that day. Many of the fish are caught off of Montauk (and the Carolinas in winter), and the selection includes less popular varieties, like bluefish, porgy, and tilefish. Among the au-courant starters—guacamole with a touch of cumin, shishito peppers seared and salted, an unsuspectingly awesome kale salad, with a creamy, sweet-and-salty dressing and cubes of avocado and butternut squash—there’s a lovely tuna poke, seasoned with scallions, sesame, and soy. Tacos are a great bet; one night, mackerel tacos were satisfying, if odd, but it was the fried dogfish that everyone wanted. Gorgeous batons were crisped in a fluffy beer batter and topped with chipotle mayo, avocado cream, and shavings of kale, purple cabbage, and radish.</p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">The owner is Michael Chernow, of the Meatball Shop, a mini-chain where diners mix and match their meatball dinners, served with a generous side of booze and sophomoric “ball” jokes. Seamore’s, thankfully, takes the high road, avoiding double entendre while retaining its predecessors’ casual D.I.Y. spirit with “the reel deal”: pick a fish, add a sauce and three sides. Order well, and you’ll have a fish special that’s spectacular in its simplicity. Recently, beautifully seared hake was served with luscious miso butter, farro with olives and sea beans, spinach with almonds, and caper-studded cauliflower. The restaurant’s few missteps include a meagre, over-peppered tuna burger and no fries other than sweet potato. But that overreaching gesture toward trendy health-consciousness should be forgiven, because there are very few restaurants that call such attention to sustainable fish. A sea change takes a long time—why not start with dogfish tacos? <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $13-$21.</em></p>

The famously low-budget spot has, since its TV début in the mid-eighties, gained a second life on YouTube. The couple stand in front of a red-carpeted staircase, on which, their Web site says, brides can be “flanked by two lines of tuxedoed, white-gloved violinists.” As wedding entrances go, it beats tea lights in Mason jars.</p><p data-wc="140" word_count="140">John Kolle, a local entrepreneur who wanted a “temple of music and amusement” for Brooklyn society, built the first incarnation of the Hall in 1892. From the very beginning, the building’s sheer scale has made it difficult to use properly, and it’s been a vaudeville theatre, a movie set, a speakeasy, and a ballroom-dancing venue, and now, on its palatial grounds, there’s a German beer garden. Alice and Michael, who speak in thick Greek accents, had in mind an eleven-story hotel, but the neighbors on the largely residential street weren’t having it. If there’s an element of spite to the endeavor, you’d never know. The experience couldn’t be more convivial, with clusters of Erdinger-branded umbrellas, a loud fountain that lights up in violet, and vast, empty spaces in which kids can perfect their cartwheels.</p><p data-wc="179" word_count="179">As for food, the promises are less extravagant. A chalkboard outside says that it will be “satisfying,” and it is. In the German way, function trumps form, with three schnitzels for the twenty-four beers on tap, and plenty of simple carbohydrates. The basket of pretzels, however, is “for children,” one waiter said, delivering instead an obscenely sized “Uber Soft” variety. Most plates arrive with a clove-heavy sauerkraut and an apple-tinged raw-cabbage salad. Both are fine, as are the jalapeño poppers, though they are not obviously Teutonic. Do not push it with the vegetables. Those who order the pear-and-kale salad, curiously wet, will get what they deserve. The sausage plate is generously portioned, and therefore a triumph. It comes with steak fries the size of a giant’s fingers, and should be explored with a porous, noisy group over several hours on a Sunday afternoon, while sitting next to a stuffed horse, a garden gnome, and a lion carved out of imitation limestone. It’s not a dream come true, but the scene could accurately be described as dreamy. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="14" word_count="14"><em>Open Tuesdays through Fridays for dinner and weekends for lunch and dinner.

Those who claim otherwise are either lying or rare specimens; Brooks Headley is very much the latter. A punk-rock drummer in the nineties and a former vegetarian, Headley has eaten countless bean-and-grain patties, and he began developing his own recipe while he was the head pastry chef at Del Posto. Last year, he sold the burgers at pop-ups around town, to great acclaim, and now they’re flying out the door of his new place, in the pint-size East Village storefront that once housed an auspicious forebear: Amanda Cohen’s popular vegetable restaurant, Dirt Candy.</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">Whereas most veggie burgers are sad, previously frozen affairs, relegated to the edge of the grill and served tepid, Headley’s small, slider-size burger arrives satisfyingly hot. His is quinoa-based, rather than the familiar reconstituted puck of vegetable and soy bits; nuts and aromatic spices lend it a slight whiff of Christmas cake. Headley told the Washington <em>Post</em> that he was working on “the right squish factor”; the patty, when pressed between two halves of a Martin’s potato roll, has the same give as rare ground meat. Mustard and pickles lend the classic McDonald’s tang, and Muenster cheese and a slow-roasted tomato confer umami. A slip of flavorless iceberg lettuce is pure signifier: a cheap fast-food burger would not be complete without it.</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">The hand-lettered menu includes only six other items, two of which basically don’t count (tap water and iced tea). A wrap of brown rice, tofu, cabbage, carrots, celery, and sunflower seeds sounds like vegan punishment but is easily the most complex thing on the menu—it tastes like a creamy, nutty, spicy-sweet curry. The Sloppy Dave, a Joe variation made with tofu crumbles, is a soulless ragù on a sesame-seed roll. On a recent night, a Brit with high hopes for the burnt-broccoli salad with eggplant, red chilies, and coriander vinaigrette declared that it tasted “like a weed roach.” (It was not evident that this was a criticism until the dish went unfinished.) Dessert is a small sundae of creamy gelato and fruit sorbet that can range from punishingly sweet strawberry to alluringly tart nectarine.</p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">Superiority’s most impressive feat is its staff-to-customer ratio: eleven employees to only six seats. Turnaround is personably swift, and constantly changing specials keep regulars coming back. Blistered salt-and-vinegar beans had a perfect balance of salt and acid but tasted little like the “boardwalk-style” fries they were meant to elicit. One man felt that the Philly cheese steak, made with seasoned yuba, caramelized onions, and cashew Cheez Whiz on a roll, upstaged the burger, until it was revealed to him that yuba is tofu skin. But to fuss over the suspension of disbelief involved in vegetarian cooking is to overlook the fact that Headley’s is very fine food indeed. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open Wednesdays through Mondays for dinner.

Located two doors down, this new wine bar with elaborate snacks does its own thing—its name alone suggests a level of liberation that eldest siblings wouldn’t dare attempt—but there is no mistaking the lineage, or the feeling that we’ve seen this before. There’s house-baked bread, three dollars at Contra, four dollars here. The charming mini peasant loaf has a fermented, dense crumb, and is served with an aromatic olive oil that’s refreshingly devoid of descriptors on the menu—this is not the kind of place to serve unprovenanced olive oil, but it also has the good manners not to brag.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">You can’t blame the chefs, Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske, for reprising and remixing some of Contra’s greatest hits; on Wildair’s ever-evolving menu, they dream up consistently interesting tweaks to classic dishes. One night, charcoal-gray squid-ink aioli and fried lemon slices electrified a prim plate of calamari. A generous helping of sushi-standard spicy tuna was spread across vast swaths of bread and topped with an unrecognizable frizzle of scallions, like giant Japanese bruschetta—certain proof, if you needed it, that the eighties are back and better than ever. A small portion of perfectly tender swordfish kept nice company with al-dente cranberry beans and a mild romesco, while a thick slab of breaded pork Milanese found a good buddy in an egg-laden gribiche sauce.</p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">Liberation often goes hand in hand with trying weird new things, and oddities abound here. Tartares, granitas, granolas, and smears (all reminiscent of the original Isa, in Williamsburg, where Stone worked with Ignacio Mattos) keep showing up, sometimes less to comfort than to confuse. The beef tartare, cut in disconcertingly bulky cubes, was topped with smoked cheddar, but all of it was lost to the overpowering flavor of vinegar. Arugula and figs blanketed a strangely flavorless, and seemingly endless, smear of boudin noir, the earthiness of which did little to help the dish. But the scallop tartare, studded with oroblanco grapefruit supremes and sitting in a deep-green pool of zesty cucumber-jalepeño-kale juice, was gorgeous to look at and wonderful to eat.</p><p data-wc="71" word_count="71">Little sisters tend to be cute, and Wildair is no exception—from the preponderance of adorable wine labels (the unexpected list includes mostly organic and natural bottles) displayed on the shelves to the recurring circle motifs in the superb pig-tail-terrine salad, the pork rilettes, the hazelnut tart, and many other dishes, to the Prouvé-lookalike barstools. It might be trying too hard to be noticed, or it might just be original. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner.

Like family style. Or small plates. But Mulino a Vino is actually complicated, beginning with the name, which is an Italian pun. (<em>Mulino a vento</em> is a windmill, and the place runs on wine.) Ordering involves mastering the menu’s taxonomy of food and wine (“Bright &amp; Lively,” “Big &amp; Luscious”), and, within each category, a shaded spectrum measuring intensity of flavor. Each dish is available in three sizes. You may wind up creating your own gradation, from madcap (spiced truffle popcorn) to misguided (anise-and-red-pepper-spiked ice cream).</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">The restaurant’s founding chef, Davide Scabin, is best known for encasing an egg yolk and caviar in a bubble of plastic wrap, at his avant-garde restaurant Combal.Zero, in Piedmont. Though the dishes at Mulino a Vino tend toward the creative end of Italian—<em>cacio e pepe</em> ravioli, wasabi mayo on the salmon confit—there is nothing quite as adventurous as a plastic-wrapped egg. Nor does there seem to be much sign of Scabin, who has gone back to Italy. Buy-in to his scheme varies among the waitstaff. What’s your favorite thing here, one was asked. He thought for a bit. “Victoria’s Secret models come in sometimes.” They drink a lot, he said, and at the end of the night they hug everyone. Looking around, the scene was hard to imagine. The dungeon-like space, gloomy and gilded, like Christian Grey’s guest room, was full of bowed heads—guests deciphering their menus in the dim light. In the corner, a man explained the concept of gravity to his date. Later, in what must have been a Verdicchio-fuelled pique, she asked him if he was a mommy’s boy.</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">The waiter who mentioned the models could tell that the couple on the date were in need; he poured them what he described as a surefire lady pleaser, a Montepulciano with a pink pony on the label. Everyone at the restaurant had their wine brought out on a special tray and strained through a cheesecloth, even if they weren’t buying the most expensive bottle, which cost four hundred and eighty dollars. (The big spenders never tip, the waiter told another diner.) Is it any surprise that the food can get lost in the mix, with so much going on? Many dishes suffer from one ingredient too many—usually black truffle or Gorgonzola, or sometimes both. As in life, it’s best to follow Mamma: the tennis-ball-size meatball is her recipe, and it sits in a bath of tomato sauce the color of persimmons. The three-meat blend is so juicy that it barely needs any sauce. There are plenty more well-handled tomatoes, and a bunch of homemade pastas that are the right kind of chewy. They’re all in different categories of the menu, but each one’s a lady pleaser. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner. Plates $14-$24.</em></p>

Brooklyn’s Ganso Yaki is a self-described casual restaurant, akin to an <em>izakaya</em>, serving drinks and snacks, like yakitori—skewers of grilled poultry, usually chicken. An outcropping of very cheap, very dingy <em>izakayas</em> in the East Village is popular with N.Y.U. students (some are more lax about carding than others), but this is Boerum Hill, not St. Mark’s Place: the T-shirted patrons are two decades out of school and willing to pay more than a couple dollars per skewer. Prices are tweaked accordingly: edamame is six dollars instead of, say, four, because it is a premium variety of black soybean, slightly sweeter and larger than ordinary edamame, and comes dusted in sea salt imported from Japan. Ganso Yaki has the same blond-wood booths as its sister shop, Ganso Ramen, a few blocks away, but it’s more serene and airy: this is upscale casual.</p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">A typical Japanese meal begins with small, delicate boiled and seasoned dishes served cold. On a recent evening, <em>hijiki</em>, a black seaweed, was nutty and tender, and <em>ohitashi</em>, spinach steeped in dashi broth topped with flakes of bonito—dried, fermented skipjack tuna—came perfectly blanched. <em>Hiyayakko</em>, chilled tofu, was too firm to qualify as silken, and was saved from the brink of flavorlessness by ribbons of red onion, shiso, ginger, and more bonito. Of the hot street-food snacks, fried dark-meat chicken was juicy, but the batter was lacking in both crispness and flavor. A waiter recommended dressing the boneless nuggets in a house-made <em>yuzu</em>-chili oil; would that the kitchen had already taken the liberty. Another night, a party of three could barely finish half an <em>okonomiyaki</em>, a traditional thick egg-and-cabbage pancake punctuated with cubes of pork belly. Though it looked just right, topped with a lattice of Kewpie mayonnaise and sweet brown sauce, there was far too much of the latter to keep going after a few bites.</p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">There are standouts, like tempura of kabocha squash, creamy as avocado, and a paddle of shiso, whole and flat like a beautiful leaf pressing. A skewer of chicken-leg meat was tender and thrillingly fatty, and the <em>tsukune</em>, perfectly spiced minced chicken, was the meat log you never knew you craved. These are elevated executions of skewer food—a category so ubiquitous in Japan it has its own emoji. Here the boutique bamboo-speared bites begin at nine dollars apiece, and the bill adds up, slowly but casually. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner.

And so it is at Faro, a new Italian restaurant in Bushwick, where the kitchen makes its flour from grains grown upstate and then turns it into inventive pasta shapes. There’s also a wood-burning oven that does wonders with asparagus and octopus, animal-welfare-approved meat, and a minimalist dining room so cool and spacious that it looks like an imagined Los Angeles.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">You can’t eat the Zeitgeist, though, and the trendy premise of Faro gives way to an oddly old-fashioned meal. This is a polite way of saying that the food is very heavy. The Roman gnocchi, especially when served at the height of summer, will send even the heartiest of eaters into a fugue state as she plows through two huge planks of semolina. They seem the size of Cabbage Patch Kids, and rather than swim in their pool of thick white sauce they sit very still, mollified by a blanket of kale, egg, and Parmesan. Still, polishing off a chewy starch surrounded by cream isn’t exactly hard work. After mining the local-grain porridge for chanterelles, it disappears as well, along with the squid-ink calamaretti, crowned with a wreath of lobster and doused in a cilantro-coconut curry. Lemon’s for wimps, as Caligula probably said.</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">That calamaretti, like much of what’s on offer, looks spectacular: black, red, and green, on a handmade plate from a local studio that designs quirky ceramics for Manhattan tasting menus. You half expect hashtags to form in the steam above it (#NoFilter, #EatLocal). Faro should, by rights, be annoying, precious, and easily dismissed, but there are so many pleasing details, like pickled mustard seeds in the beef tartare, and chèvre cream beneath the fire-roasted beets—not to mention all those idiosyncratic plates scraped clean. Dessert’s a moist, dense cake, like polenta, made with corn ground in house. Whiskey sours are neither local nor new, but they’re good, too. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner. Pastas $13-$20.</em></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/tables-for-two-little-park	Little Park	85 West Broadway 	41.2611835	-95.9140798	212-220-4110	2015/08/31	<p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Andrew Carmellini’s latest Tribeca restaurant has a conundrum that could be filed under Good Problem to Have. The vegetable-focussed food is so good, so gorgeous and seasonal, that the setting, a curtained annex to the Smyth Hotel that has changed hands twice in the past two years, feels incongruously dispassionate. The blond-wood tables with straw-colored banquettes are nice enough, and the room is hushed and tasteful, but how lovely it would be to eat this exuberant food, like the luscious pea soup, in a garden! (A New Yorker can dream.) The soup is made from the freshest peas, puréed into a cool, thick Kelly-green cream, topped with a crunchy little salad of minted sugar-snap peas and a scoop of horseradish ice cream—this is the exquisite taste of summer.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">How is it that the tomatillos, tossed with white cabbage and cilantro, sitting quietly at the side of a house-made-duck-sausage banh mi, taste like such sweet, healthy candy? At lunch recently, this was preceded by more tomatoes, multi-hued heirlooms, prettily mixed with green Castelvetrano olives and piled on top of a spelt crisp spread with garlicky white-bean purée. The tomatoes’ strong competition for best appetizer was the utterly unsuspecting beetroot tartare. A disk of shredded cooked beets sounds the opposite of exciting, but there it was, with horseradish cream and a buttered rye crumble and topped with smoked trout roe, like some kind of perverse, delicious beet Brown Betty. Last place went to the obligatory burrata, which was sadly dry, and given little help from macerated strawberries, even though they were the tiny, ostentatiously natural variety.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">Summer has been good to Little Park, but Carmellini doesn’t just do vegetables. Grilled sardines are tangy with vinegar; tuna crudo is extravagantly garnished with microgreens, beech mushrooms, and Fresno pepper; dreary farro tagliatelle is made fun with crab, asparagus, peas, and a lemon kick. A hefty aged lamb porterhouse is served on the bone with fermented hot sauce; strip steak is charred to medium rare. It’s not until the meat comes out that you realize there’s not a starch in sight. Fries with that steak wouldn’t kill anyone, although the tangle of dazzlingly bright greens is quite distracting.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">The room may be subdued, but that afternoon it was livened up by a waitress with the guileless charisma of Sandra Bullock in her rom-com heyday. When asked what to do about dessert, she explained her predilection for the malted-milk panna cotta: “I’m a Whopper person.” Sounds like fun. Even better was a moist blueberry cake with corn ice cream. It will be interesting to see what Carmellini can do with the grim array of local root vegetables of a New York winter. But first, September should be glorious. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $15-$34.</em></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/tables-for-two-the-black-ant	The Black Ant	60 Second Ave. 	-33.97483	18.5004701	212-598-0300	2015/08/24	<p data-wc="121" word_count="121">This summer, Twitter was set ablaze by a controversial recipe for guacamole that called for green peas. At the Black Ant, in the East Village, the house guacamole varies; it has been studded with garbanzo beans, fried corn, orange slices, jicama, radishes, and even cheese. But it is always finished with ants. The garnish, to be precise, is <em>sal de hormiga</em>, or salt with ground-up <em>chicatanas</em>—large, winged leaf-cutter ants, harvested once a year, in the Mexican region of Oaxaca. The ants taste somewhere between nutty and buttery, with a chemical tang, and lend the salt a bit of umami. There are no peas in sight at the Black Ant, where unusual ingredients are esteemed and insects are the crown jewels.</p><p data-wc="88" word_count="88">Unless you know the Spanish word <em>chapulín</em>, you may not realize that the shrimp tacos are battered and fried in a crust of grasshoppers, creating a deliciously recursive arthropod. On the <em>tlayuda</em>, a crispy corn tortilla topped, like a small pizza, with black beans and soft cheese, the sautéed grasshoppers come whole and taste exquisitely of chili and lime. Pluck one from its lily pad of avocado cream, pop it in your mouth, and don’t forget to chew, lest any legs stick in your throat.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">You might have to Google some Nahuatl words to navigate the menu, but the more unusual the dish, the better. If it sounds familiar—like beet salad or miso black cod—you can probably skip it. One evening, a salad arrived with a pile of lettuce leaves, soupy with too-sweet dressing, very few beets, and two dollops of mysteriously tangless whipped goat cheese. An exception to this rule is the short rib, which swims in <em>mole chichilo</em>, a unique execution of the complex, earthy sauce that, unlike a more common <em>mole negro</em>, does not include chocolate but instead relies on blackened dried chilis for a rich, complex char.</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">Mole, insects, and corn are all Oaxacan staples, and the abstract-expressionist streaks and dots of sauce on the plates here are mere diversions from what is really a loving homage to that Mecca of Mexican cuisine. On its Web site, the restaurant seems to delight in the cross-cultural gross-out potential, and leans a little too heavily on Surrealist signposts like Dali and Buñuel, with a nice nod to the former’s repulsive ants. The result is a bit of a mixed message: with the exception of a giant multicolored ant painted on the back wall of the dining room, the bugs at the Black Ant are nothing to be afraid of. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="13" word_count="13"><em>Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

You can either get a lot of sushi, which is the omakase option, or slightly less sushi along with some “composed” dishes, the kaiseki. Either way, most of it is prepared and delivered over the counter by Jimmy Lau or Nick Kim, the owners and head chefs, who used to work at the city’s priciest restaurant, Masa. The two of them understand the rich well enough to know that the only thing they like more than spending money is getting something for free. That would explain the service—is it paranoia, or are the high rollers getting more fish?—but also, following an exquisitely refined meal, the bonus: apple pie, a gloriously unreconstructed hunk of it.</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">But there’s serious work to be done before brown sugar and streusel. Out comes a parade of sushi, though the chefs identifying their creations don’t always make themselves heard over Drake or Jay Z. Guessing games ensue: “Did he say scallop sperm?” He did, and it’s mild, sweet, and a little bit wobbly, like custard. Trying so many new things, without always knowing what it is you’re trying, is disorienting, but certain ingredients serve as comforting through-lines. Shiso leaf, astringent and clear, is there at the beginning, with pistachio miso on top of homemade mochi; again, nestled under a streak of sea bream; and then, at the end, wrapped around a pickled lotus root. What are Thai bird chilis doing on top of grilled toro sinew? It works, just like the heat of Sichuan peppercorns with cold ocean trout. But the biggest surprise is how, through all the many courses of nigiri, the rice itself remains interesting. It lolls around the mouth long after the Santa Barbara uni has slipped away. The number of courses might be hazy, but those grains of rice—you can count them. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open for dinner Mondays through Saturdays.

Known in Malay as <em>belacan</em>, that stuff is the key to much of the Singaporean “hawker food” now being served in the space that housed Wong’s eponymous restaurant, which closed last summer for a revamp. Chomp Chomp is named after one of Singapore’s more famous food centers—large, open-air complexes with stalls selling cheap, classic Southeast Asian street fare. The restaurant is less frenetic than its namesake, but the room can get loud, and the impressive food arrives in the same colorful melamine dishware.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">Wong’s aim is less to intimidate you with spice than to woo you with depth of flavor. The eclectic assortment of dishes has influences from China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Shrimp—whether whole or pulverized, fresh or fermented—is the great unifying taste. On a recent visit, buttery, cereal-encrusted head-on prawns, fried to a satisfying crisp, were bravely eaten whole. In an appetizer of chicken wings and Chinese celery, a shrimp-paste rub provided a pungent, garlicky funk (the effect is not unlike the ineffable magic that anchovies add to Caesar-salad dressing). Prawn <em>mee</em>, a noodle dish with spare ribs in a spicy shrimp broth, came with a Chinese spoon filled with <em>sambal</em>—a spicy condiment made with, you guessed it, shrimp paste.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">There are non-fishy flavors, too. A curry of tender lamb <em>rendang</em> is described as “slow cooked lamb shank in a million spices,” among them lemongrass, coriander, and star anise. Hainanese chicken rice is a simple, classic hawker dish of silky roasted chicken—the rich skin of which is neither too soft nor too stiff, and exudes soy and sesame—with a side of ginger-garlic rice cooked with chicken broth. A lot of hawker food falls under the banner of “tastes much better than it looks,” including <em>oh luak</em>, an omelette with plump oysters loosed from their shells, and <em>chye tao kueh</em>, called “carrot cake” in Singapore, though it is neither carrot nor cake in the traditional sense. Cubes of shredded, compressed daikon radish, fried and tossed with shrimp, Chinese sausage, and a healthy dose of shrimp paste, evoke pork-belly fat, in a good way.</p><p data-wc="64" word_count="64">Do not skip the cocktails. Try a margarita made with <em>calamansi</em>, a mandarin-kumquat hybrid, or the piña cha cha, the smoothest colada you’ll ever taste. Hidden in the latter are cubes of grass jelly, a Chinese dessert that tastes slightly bitter and slightly floral, like tea. For dessert, get the banana fritters, eat them hot, and wait for the kiss of spice. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

Where does the fry end and the fish begin? The chili-lime aioli on the side isn’t saying. Order a champagne cocktail on a Tuesday night at the bar, and the spiral of lemon rind bobbing on the bubbles looks like it’s having more fun than the clientele. It’s hard to believe that the Knick, recently converted from offices back into a hotel, was once a drinking spot so beloved that, six years into Prohibition, this magazine was still lamenting its closure and, with it, the loss of Maxfield Parrish’s famous mural of Old King Cole and his jolly attendants. (The mural now hangs across town in the St. Regis’s bar, which has been more persuasively resurrected.) Encased in marble, sheathed in chain-metal drapes, the dining room is so insistently anonymous that you’d never know it looks out on the Crossroads of the World, or even on one of the city’s larger H&amp;Ms—let alone that Enrico Caruso sang from the balcony of this hotel on Armistice Day. One of the Martini’s many origin myths swirls, vermouth-like, around the bar, circa 1912. And, in 1919, perhaps anticipating the need for a stiff drink, the owner of the Red Sox, Harry Frazee, met the team’s manager at the Knickerbocker to tell him that he was selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees.</p><p data-wc="190" word_count="190">In the restaurant today, the tuna tartare, served icebox cold, is not nearly as disappointing an event. On the bright side, hotel restaurants, including this one, are probably the only places where you can begin dinner with fried chicken, chase it with a salumi plate, follow up with Asian-inspired sea scallops, and end with crème brûlée. They are certainly the last venues serving grilled romaine or deconstructed niçoise salads, in which the splayed string beans are rigorously and mysteriously quarantined from all the good stuff (quail egg, anchovy, tuna). But that which is familiar needn’t feel so confining. On a recent evening, a family new to the city said they were hoping for some ice-cream sundaes. An oversized map of Manhattan could only entertain the kids for so long. But there were no sundaes, only chocolate mousse, with chocolate ice cream, and chocolate sauce on top. It looked severe, and, even for a dessert, seemed like a slog. The family retreated to their room, and the dining area was quiet, except for the rustle of someone reading that morning’s <em>Financial Times</em> in the corner. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Second St. 	41.64538	-83.5253139	212-335-0114	2015/07/20	<p data-wc="144" word_count="144">When Cookshop opened, in 2005, in west Chelsea, it was on the cusp of both the farm-to-table explosion and a sea change in the neighborhood, driven by a migrating gallery scene and the impending High Line. Serving ethically sourced rotisserie chickens that all but had names à la “Portlandia” and intelligent tweaks on American classics, the restaurant, run by Vicki Freeman and her husband, the chef Marc Meyer, appealed to a new breed of conscientious aesthete, and it has lived on as a popular spot for a lovely meal, all the way down to dessert. The two also run Hundred Acres, in SoHo, and Vic’s (a reimagining of their first restaurant, the well-loved Five Points), in NoHo, both of which offer variations on the Cookshop formula. So Rosie’s, their new Mexican restaurant on a sleepy East Village corner, is a curious, and ambitious, departure.</p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">As the loquacious servers will tell you, Rosie’s strives for authenticity. The corn is stone ground in the basement. The comal, a tortilla-making station in the center of the room, is where the <em>antojitos</em> (little whims) are made, from homemade masa dough (from the corn ground in the basement). Chef Meyer, travelling once in Michoacán, asked for hot sauce, and this is what he got: a dark-brown salsa made from peanuts, pumpkin seeds, and chili oil. It’s a strange concoction, an accompaniment to baked cheese crisps in a snack called “chicharrón de queso,” and it turns out to be the most surprising, and most wonderful, dish of the evening. The offerings from the comal are hit or miss, often seeming like stacks of disparate, well-sourced ingredients that don’t quite come together. And the hand-pressed corn tortillas are on the dry side—though the crispy-edged pork in the tacos <em>al pastor</em>, juiced with pineapple, and the firm, tasty mushrooms mixed with poblanos in the <em>hongos</em> tacos, make fine fillings.</p><p data-wc="62" word_count="62">The place gets packed for dinner, when girls’-night posses descend for watermelon margaritas and guacamole. The waitresses wear short, calico-print dresses, and have the spirit of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. The mesmerizing room brings to mind a seaside vacation—all teals and pale blues, walls retracted for veranda-style dining, even if the breezes aren’t Gulf or Pacific but Second Avenue.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">A dish of Jonah crab exemplifies the greatness that Rosie’s can achieve. Never mind that the server, gregarious in every other way, neglected to mention that the crab would have to be cracked and dismantled at the table, by the diner. Maybe that was wise, since anyone who would want to order crab knows that cracking one is an ordeal—who wants to be covered in crab guts on girls’ night out? But, after a bout of wrestling, a forkful of sweet crab meat was finally dipped into a sauce of toasted garlic slivers and rich guajillo-chili-infused oil, and there was peace. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

Eight years after that album, and four years after the band played its farewell shows at Madison Square Garden, Murphy has willed his wish into being, with a captivating wine bar in Williamsburg. He can be seen there frequently, with his wife, Christina Topsøe, who is also a partner in the restaurant, and a fluid circle of drinking companions.</p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">The atmosphere alone could be enough to warrant a visit: a burlap-walled, cedar-accented party hosted by a low-key, affable celebrity. “We’re music writers,” offered a pair in contrasting flannel shirts, who explained one recent evening that they’d travelled across town to catch a glimpse of Murphy. Once he’d been spotted, a glass of marmalade-colored Languedoc in hand, the music writers made quick work of a plate of prosciutto and calculated an intricate split of their bill. A food writer, though, was also gratified, by the garlicky jolt of the aioli on patatas bravas; steak tartare in puddles of buttermilk; a pork shank with shelling beans made summery with strands of zucchini and dollops of salsa verde. There was a spectacular salad of snap peas, shot through with chili and Microplaned out of sight by a blanket of ricotta-salata cheese. Consider that a calling card from the chef, Nick Curtola, who came from Franny’s; his vegetables taste like treats, in a style familiar to acolytes of Park Slope’s unofficial clubhouse.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">Best of all, though, is the way the unpretentious waitstaff talk about the wines. The “What do you like?” approach—an attempt at solicitousness that manages to be completely unhelpful and intimidating—is banished. Instead, there’s a brief list, and a firm hand. In the mood for a glass of red? “There are two Gamays. One has a baked-raisin vibe.” (Wine that sounds like a scone is hard to pass up.) By the time a late-night June rainstorm appears, and the subway’s lesser, more beige lines are being contemplated, Murphy has migrated from a table to the bar, where the bartender is pouring a quietly effervescent rosé out of a not so quiet magnum. As Murphy has noted, New York can bring you down. It might do so pretty soon, as you stand on the J-train platform. But tonight, it bought itself some time. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner. Plates $13-$20.</em></p>

The air was sweet with smoke. “Oh, oh!” he said. “Oh! This is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten.” Another night, another man: “Oh, yeah!” he exhaled, closing his eyes as he savored an earthy mouthful of warm, bright fava beans tossed with craggy morels and rich crumbles of crimson-tinged blood sausage. <em>Lupulo</em> is the Portuguese word for hops, as in the flowers that are a key ingredient of beer, and the name is hardly arbitrary: there are a dozen beers on tap, and an enormous U-shaped bar takes up half of the capacious dining room. But to describe Lupulo as a beer bar, or the menu as “beer food,” would be misleading, not least because the beer here is as versatile as wine, carefully curated to be far-ranging, surprising, and unimpeachably interesting.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">And while the food and the beer pair beautifully—the deceptively simple charred chicken with the sour, fizzy Rodenbach Grand Cru, for example—the existence of one doesn’t depend upon the other. The chef, George Mendes, born in the U.S. to Portuguese immigrants, earned a Michelin star with his first ode to the old country, Aldea. His razor-clam-and-cucumber salad—the former sliced into silky pendants, the latter in raw matchsticks, charred cubes, and pickled half-moons—needs nothing to enhance its briny symphony. Salt-cod croquettes are deep fried but betray no trace of grease, their exterior as delicate and resilient as an eggshell, cracking open to pillowy potato flecked with fish. The tart, spritzy Bayerischer Bahnhof Berliner Style Weisse, which goes down as easy as lemonade, is great with anything.</p><p data-wc="199" word_count="199">For those who prefer their yeast in solid form, there’s an unusually bountiful bread basket, brimming with squishy sourdough, coarse cornmeal <em>broa</em>, and chorizo-flecked rolls. It comes with just a splash of olive oil, which might be a helpful signal from the kitchen to not eat it all at once; you’ll need it later. Giant, ruby-red prawns known as <em>carabineros</em>, flown in seasonally from Portugal, are grilled, head on, until they’re just cooked, their perfume nearly floral, their flavor lush and buttery. At thirteen dollars per shrimp, their juices must be sopped. <em>Caracóis</em>, meaty little knots of de-shelled snails, arrive in a pool of lusty <em>alhinho</em>, a traditional sauce of garlic, paprika, and parsley which would be a shame to waste. With the rib eye, a marvel of meat, pliant and funky after sixty days of aging: purple potatoes, blistered on the grill. For dessert: a wedge of soft, grassy sheep’s-milk cheese with a pouf of pastry, a smear of quince paste, and a scoop of kaffir-lime sorbet. The gracious staff gives none of the “You should feel lucky to be here” guff so prevalent in restaurants of late. The irony is, you should. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner. Entrées $14-$45.</em></p>

On an unremarkable graffiti- and scaffolding-covered stretch of East Houston Street, her eponymous basement-level B.Y.O.B. café is a true “hidden gem,” straight out of “Let’s Go: New York City.”</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">From the signs for free Wi-Fi to the red plastic water tumblers and the vitrine tables overflowing with magazines, the café feels like the communal space of a youth hostel. One Saturday evening, a woman wondered aloud how she would be able to enjoy her meal with the severe face of Ruth Bader Ginsburg staring back at her from the cover of <em>Time</em>. Soon enough, the table was overtaken by a platter of parchment-thin bresaola carpaccio and an umami bomb of rich, creamy burratina cheese mixed with sautéed mushrooms and enough fresh parsley to qualify as a side salad. Nearly every dish at Gaia comes with plastic serving spoons and a crumpled foil trough full of freshly house-baked focaccia soldiers. The same bread, cracker-thin and lightly toasted, is also used for scandalously cheap five-dollar panini, piled high with wide ribbons of mortadella, prosciutto, or speck.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">Hot dishes and pastas arrive briskly, in aluminum pots reminiscent of a cheap camping-stove setup, belying their bona fides. One night, two types of ravioli were sublimely al dente: spinach and ricotta with bacon, in tomato sauce, and walnut, stuffed with sweet mascarpone and strands of radicchio sliced as thin as saffron threads. But it was the fresh-made tagliatelle, in a spicy tomato sauce with clams, shrimp, octopus, and eggplant, that commanded seconds and thirds. Bagnasacco’s oven-baked dishes satisfy cravings for simple, homemade food, such as meatballs and potatoes generously dusted with Parmesan crumbles. The only misses on the menu—beans with sausage, cabbage salad—involve too much of what tastes suspiciously like Frank’s RedHot.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">Bagnasacco controls every last detail about her café, from the early kitchen closings (at seven Tuesdays through Thursdays and eight on Fridays) to the language on the menu (“Fruit juices are delicious,” “Let’s try if you like them”). She is strict but fair (reservations are required after five o’clock), and famously defensive on her own Yelp page (“Where are the educated customers?”). She appreciates courtesy, and may send you home with cookies and Nutella pastries; if your manners are lacking, she may chide you. One night, she told a lingering group, “Don’t get too comfortable, we are closing soon.” The café is less a restaurant than Bagnasacco’s kitchen, and she rightly commands your respect. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="12" word_count="12"><em>Open Mondays through Saturdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

He moved there in 2005, “from a swanky but soulless place in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle to a swanky and soulful brownstone apartment,” he wrote in his 2012 memoir, “Yes, Chef.” The neighborhood, he was delighted to realize, “was not just black U.S.A. in a snow globe; it was one of the last bastions of New York City as creative people long for it to be.” In 2010, he opened Red Rooster, a swanky and soulful restaurant on Lenox Avenue, and began to establish himself as Harlem’s veritable mayor, enticing local regulars—including, especially, the creative élite—plus visiting V.I.P.s and celebrity-chasing tourists, with an elegantly global menu, effortlessly combining the flavors of the American South, Ethiopia, Sweden, and beyond.</p><p data-wc="96" word_count="96">This spring, Samuelsson doubled down on his community outreach and introduced Streetbird, a more casual venture with an emphasis on rotisserie chicken, eaten in or taken out. If, with Red Rooster, Samuelsson tread gingerly as he sought acceptance from the object of his affection, he’s confident enough now to shout his adoration from the rooftops. The new place is a lively, endearing but painfully unsubtle homage to Harlem through the decades, from the graffiti on the rafters to the sneakers dangling from the sprinkler system and the booths upholstered in Louis Vuitton and Gucci leather.</p><p data-wc="206" word_count="206">The menu, too, is a riot of references: red-velvet waffles and chicken, Return of the Mac (and cheese). But what comes out of the kitchen tends to fall short of its promise. The glossy-skinned rotisserie chicken is proficient but ultimately unspecial. The Sho’ Nuff Noodles are an overly faithful ode to take-out lo mein, and the crispy chicken in another vaguely Chinese dish called Mama Said Wok You Out is less exciting than your average General Tso’s. Two salads—the Fly Girl and the Grace Jonezz—turn out to be indistinguishable heaps of shredded and underdressed lettuce. If the lesson seems to be that Harlem can’t be bottled, there’s a certain irony to the fact that Streetbird’s condiments are a bright spot, particularly the sweet and spicy Jamerican sauce and the Bird Funk Spread, an oily paste of Chinese sausage, dried shrimp, and fermented black bean, which comes with Auntie’s Cornbread. The best dish—the Swediopian, a sort of boat made from spongy Ethiopian injera bread filled with tender, vinegary collards, the hearty Ethiopian chicken stew known as <em>doro wat</em>, creamy curds of fresh cheese, and crumbles of hard-boiled egg—is the most creative. What could represent Harlem better than that?</p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dishes $7-$16.</em></p>

That place, Spring, is known for its precisely composed plates, which, even as they toy with ashes and foams, skirt fuss. Now a chef who ran its kitchen, Daniel Eddy, has come home to his native New York. At Rebelle, on the Lower East Side, Eddy has, in a very short time, become a flag bearer for the newly formal strain of downtown dining. Rebelle is one of those places that regard the wine with as much seriousness as the food, with a list that verges on a tome, and a sommelier eager to show off the funkier corners of his cellar. The waiter, meanwhile, is more focussed, and asks that each diner pick one dish from each of the courses. Stern, sure—but also a source of relief, a welcome bit of bossiness for diners accustomed to juggling small plates that arrive on the kitchen’s idiosyncratic schedule.</p><p data-wc="178" word_count="178">So, four courses, fifteen hundred wines on offer, and food that looks like it involves tweezers but also tastes good. Much of the menu involves American tweaks to Gallic classics: fried shallots on a lamb tartare haven’t been put to such good use since last Thanksgiving’s green-bean casserole, and the creamy lobster sauce on sweetbreads evokes a New England chowder. A first course of fluke and lemon sounds familiar, but then you taste the brown butter and sherry and it’s new. What’s best about Rebelle is that it is contemporary but not trendy. There’s a vegetable in quotation marks, and it’s not gimmicky: a velvety, rich “beet” bourguignon, better suited to May in New York than its beefy brethren. The cherry clafoutis is to share, a spontaneous act of generosity from the kitchen, hearty and delicate at the same time. It wears a jaunty hat of Chantilly cream. By this point, there has been a lot of wine. The experience is gouty but elegant, and, tonight, the Bowery is our Boulevard Saint-Germain. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open for dinner Mondays through Saturdays.

It is her favor you must curry in order to get a table—not to mention something to eat—at Astoria Seafood, where she serves as both the hostess and the only waitress. By 6 <small>P.M.</small> on a recent Saturday, the nightly test of her resolve was well under way, as the place teemed with pushy patrons, desperate to catch her eye. They wanted seats, they wanted seafood, they wanted Greek salad and extra forks and bottled water. In the middle of the madness, she looked up from her notepad and said, “Oh my God, I’m getting dizzy!” Someone flicked a light switch off and on for a strobelike effect. A male voice hollered “<em>Opa!</em>” and the room erupted in cheers.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Queens is often cited as the most diverse of the city’s boroughs, and the demographic cross-section on display at Astoria Seafood, which has been owned for three generations by the same Greek family, is straight out of a political-campaign ad. People of all ages, ethnicities, and economic brackets are drawn by a powerful common denominator: fresh fish, prepared simply and sold at a fraction of what it costs almost anywhere else. Here’s a foursome of Rag &amp; Bone-wearing, chopstick-wielding Japanese hipsters, picking at a dense and meaty grilled mackerel; there’s a group of cheerful Turks pouring shots of raki and feasting on fried calamari. “It’s like jury duty,” marvelled a bespectacled young white guy, as a pair of middle-aged African-American women eyed his empty plate, looking hopeful that he might soon vacate his table.</p><p data-wc="197" word_count="197">Once just a retailer and wholesaler, the operation expanded into restaurant territory after moving from Astoria to Long Island City, several years ago. After jostling for a spot on Helen’s list, diners must elbow their way to the glistening piles of fish on ice at the back of the room. There’s a box of clear plastic bags, to be used both as gloves to scoop up whatever looks best—Caribbean snapper, river trout, scallops, super-jumbo shrimp—and for carrying the haul to the cashier’s counter, where it’s weighed, flung into a metal bowl, and added to the cooking queue. The options are few: grilled in olive oil and fresh herbs, or breaded and fried. It’s hard to go wrong. Aside from the bountiful Greek salad and some satisfyingly run-of-the-mill garlic bread, side dishes—soupy platters of lemon potatoes, pasta salad with imitation crab—tend not to materialize. Helen can only do so much. And so what? On a recent evening, a diner inquiring after a couple of missing king-crab legs was met with the kind of response that embodies the place: “Oh, sorry about that. The kitchen forgot. It’s O.K.” <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="16" word_count="16"><em>Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner. Seafood sold by the pound at market prices.</em></p>

Today, lots of people live there—the young and the moneyed, mostly, in big glass condos. David Chang’s newest, grandest restaurant is at the end of the block, with twenty-three seats, which are booked weeks in advance, and a hundred-and-seventy-five-dollar tasting menu. The chefs, enclosed within a U-shaped bar, are the literal center of attention. There are seven of them, mostly dudes in black T-shirts, and they dole out uni from a wooden Japanese tray, spray atomized sherry over a coupe glass, and deliver brusque sermons on obscure ingredients like finger limes.</p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">The evening’s performance, which takes about two and a half hours for around fourteen courses, is probably good for couples who have run out of things to say to each other. Guests approach the meal with diligence. One night, a man in a springtime scarf asked how something should be eaten: a wisp of uni and a scoop of fermented chickpea paste, in a pool of bright-green olive oil. The chef who delivered the dish, and who had explained that the purée was developed in the Momofuku Food Lab, shrugged. He was probably right to suggest that it didn’t matter—the dish was lovely, briny and citrusy in equal measure, and uniformly velvety—but it was hard not to feel a pang of nostalgia for waiters, who at least have to feign interest in the diner’s experience.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">The traditional signposts of a tasting menu were all there—bread, pasta, fish, then meat, even petit fours—but the meal was disconcerting as well as delicious, which was maybe the point. Among a parade of canapés, a conceptual take on potato chips and pimento cheese was strange and cold. Later, a bowl of scrambled eggs and caviar was irresistible almost by definition, and all the more so when piled on top of the superlative house-made sourdough. Following the haute stoner food was a new kind of bolognese, orecchiette and octopus with a lingering taste of soy. Along the back wall, a butcher’s wunderkammer of splayed chicken feet and venison loin promised much, but in the end there was just one meat course, a perfect portion of glazed duck breast in XO sauce.</p><p data-wc="60" word_count="60">Chang has taught us at once how to take food more seriously and consume it more casually. The coasters are local and artisanal, but you clean up your own crumbs on the marble countertop. Everyone’s too busy spooning pineapple dashi into a petri dish dotted with hydrated basil seeds to scrape your mess away, and thank goodness for that. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open for dinner Wednesdays through Sundays.

The façade of Racines NY, an outpost of a pair of successful neo-bistros called Racines, in Paris, is obstinately unchic. Inside, the bare-bones exposed-brick décor is less French sophisticate than generic financial-district drinking establishment. But once you sit down to order a glass of wine, from a list that is, as one bartender put it, “off the beaten path,” you realize that these people know what they’re doing. The name means “roots,” and from the savvy sustainable wines to the thoughtful service and the impeccable tweaked versions of French standards, Racines NY pays homage to tradition with a keen eye toward evolution.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">Start with the bar snacks, urban and modern, not too racy. Chicken-liver pâté comes in two scoops whipped light as air, topped with sea salt, on a small granite board, next to a pile of olive-oil-grilled toasts. It may be disappointing to find that they don’t have Sancerre (the path was beaten for a reason), but they do have an unusual Menetou-Salon Sauvignon Blanc that turns out to be a smart substitute. <em>Panisse</em>, crunchy fluffed rectangles of fried chickpea dough the size of your grandmother’s Club crackers, arrive in a tiny cast-iron pot. Pork rillettes are so very French, the shredded pork mixed in with mild fat, without even a glance at American barbecue.</p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">When the appetizers arrive—burrata with black-olive-dressed salad, bouncy razor clams over squid-ink spaghetti in a lobster bisque, escargot with roasted-garlic Chantilly mousse and a saffron-potato <em>cromesqui</em> (fritter)—you start to wonder about the chef. Who is this guy? He is Frédéric Duca, who left a Michelin-starred restaurant in Paris to cook here, and, thus far, he seems to have stayed under the radar, even if his cooking is much more Estela than La Grenouille.</p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">Hunks of meat are barely cooked, or cooked just enough, garnished with bright sauce and one or two stalwart vegetables. On a recent night, lamb saddle appeared as a beautiful specimen, cut thick and seared medium rare, like the best steak, dressed with harissa paste and salsa verde and, to keep things interesting, wilted bok choy. Monkfish secured its position as the poor man’s lobster, studded with hazelnuts and sunchokes. But Duca out-Frenched the French with a special: a tourte of exceedingly rich quail breast, foie gras, and duxelles of shitake mushroom, baked in a shiny discus-shaped pastry shell and served in a pool of amber-colored beef jus. A petite frisée salad and two crispy quail legs come with it; get there early, as they make only four or five of these exquisite monstrosities each night. Wasn’t it the French who proved that unchic is the most chic of all? <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner.

In the morning, El Rey looks like any other tiny, barista-operated café on the Lower East Side, enticing caffeine junkies in leather jackets and statement shades with locally roasted, single-origin espresso drinks and a small selection of pastries. But when the clock strikes eleven the bar is raised: plates of real food begin to appear as casually as lattes and cortados, so elegantly composed that it’s startling to realize they’re being made behind an unassuming counter at the back of the room. Chia-seed pudding, heaped with coconut flakes, pomegranate seeds, and nuts; wedges of roasted kabocha squash over smears of thick yogurt, scattered with salty granola; the world’s best kale salad, tossed in a chunky dressing made from ground almonds, almond milk, garlic, and lemon zest, and even better adorned with avocado “del sur,” sliced into half-moons and spooned with chimichurri and pickled red onion.</p><p data-wc="222" word_count="222">By evening, the lights have been dimmed, the iced Mexican mocha (made with condensed milk, mint, and a hint of Aleppo pepper) replaced by cucumber-shiso sangria and the michelada-like El Rey Delfina, with pilsner, Worcestershire, and lime. On a recent weeknight, the narrow high-top tables were occupied almost exclusively by women, discussing weddings, Carrie Brownstein, the merits of “Gone Girl” versus “The Girl on the Train.” A pair of blondes who run an Instagram account called Yes Way Rosé nursed a deep-pink Côtes de Duras from 2013, which went perfectly with thin slices of marinated chorizo and hefty slabs of caramelized-garlic focaccia. The “vegan chicharrones locos” turned out to be not a concession to animal lovers so much as a take on a popular Mexican street food, chicharrones de harina, which happen to be vegan: ridged wheat puffs fried golden and bombed with raw vegetables (cucumber, jicama), candied peanuts, pineapple-habanero hot sauce, and cashew crema. The chef, Gerardo Gonzalez, grew up in San Diego. For a dish inspired by a kitchen-sink snack, he takes a crunchy corn tostada, slathers it in a luscious whip of butter and Greek yogurt, then layers on meaty chunks of sardine and coins of radish and purple carrot, finished with a bright, herbaceous carrot-top vinaigrette. It’s surprisingly tidy, snapping apart neatly for sharing, and utterly satisfying.</p><p data-wc="53" word_count="53">Dessert at El Rey is as yet nonexistent, but Gonzalez’s partner is the restaurateur Nicholas Morgenstern, whose namesake ice-cream parlor is just a short walk away. A scoop of Morgenstern’s salt &amp; pepper pinenut, drizzled in sesame caramel, raises the question: have we been expecting too little of our ice-cream shops?</p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open daily for morning coffee, lunch, and dinner.

Instead, a bottle of Viognier turns out to be the perfect apricot-scented complement to big-eye-tuna <em>poke</em>—and if the table won’t have white, there’s a muslin-covered book of other French wines, assembled thoughtfully by one of the three Per Se alums behind the restaurant.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">Noreetuh’s sophisticated wine list is the scaffolding on a menu that embraces both the high and the low of Hawaiian food. It is a rebuke to the once prevalent fantasy of a Polynesian Disneyland, and a reminder of the long migration of people from China, Japan, Portugal, Korea, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia to the Hawaiian Islands. It is also frequently delicious, and unintentionally, perhaps, forces a rethink of the widely maligned genre of Asian fusion. Upgrading <em>musubi</em>, Hawaii’s favorite gas-station snack, takes guts, or rather, tongue—the corned-beef kind, which sits in place of Spam on top of the cilantro-infused rice, wrapped in a package of nori. That’s not to say there aren’t opportunities to eat the “Hawaiian steak.” Spam tortellini could be just a gimmick, but even Italians might have to agree that there are worse things to stuff in a pasta shell than spiced pork.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">The blending of traditions is consistently smooth, as in a shallow bowl of tofu swirled with uni, ikura, and shiitake. It’s cold, velvety, a little bit louche. A busy hearts-of-palm salad is a precise calibration of crunch (crispy shallots), ooze (smoked tofu), and clutter (beets, cilantro), and almost enough to redeem the official vegetable of the nineteen-eighties. The kitchen’s commitment to fun in every bite extends to even the most prosaic-sounding dishes, like the chow noodles, made up of uniform slivers of bean sprouts, shiitake, and spiced tofu. The occasional lily flower nests amongst the foliage. Or take that <em>poke</em>, a plateful of raw, sesame-oiled tuna, texture-heavy with chunks of macadamia, slices of jalapeño, and springy tassels of seaweed. You’re on St. Mark’s Place, but the taste is unmistakable: saline, like a gulp of seawater when you dive under a wave. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

The latest—and most ambitious—addition to her mini modern-Israeli restaurant empire is Bar Bolonat, in the West Village. Previously home to a cheap Thai restaurant, the corner space is now sleek and spare, more dressed-up Danish than Balaboosta’s tchotchke-filled dining room. The eclectic menu draws on Admony’s Iranian and Yemeni heritage, and with cocktails more cleverly named than executed—Simcha (Hebrew for “joy”) and Yalla (Arabic for “hurry up”)—the over-all effect is Levantine chic.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">Admony’s fans may recognize menu items from Balaboosta, like the signature fried olives in a pool of strained yogurt and harissa oil, best eaten right away, before they have a chance to cool. Fluke ceviche, with shaved fennel, pomegranate seeds, and pistachios, is reminiscent of a recipe that was executed across town. But Bar Bolonat is no copycat of Balaboosta—if the two restaurants were sisters, they’d be fraternal twins who share interests but not clothes, because one has more expensive taste. Where the firstborn is a free spirit who wears embroidered linen dresses and has a boyfriend with a Star of David tattoo, the second opts for a tailored velvet blazer and cropped pants and is engaged to a corporate lawyer. Which would you rather go to dinner with?</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">There are worthy originals at Bar Bolonat. Braised lamb neck is perfectly tender, the better for everyone at the table to pick at, and a wild-mushroom pasta is elevated by onion with the grainy char of an expertly cooked pizza. Admony has a talent for multitasking texture: a falafel crust on the grouper lends a nutty crunch, and cacao nibs enhance her Middle Eastern twist on mole. Her riff on <em>fesenjān</em>, a Persian-inspired concoction of pomegranate and walnuts, was so tangy-sweet one night that it nearly overpowered a succulent young chicken.</p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">Some new dishes that use Admony’s favored ingredients surpass their forebears. Lightly battered cauliflower is revelatory with peanut tahini and Bamba (an Israeli peanut-butter-flavored puffed-corn snack), and subtly better than lemon and pine nuts. But on a recent evening, corn purée and red-pepper coulis did little to save a chewy piece of octopus (served in Nolita with a carrot sauce). Admony still has the most important basics down pat. Her za’atar, an addictive blend of aromatic dried herbs and salt, comes with a sesame-seed-covered Jerusalem bagel (baked, not boiled) instead of pita bread. She would do well to sell the stuff along with her cookbook, available at your favorite spot—Admony isn’t allowed to pick, but you are. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="13" word_count="13"><em>Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

The hulking Italian oven in the back has been compared to a Ferrari and a Stradivarius, but in twelve months two other pie joints that used it closed. One of the co-owners of Prova is also a partner in Sushi Nakazawa, and, with this pedigree, the restaurant emphasizes out-of-the-ordinary toppings for its <!--span id="incorrect">Neopolitan</span>--><span id="correct">Neapolitan</span> pizza. Expectations on a recent evening were high for the “Uni-ca,” each slice drizzled with squid ink and garnished with a curl of sea urchin. The mix in temperatures, necessitated by the fact that no one wants warm uni, turned out to be unnerving, even distracting, and, as with all of Prova’s pizzas, the slice was so heavy that it had to be eaten de Blasio style, with a knife and fork. And yet this was almost impossible with another pie’s puréed peas and smoked mozzarella, which, as if not entirely set, became a scalding soup, slipping off the crust.</p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">Prova’s promise is “ninety seconds to Naples,” which is perhaps not long enough; at Marta, another new pizza restaurant, it’s more like ninety minutes to Rome. That’s because reservations are hard to come by, which is what happens when Danny Meyer and Nick Anderer, of Maialino, open a place. But the wait, on couches in the lobby with one of the two types of bottle-aged Negronis, is not unpleasant, and, once seated, the service is as crisp as the pizza. “Pizza Romana” translates to a thin crust, like matzo, sturdy enough to handle bold and plentiful toppings. On the puttanesca, anchovies, which announced themselves with a metallic gleam, were even fresher and funkier than expected—more than cursory salt bombs. The <em>patate alla carbonara</em>, made moist with cubes of potato, tasted intensely of salt and pepper, worthy adversaries for the pie’s rich layers of egg and two types of cheese.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The flavors at Marta are so assertive that one slice of each pizza is often enough. Fortunately, there are standout dishes across the menu, like the herby, charred rabbit meatballs in a puddle of dreamy ricotta; a stunning, intricate roasted-beet salad with fronds of fried kale sprouts (a new hybrid of Brussels sprout and kale, the vegetable kingdom’s coolest kid); and a slow-roasted lamb shoulder, made in the sizable smoker, stage left of the two pizza ovens, which would be the pride of any restaurant. The icing on the cake, though, is the olive oil on the affogato: poured from high over vanilla gelato at the table, and sap green like spring. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Prova, pizzas $10-$29.

It seems especially egregious in a city so full of both places to eat and displaced Texans. So word spread quickly about Javelina, a restaurant near Union Square claiming to offer “true Tex-Mex,” as advertised by a green neon sign that casts an eerie glow over a row of tall cacti just inside the door. Within days of opening, reservations were already hard to come by, with wait times creeping up to two hours.</p><p data-wc="207" word_count="207">The people wanted their enchiladas and their fajitas, but, more than anything, they wanted their queso. <em>Queso</em> is the generic Spanish word for “cheese,” but Texan queso, also known as chile con queso, is a very specific dish, taken very seriously, and, naturally, a source of great debate, down to pronunciation: “keh-so” not “kay-so,” according to <em>Texas Monthly</em>. Opinions and recipes vary, but it seems generally agreed upon that the cheese should be mild and melted to a Velveeta-like consistency, mixed with chiles, then scooped up with tortilla chips—preferably of the sturdy, crunchy, salt-flecked, golden variety, like the ones that come in a basket, still hot from the fryer, at Javelina. These are complimentary, along with a sweet, smoky salsa; the queso is compulsory, but must be ordered separately. There are two kinds: yellow and white, the former slightly runnier, with a distinct subtle tang and chopped tomatillo and serrano, the latter a bit more creamy, offset by jalapeño and roasted poblano. Both get a dollop of pico de gallo, can be further jazzed up with a variety of toppings—guacamole, chorizo, ground beef—and wash down well with an avocado-cilantro margarita or a Smoky Negroni, made with habanero bitters and mezcal instead of gin.</p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">It’s hard to imagine eating anything else after all that melted cheese, especially because it’s hard not to eat all of that melted cheese. In its early days, the kitchen at Javelina seemed like it was still getting its footing beyond the queso. The avocado in the avocado tacos turned out to be fried in a flavor-diminishing floury coating. The chicken-fried steak lost any crispness it once had under the weight of a creamy gravy. The parrillada mixta, or mixed grill, on the other hand, was a sight to behold: a cast-iron contraption piled with fajita-style sliced chicken and steak, shreds of carnitas, peppery jalapeño sausage, bacon-wrapped shrimp, and plump drumsticks of barbecued quail, sticky with a honey glaze. With an assortment of accoutrements, including a stack of tortillas and a softball-size scoop of sour cream, it could happily feed a family of six. “Serves 1-2,” says the menu. Texas portions. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

The mussels come in a garlic-white-wine sauce. The waiter says there aren’t any this evening. A bowl of mixed olives is eight dollars. (“Kalamata, Niçoise, Cerignola, green” is the explanation.) Mains include salmon <em>à la vapeur</em> and a mustard chicken, like at a wedding or in seat 60D on a long-distance flight. And the mac and cheese is twenty dollars, because someone thought very hard about truffles when making it.</p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">The problem with Happy Ending is that you can’t eat a double entendre, though the proprietors of this nominally French restaurant would have you try (the “foie gras happy ending” is served with a wan fig-and-plum chutney). The name, a nod to the space’s onetime incarnation as a massage parlor, is borrowed from the most recent establishment, a bar. The last Happy Ending had anything but—it closed in 2013, many years after its glory days in the mid-two-thousands, when it was rife with birthday parties, bachelorettes, and complicated group checks. The restaurateurs are determined to once again create a scene, and they have some experience in conjuring the long-necked and the big spenders; Café Select, on Lafayette Street, irrefutably trendy with a Euro crowd a few years back, was theirs. There is certainly plenty of life as the night wears on: jazz standards played on a piano in the restaurant, and increasingly energetic dancing in a downstairs boîte.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">But as a hostess reminds diners, a restaurant reservation is no guarantee of entry to the subterranean level. And not every windowless room with a piano can be the Carlyle. So for those stuck aboveground, or eating before 9, there are quotidian concerns, like protein: a duck breast cooked so emphatically that it tastes like the filet mignon, and four chunks of salmon that never stood a chance against a garrulous green-curry sauce. Generally French standards, served under helpfully low lights, seems to be the concept. Maybe they should have stuck with drinks. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open for dinner Tuesdays through Saturdays.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/tables-for-two-the-polo-bar	The Polo Bar	1 E. 55th St. 	40.059499	-85.6754779	212-207-8562	2015/03/23	<p data-wc="182" word_count="182">Ralph Lauren’s Polo Bar is misleadingly named, considering that it comprises a full kitchen and dining room, below the lavish, eponymous bar; but to call it a restaurant isn’t quite right, either. It’s more like a club, with an elusive membership structure: to get on the list for dinner after five-fifteen or before nine-thirty, you simply have to be somebody—Matthew Broderick, for example, who went nearly unnoticed, one evening, in the shadow of Rihanna and Naomi Campbell, paparazzi hot on their trail. In the opening monologue of “Annie Hall,” Woody Allen used the Groucho Marx line “I would never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member,” but, nearly forty years later, he looked right at home as he made his exit, hand in hand with his wife. For the average Joe who snags an off-hours reservation by calling a month in advance, the Polo Bar is like Disneyland for celebrity gawkers, the sort of place where “Should I get a baked potato?” is easily misheard as “Is that Channing Tatum?”</p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">The Polo Bar is like Disneyland for horse enthusiasts, too—and an answer to the question of what you get when you beat a dead one with a polo stick. There are paintings and photographs of the animal and its most patrician sport everywhere you turn, as well as artfully hung saddles, helmets, and crops; even the cocktail stirrers look like miniature mallets. The live-like-a-blue-blood siren song of the Lauren brand vibrates extra loudly here, where the service achieves butler-level attentiveness (“Pardon me, my lady”) and the hand-stitched leather banquettes are lined with plush throw pillows in the same custom plaid as the baby-doll dresses worn by the smiling hostesses.</p><p data-wc="181" word_count="181">The menu consists mostly of straightforward, clubby classics: a perfect iceberg wedge; chicken paillard topped with grilled endive and meaty roasted hen-of-the-woods mushrooms; a salty, satisfying bacon cheeseburger with the platonic ideal of French fries, spilling out of a sterling-silver cup. In a nod, perhaps, to Lauren’s previous life as Lifshitz (the name he was born with, in the Bronx), the corned beef on marble rye is designated as “Ralph’s”—but we’re also told that he favors the Ranch House Chili, and one can only imagine which of his private chefs, on which of his ranches, came up with the recipe. For dessert, there’s a fudgy brownie, topped with a scoop of vanilla and warm chocolate sauce, or Ralph’s coffee ice cream with dark-chocolate shortbread cookies. It feels good to live like the one per cent. By the coat check on a recent night, a group of besuited middle-aged men appraised a large oil painting. “Reminds me of my polo days,” one said. “In Brooklyn.” He looked wistful. “No, but, seriously, have you ever played polo?” <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/tables-for-two-cafe-clover	Café Clover	10 Downing St. 	51.50344025	-0.127708109585621	212-675-4350	2015/03/16	<p data-wc="96" word_count="96">In a city where you could theoretically eat a different preparation of pork belly every night, there are two things that might make Café Clover a tough sell. The first is that the menu was designed with the help of a nutritionist aiming to shave off calories wherever possible. The second is that this temple of wellness is situated at Manhattan’s most vexed spot, at least for restaurants: the corner of Sixth Ave. and Downing St., where a triangular room with the feel of a cruise-ship bow has thwarted the ambition of so many chefs.</p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">The oddly shaped space has been made to look as lovely as it can be; Aegean-blue banquettes help. And, sure enough, all the usual health foods are in attendance: flax, chia, sunflower seeds. In fact, these three are combined into an aggressively gluten-free cracker, served in lieu of bread, with butternut-squash hummus. Whence the cracker’s binding agent? Hard to say, because it disintegrates into a hundred tiny pieces when subjected to the mildest of stress tests: a dip. As long as you’re prepared to eat your vegetables, and then eat them again, the meal picks up from there, with a memorably sweet tarragon dressing on a gem-wedge salad; baby beets and apples toughened up with hardy little sprigs of lovage; the unexpected addition of blood orange to ribbons of kale. That there’s a bowl of the distinctly unglamorous celery root on almost every table, tossed with rutabaga in an Indian-inspired dressing, is a testament to the power of cumin to make just about anything interesting.</p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">Sometimes the judicious distribution of calories renders things a little flat: halibut quivering like a poached egg on grilled salsify tasted as white as it looked, and, even though it would make things easier for everyone, spaghetti squash is never going to convincingly stand in for pasta. (It comes with organic Scottish salmon and black-trumpet mushrooms.) “Thoughtfully portioned options,” says the bottom of the menu, which sounds vaguely threatening, even Bloombergian, but turns out to be just fine, really—how much more of the cauliflower “steak” in a pool of romesco do you want? Even if most diners are there to feel better about eating out after SoulCycle or ModelFit, the kitchen’s use of unusual ingredients guarantees a worthwhile discovery or two. White lentils, for instance, in a truffle risotto. Or teff, from Ethiopia, served as a remarkably light multilayered crêpe cake, making a persuasive case for toppling quinoa as ancient grain of choice. The cake comes with an excellent mascarpone mousse and an espresso chocolate sauce. Enjoy in moderation. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

Vaguely foreign, it is pronounced “TOE-mee,” which is how the chef Thomas Chen’s parents, immigrants from China, said his nickname, Tommy. Chen, thirty years old, is a New York native and has cooked at Commerce and Eleven Madison Park; now he has his own ingredient-driven, sans-serif venture. As is the case with so many young people striking out on their own, his first quarters, in the East Village, are tight, and the two spare dining rooms reflect the neighborhood’s no-frills sensibility. The food is fusion with a straight face—“contemporary American” with strong Asian influences in every dish.</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">The menu is not intimidating. In the bluntly titled “small” category, the devilled, panko-crusted egg topped with mounds of chili is a must. A recent execution produced a series of sublime sensations, from the crunch of crumbs to the bounce of the whites to the spike of spice, interrupted ever so slightly by a garnish of micro Thai basil. A lone curl of octopus arrives looking positively vertebral, until it meets a foam the color of buttercream—a fingerling-potato-and-brown-butter emulsion, released from the nozzle of an iSi cream whipper. The tentacle rests atop a bed of caramelized chopped pork XO, a spiced concoction that gives the meat a fishy taste—a clever match for octopus, the meatiest of seafoods.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">“Big” dishes are straightforward: chicken, beef, and fish. Chicken arrives two ways: sous-vide then pan-seared, and fried. Paired with charred lettuce and arranged atop a basil-jus-sweetened, congeelike rice porridge, it narrowly escapes entrée fatigue, even if the breast is dry. Beef short rib with sweet-potato purée is <em>déjà mangé</em>—a luxuriously tender iteration of meat and potatoes. The standout dish is a humble side of sticky rice, leavened with duck fat, served steaming on a lotus leaf. You will spend the rest of the evening digging for coins of spicy sausage you may have missed.</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">Tuome is unstuffy and comfortable, and its food is comforting. You could order all of these things and have a very fine dinner, finished with beignets made less bland by goat’s-milk caramel, red-bean-glazed ice cream, and citron marmalade. Or you could live a little, and try the “Pig Out (for Two)”: ten perfect squares of Berkshire pork belly, served with two individual bowls of spicy peanut noodles. The skin is as crisp as a hard candy shell, and cracks apart to reveal a perfect packet of rich, fatty meat, all sweetened with a drizzle of hoisin. It’s forty-nine dollars; don’t overthink it. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

Half an hour had passed since she and her companion had high-fived upon sitting down at Mu Ramen, the brick-and-mortar incarnation of Josh and Heidy Smookler’s lauded pop-up, and now they were scraping their bowls. If Mu exemplifies the argument, put forth by David Chang on the Web site of his food quarterly, <em>Lucky Peach,</em> that innovation in American ramen-making has plateaued (“Ramen is dead”), none of the people at the restaurant’s Tetris-shaped communal table seemed to care. Nor did those waiting for their seats, who were perched like the audience at a runway show along the perimeter of the mood-lit room, and staring as intently. Everyone had heard the buzz that this ramen might be the city’s best.</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">Mu’s ramen is above average, to be sure. But at this strange cultural moment in which Jewish-Japanese food is verging on passé (see: Shalom Japan, Ivan Ramen, Dassara), the namesake Mu—featuring a marbled slab of tender pink brisket and matchsticks of crunchy half-sour pickle—feels old hat, if well executed. The combination of twenty-four-hour pork-bone broth and butterlike pats of pork-jowl chashu in the Tonkotsu 2.0 is almost laughably rich, as are the <em>tebasaki</em> “gyoza,” an Instagram-ready appetizer of deep-fried boneless chicken wings oozing a thyme-flecked foie-gras stuffing that tastes oddly of Thanksgiving. A sweet, fluffy spin on the traditionally savory Japanese pancake known as <em>okonomiyaki</em>, drizzled in foie-gras-maple syrup and layered with smoked trout and tobiko, is a model of restraint by comparison.</p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">Meanwhile, in Manhattan, a newcomer called Ramen Lab eschews ramped-up trends in favor of classics, honed to perfection. You stand at a counter, Tokyo-train-station style, in this narrow storefront, where conversation is precluded by exhalations of transcendent satisfaction. The two custom varieties of fresh, springy noodles come from the Sun Noodle factory, whose corporate chef, Jack Nakamura, runs the kitchen. The thinner version is for a bright, clean shoyu broth, glistening with rendered chicken fat and topped with chashu, chopped greens, and a sheet of nori—a combination so good that it’s hard to think, while eating it, about anything other than when you’ll get to do so again. The thicker noodle belongs to the XO Miso, whose designation as vegetarian might scare off carnivores. Their loss: although pork can easily be added, it’s entirely unnecessary, given the umami complexity of the creamy miso-and-oolong-tea broth, garnished with a nutty pile of barley and black rice, left over from making soy sauce. If ramen is dead, Ramen Lab must be Heaven. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="22" word_count="22"><em>Mu Ramen is open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Ramen $15-$18.

There’s an express elevator to the trattoria from the building’s nose, at Broadway and Thirty-fifth Street, which bypasses the perfume sellers, the fur salon, the opaque taxonomy of women’s attire (“impulse casual,” “junior misses”). But most of the diners seem to have fully committed to the experience: staggering off the rickety wooden escalator, through the linen department next door, travelling in multigenerational packs whose collective optimism faded two floors ago. Who said shopping was fun, again?</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Fortunately, a soothing menu of Italian standards awaits. The executive chef, Jarett Appell, seems to understand what is demanded from the department-store restaurant: nostalgia, fried calamari, chopped salads interesting enough to be entrées. And yet dishes consistently produce yelps of delight from the table, as with a B.L.T. on pagnotelle bread, a blistered house-made pocket of pure crunch. Or the vitello tonnato, dressed with a light tuna-confit vinaigrette rather than with the usual sludgy mayonnaise. Of the pizzas coming out of three wood-burning ovens, the one with cauliflower, cream, and Meyer lemon is the clear winner. (Gratin should always be served on bread.) By dessert, the elegant plating of an almond cake with careful frills of poached pear surprises no one.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">There is a single moment of tension, when an order of lobster creste di gallo gets a warning from the waiter. “That’s going to be a little spicy,” he says beneath a furrowed brow. It’s not, really, but he was right to say so, because the meal is characterized by mellowness. The space itself is a pleasant anachronism, a ballroom of soaring ceilings and Juliet balconies. It could be the uptown digs of a deposed dictator, except for the Victoria’s Secret models captured mid-writhe on the billboard outside, and the wall of cheerful Robert Risko portraits, which, on closer inspection, depict “Macy’s personalities”: Michael Kors, Ryan Seacrest, Martha Stewart.

It’s the undisputed opening of the season, and reservations are famously hard to come by. The phalanx of hosts stare at seating charts on their iPads with the grim, protracted confusion of airline check-in agents. The main dining room is past a long wall of curious Old World wines—the restaurant may be Mexican, but that’s no excuse for a margarita. Seemingly everyone has ordered the chef Enrique Olvera’s signature “burrata and weeds” dish, and, like that twenty-four-dollar appetizer, they ooze money. Should Cosme need a mascot, the man at the next table will do, in his fedora and mock turtleneck, looking like an angel investor on “Silicon Valley” and asking for another round of premium-tequila shots. If you build an expensive place in the Flatiron district, he will come.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">That Olvera has made such a scene must not detract from his food, which is uniformly better than the crowd it draws. His restaurant in Mexico City, Pujol, is thought to be one of the world’s best, and the smoked raw sepia will show you why: a tangle of translucent, slivered strands, tossed with the simplest of tomato salsas. The taste of the ocean announces itself as a zephyr, not a squall. The octopus cocktail is an agreeably blunt counterpoint, a lilac-colored soup with the consistency of drinkable yogurt, in which purple and blue corn and charred avocado bob alongside tentacled slices on the right side of chewy.</p><p data-wc="193" word_count="193">Cosme falls for the trend of the half-empty oversized plate, now an accepted shorthand for seriousness in the restaurant world. So be it. The small dishes that begin the meal are better anyhow, like the uni tostada, which demands to be passed around the group in traditional dorm-room fashion. It is mysteriously funky and strangely gelatinous. That’s the bone marrow, an ingenious marriage of earth and sea, all mellowed out with a smear of avocado. One bite is perfect, and enough. Another winner, and a guarantee that you’ll never look at Sabra the same way again, is the bean salad, actually a purée drizzled with habanero vinaigrette. There’s cucumber in the dressing, too, prepared the way all vegetables should be, which is charred to the point of somehow tasting like bacon. But, if you’ve paid any attention to the hype, the entire endeavor might be a very delicious excuse for dessert: a corn-husk meringue with its own hashtag, possessed of an intensely milky taste from the mousse of mascarpone, cream, and corn purée that spills out like lava from its core. All is forgiven. Even the iPads. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner.

It’s easy to feel nostalgic for red sauce and cannoli, and for a romanticized neighborhood whose heyday has so definitively passed. But on a January night, when temperatures have dropped into the teens, it’s easier still to dart into the clean, bright, tastefully decorated dining room of Beijing Pop Kabob, huddle around one of the ten-odd tables, and start blowing on the tall glass brimming with scalding hot black-and-jasmine tea that you are served immediately.</p><p data-wc="194" word_count="194">Warmth is a theme here, with the kitchen turning out the food of Beijing and, more broadly, northern China, where winters are long and cold. The menu has only a small selection of dishes explicitly designated as soup, but many others are liquid-based and served atop Sterno flames, accompanied by small bowls for sharing. “Boiled sliced whole fish in hot chili oil” and the “fisherman’s spicy boiled beef with tofu” are indistinguishable but for their main ingredient: a big bony tilapia and oversized, thin-cut swaths of chewy beef, respectively. Both come in the same rich red stock, crowded with silky tofu, mandolined celery, and floppy wood-ear mushrooms, like deflated miniature parachutes. Homemade Beijing noodles with “shrimps and peanuts paste” turn out to be linguine-width and bathed in a thick, peanutty pork gravy; the same noodles with “chicken and shrimp paste” come in what’s essentially a bland but comforting egg-drop soup. Most effective of all may be the stewed duck in beer, for which the bird, skin on and bones in, is hacked into chunks and boiled in a lager-heavy broth, which is piping hot and yet still tastes and smells intensely alcoholic.</p><p data-wc="175" word_count="175">Dishes marked with a thumbs-up are “what is nice”; a flame indicates “optional spicy or not.” Some get both, including the namesake kabobs: plump cubes of chicken, beef, or lamb grilled into juicy caramelized meat candy on a stick, tangy with cumin and chili. It’s difficult to grow rice in northern China’s dry climate, but wheat is put to good use in steamed dumplings and fluffy pan-fried buns, both filled with pork and leeks, and floury scallion pancakes rolled up around cold-cut-thin slices of pork belly and sticks of carrot and daikon. A nest of flaky, savory “crispy pan-fried cake” is not entirely unlike Italian fried dough, finished with sesame seeds instead of powdered sugar. Little Italy may be dwindling, but in some ways the city stays the same. On a recent evening, a group of three left Beijing Pop Kabob in search of a taxi to the West Village. The driver of a stretch limo idling on the corner rolled down his window. “I’ll take you. Ten dollars,” he said. “Each.” <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner.

Amid the several remaining curry joints on that block is an unexpected gem, serving nothing curried whatsoever. The Eddy is a pretty little place with white walls, candlelight, garden-inspired dishes, and an anachronistic sense of romance.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">The food, however, is modern, and leans toward cerebral. A concise, often changing à-la-carte menu (there is also a sixty-five-dollar tasting-menu option) features bar snacks that are ingenious refinements of junk food. The chef, Brendan McHale, who once cooked at the well-regarded (now defunct) Jack’s Luxury Oyster Bar, fries beef tendon and fills it with charred-onion cream and generous dollops of trout roe. It puffs up like chicharrón, or, according to one new beef-tendon convert, like a Funyun. Bacon bits liven up regulation tater tots topped with mustard and pea purée, and apple-ginger ice turns Wellfleet oysters into ice pops: crunchy, creamy, tart, sweet. Salmon rillettes (the salmon is cured in salt and Lapsang tea, cooked in olive oil, and mixed with tarragon, dill, lemon zest, and chili pepper) come in a tiny jar alongside perfectly fried potato skins that are dusted with some crazy homemade cool-ranch-flavored powder.</p><p data-wc="147" word_count="147">For the appetizers, there’s a formula: take a dish with several strong elements and add one more. Usually that doesn’t work, but at the Eddy—with the octopus, the scallop crudo, the burrata—it does. In a town lousy with burrata, McHale’s, which is piled with super-sweet maple-glazed squash wedges, doused in an otherworldly verdant oil made of anise hyssop, and topped with pepitas, might be the best right now. The entrées can be hit-or-miss. A tea-smoked duck was too rare, and cut too thick to handle politely; the arctic char was too sweet with parsnips and sunchokes. Rib eye, oddly piled on one side of an otherwise empty plate, was satisfyingly smothered in St. Albray fondue. The best might be the vegetarian option, a plate of huge ricotta-filled gnocchi, fried in brown butter and surrounded by mushrooms, cubes of squash, and pistachios.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Here’s another formula: savvy, mannerly servers, fussy cocktails with vaguely British names and lots of citrus peel, a room quiet enough for conversation. Kelvin Uffre, the bartender who developed the cocktails—the Morgan Le Fay, the Parlor Friar II—likes to put on a show of ambidexterity, pouring two drinks at a time from up high into heavy cut glass. He does this in the small front room as it packs full of young people. It feels like a fun, fancy living-room party, and, who knows, maybe it’s somebody’s birthday. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

Rita Sodi’s tasteful standby on Christopher Street, I Sodi, is famous for its woodsy lasagna and assertive Negronis; Buvette is Jody Williams’s casual French nook one block over, perfect for midafternoon French 75s in coupes alongside little nibbles of liberally buttered toast with anchovies. Via Carota is the name of a street in a Tuscan village where Sodi once lived; it is also, now, an Italian joint in the overly cosseted confines of the West Village where you can eat lightly fried artichokes most times of the day, or order a side of beets with pickled apples and thyme, chased with a glass of tiramisu with black cherries. (The menu changes often.) No one will tell you that the kitchen prefers your entire order at once; there are no reservations, no host stand, and no corner booths for visiting oligarchs—or even for Martha Stewart, who dropped in a few days after the restaurant opened and sat with her handbag in her lap at one of the tiny zinc tables like everyone else.</p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">With freedom comes responsibility. It’s on you to create a meal from a menu of snack-size dishes which leaves you full but also satisfied, and there is no one else to blame if you order three of the crostini with the cheese that tastes like butter (it’s stracchino) and then have to waddle off to the 1 train. The menu’s a grab bag—mostly vegetables, but the dishes vary in size and tastiness. Sautéed black kale with crumbled pork sausage seemed sad without orecchiette, and a cauliflower gratin was thin and milky. The cod fritters were plentiful but not memorable, while the butter-bathed pumpkin-and-sage ravioli were fluffy, beautiful, and fleeting, an exercise in virtuosity equivalent to a concert pianist running up and down a scale very fast.</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">Plates might pile up before the table hits on a winner: one night, it was an austere Meyer-lemon risotto, each bite both crunchy and creamy. On another, it was slivers of cabbage mixed with farro, like Moosewood goes to Tuscany in its guise of health, wholesomeness, and simplicity. Via Carota lacks many of the trappings we’ve come to associate with trendy restaurants—flattering lights, bacon with the Brussels sprouts, elaborate cocktails with many ingredients. Instead, what Williams and Sodi have is confidence. Their chocolate budino is an ample smear, topped with a messy mountain of whipped mascarpone. There’s the faintest taste of orange. It’s the smoothest thing you’ll ever eat, and it would look horrible on Instagram. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="4" word_count="4"><em>Open daily.

But, in addition to those scrambled eggs—fat, delicate, custard-like curds—the breakfast taco at Greenpoint Fish &amp; Lobster Co. contains crispy fried oysters and shaved bottarga (plus pickled jalapeños and chipotle mayo), and suddenly it all makes sense. Even the fiercest brunch hater will have a hard time arguing with the weekend midday menu at Greenpoint Fish, which changes with the season and the catch. On a recent Sunday, the tacos shared billing with a hearty, house-smoked-bluefish hash topped with arugula and poached eggs; thick folds of arctic-char gravlax, strewn with capers and dill and served with a Black Seed bagel; and sweet, slippery lobes of sea urchin nestled in its spiny vessel.</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">Dinner on a Tuesday brought a shift in tone but not tenor, beginning with slices of a firm, buttery scallop, presented in its luminescent shell like Botticelli’s Venus. Plump, juicy Cape Cod mussels were ladled with a thrillingly rich green coconut curry, flecked with tiny warning signs of bright-red Thai bird chili, and served with a hunk of craggy sourdough to sop up the valuable refuse. There were dishes containing little or nothing from the sea, like an unusually generous portion of fried Brussels sprouts in buttermilk ranch and a bowl of blistered shishito peppers with bonito flakes, but why bother when you could have the peppers stuffed into the cavity of a freshly caught, crisp-skinned and sweet-fleshed whole whiting?</p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">In their mission to introduce high-quality seafood to a neighborhood redolent of pierogies and kielbasa, the shop’s proprietors, Adam Geringer-Dunn and Vinny Milburn, have covered all angles. Geringer-Dunn, a pescatarian who lives in the neighborhood and likes to cook, wanted easy access to the stuff; Milburn, his friend and former music-business associate, knew how best to procure it, as the great-great-grandson of the founder of the thriving Boston fish wholesaler John Nagle Co. There can be a wait for the twenty-odd seats along the galley kitchen, but up front, at the counter, service is speedy and the options on ice are plentiful: glistening fillets of rainbow trout and Alaskan salmon, clusters of littlenecks and oysters, quarts of fish stock. For the home cook, it’s a one-stop shop, chockablock with tools and accessories, from shrimp deveiners and soup socks to lemons, panko, dried seaweed sheets, and mango-lassi-flavored saltwater taffy. There’s even a shelf of cookbooks: “The River Cottage Fish Book,” “A Boat, a Whale, &amp; a Walrus,” “For Cod and Country.” Amen. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner.

It’s a place of modest ambition, and quiet conversation. Go with someone who loves you: the steaks come with a head of roasted garlic on the side, and there’s more in the chorizo. Early in the evening, a gentle cover of “Michelle” ends, and then the only sound is the ceiling fans, whirring in defiance of the winter outside. Acknowledging that the grape’s had a rough run, the waitress says her favorite wine is the Malbec, from Patagonia. It looks like ink, and tastes a little like it, too—rich and dark enough to conjure visions of windswept plains beneath Andean peaks. Another glass with the skirt steak, which comes with a peppery watercress salad and pleasingly flimsy fries. There’s a bright and cheery tomato-and-onion salsa, but the assertive, verdant chimichurri (more garlic) is the condiment that runs out.</p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">“There’s going to be three courses, and everything’s going to be O.K.,” says the waitress at the beginning of the meal. There are things to eat besides steak, like a blood sausage that oozes out of its casing, and velvety sweetbreads the size of healthy diver scallops. The carrots in the salad—slivers of orange, pepitas, sprigs of escarole, a daub of queso fresco—were gritty one night, but on this occasion they are roasted into creaminess. Provoleta, pulled curd provolone, like the top of a pizza or French onion soup, should be eaten with bread, but it’s too luxurious to sully with carbs. Adults need treats, too. Mushy ricotta cavatelli bob about in a tomato confit. The sauce, a thick and flavorful broth, turns out to be the point of the dish. What about the steaks themselves? You might wish that all four of the beef options were grass-fed (in fact, it’s just the strip loin), which is the Argentine way. But the all-important crust is there, as is the distinct “añejo,” or aged funk.</p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">As one meal ends at nine o’clock, many more are just beginning. The dining room fills up, and the chill brought on by the all-glass façade subsides. Two men in sharp suits take up residence at the tiny bar in the back of the room, murmuring in Spanish and drinking something amber-colored that suggests fortified wine. A flan appears, quivering alongside a puddle of dulce de leche. The ceiling fans are still going, but there is now a hubbub in the room. The caramel is gummy and delicious and sticks to forks and teeth. The waitress was right. Everything is going to be O.K. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

La Savane, in Harlem, is not only recommended by taxi drivers from West Africa, it’s also owned by two of them (one from Côte d’Ivoire, the other from Guinea), though they’ve given up their cabs since getting into the restaurant business, two years ago. On a recent Friday evening, a diner from Nigeria by way of Senegal greeted his waitress, who, he’d ascertained, hailed from Burkina Faso. “<em>Bonsoir</em>, my Burkina <em>chérie</em>! What kind of food do they serve here?” “Ivorian,” she responded flatly. “But, is it also Senegalese?” he asked. She gave him a look. “It’s like Senegalese, but better.”</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">In truth, La Savane offers a kind of pan-African cuisine, thanks to a rotation of women from Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, and even Senegal who have overseen the kitchen. But the murals on the wall—of thatched-roofed huts and villagers tending a giant cauldron—were painted by an artist from Côte d’Ivoire, and some dishes represent that country distinctly. A table was divided into those who liked the <em>foutou,</em> which is sometimes called the national dish of Côte d’Ivoire, and those who did not. Made from plantains—boiled, salted, and pounded, then molded into an orb—it resembles a loaf of unbaked bread, with the same dense elasticity. It’s best eaten in hand-torn pieces and dipped into a stew, such as La Savane’s exceedingly gelatinous mixture of finely chopped okra, tomato, and chili peppers, bobbing with turkey meat, cow feet, and lamb bones—on which the table was similarly divided.</p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">For pleasing a crowd, there are plenty of other options: tender, rosy-fleshed lamb shanks with an almost chicken-fried exterior; a whole guinea fowl, split and deep-fried to an optimal golden hue; bony chunks of agreeably oily grilled lamb, blanketed in barely softened onions. Most everything comes scattered with a mustardy mix of chopped tomatoes, onion, and peppers, and with a tiny plastic container of devastatingly spicy Ivorian hot sauce. To cool the palate, there are glossy half-moons of sweet plantain or Ivorian <em>attiéké</em>, which looks, feels, and tastes like couscous but is made from grated fermented cassava pulp and comes with a foil-wrapped Maggi bouillon cube, to be crumbled and mixed in like salt.</p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">La Savane lacks many of the usual trappings of a Manhattan restaurant: knives (there are forks and spoons, though some diners eat with their hands), share plates, tap water (there is bottled Poland Spring). On a busy Friday night, it can feel more like a social club, as West Africans from all over the city pack in around the cramped tables, chatting in a mix of French and English and ordering without a glance at the menu. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

A string of Nawabs governed from the seventeen-twenties to the mid-eighteen-hundreds, barely holding off British annexation. They were famous for their decadence, inclined to indulge in dancing girls and lavish feasts, known as <em>dastarkhwan:</em> tapestries of kebabs, biryanis, and curries. On Manhattan’s Upper West Side, in an area whose residents have learned to rely on Teflon standbys, Gaurav Anand (the chef-owner of Moti Mahal Delux, on the Upper East Side) has opened a paean to the prodigious cuisine of Awadh.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">A disco-mirrored Buddha and eighties-era details, like dark slatted wood and glass-ball chandeliers, belie the refinement of the food. Anand travelled to Lucknow, Awadh’s capital, to learn the centuries-old technique of <em>dum pukht</em>, which he employs to handsome effect in the deceptively simple-looking appetizer Awadh Murgh Tikka. Steamed cubes of chicken are marinated in pomegranate powder, chickpea flour, and yogurt, then sealed in a heavy-bottomed pan and heated over a low flame, so that the meat cooks in its own juices. It’s extremely tender, and is finished on the grill for a bit of charred crunchiness on the corners. The Galouti kebab comes as creamy-crisp disks of pounded minced lamb, which arrive atop miniature paratha. Garnished with cilantro chutney, they’re like little Indian tacos.</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">That old favorite chicken tikka masala is nowhere in sight, but there’s a nice Tariwala chicken, swimming in a thick sauce of coconut milk, curry leaves, cardamom, star anise, and poppy seeds. (The exemplary paneer tikka masala, with house-made cheese, highlights how mellow that tomato-cream sauce can be.) One night, a shrimp curry came with three jumbo specimens in a bright coconut-milk-tomato sauce, which, in spite of being lovely, couldn’t hide the fact that the shrimp tasted like they were raised in a tank. The lobster, though, was fit for a queen—a pretty red tail shell filled with large chunks coated in cashew sauce, saffron, and jaggery, rich and sweet like a pan roast. But the biggest payoff came for those who did not fear the baby goat. Delicate, mild, and tender, the goat Dahiwala finished with a subtle, sneaking heat from green chilis and garam masala.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">It’s fun to eat like a Nawab, amid the Upper West Siders complaining that the print on the <em>Times</em>’ Web site is too small, discussing “Breaking Bad” and “High Maintenance.” The hardworking waitstaff are quietly patient and nearly telepathic with their courtesies. At the end of such an extravagant meal, it’s hard not to feel as if one has imbibed a pound of melted butter and a quart of cream. But, as you may have heard, the medical establishment now says that butter is good for you, or, at least, not bad for you. We concur. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner.

Not the buttermilk-crusted crags and crevices of the South but the Korean variety: smooth, with a slight shimmer, resembling a lunar landscape, or at least what the moon looks like from Earth. Amid a crowded field in the shadow of the Empire State Building, there’s a particularly fine rendition of Korean fried chicken at the lavishly named Turntable Retro Bar &amp; Restaurant Mad for Chicken, part of a mini-chain that originated in Flushing. Like many of Koreatown’s best establishments, it’s on the second floor of a bleak office building. After eight, a d.j. in a glass booth makes his presence known, loudly, to all the restaurant’s customers, many of whom have enthusiastically embraced the truth that fried chicken is a drunk food par excellence.</p><p data-wc="133" word_count="133">If that’s the route you’d like to take, do not let the long list of signature Martinis distract you. One of them—the Earl Gray Twist—comes with a Mighty Leaf teabag awkwardly dangling off the side; another, the Blueberry Martini, lists sour mix as an ingredient. When the most drinkable of the cocktails is made with Cognac (Men in Cognac, which sounds like a misandrist’s excellent revenge plot), it’s an indicator that soju or beer is best. There are plenty of other things to avoid, too: undercooked kimchi pancakes, a “Mexican-style” appetizer of mozzarella-covered corn, tables of men with rolled-up shirtsleeves ordering shots and talking about a bungee-jumping video they posted on Facebook. And although the menu has all the Korean dishes Americans might expect, none are exceptional.</p><p data-wc="208" word_count="208">After everyone’s poked their chopsticks around in a dish of reliably chewy rice cakes with bulgogi, the chicken is eaten swiftly and in silence—or as quietly as possible when it’s oldies night and the d.j.’s got to the sotto-voce part of “Total Eclipse of the Heart.” There are many reasons why Korean fried chicken is such a superbly satisfying eating experience. Fingers aren’t spoiled, because the sauce is lightly brushed on, and only after the chicken is cooked. The meat remains juicy, because the bird is cooked at a lower temperature than its American brethren. The chicken is dipped in a very finely ground flour, and, as a result, the shell is paper-thin, almost translucent; it is pierced, not shattered, on first bite. Because the skin and flesh are cooked evenly, the disconcerting layer of fat in between is exorcised. Although Turntable offers a soy-and-garlic sauce, the hot and spicy is the main event, with a slow and subtle burn. A plate of wings with a side of pickled daikon radish is the ideal mix of salty and sour, crunchy and chewy. Human tastebuds are powerless against such a deeply addictive sequence. All there is to do is add soju, and repeat. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner.

Shun Lee West—the beloved Lincoln Center standby owned by Michael Tong, an early purveyor of “haute Chinese food”—underwent a renovation recently, shifting its color scheme from black, gold, and white to black, gold, and red, with new paint, carpeting, and napkins (still tucked into wineglasses, wedding-banquet style). The menu has been updated to include a gluten-free section (Chicken Soong in Lettuce Wrap, Heavenly Fish Filet). Otherwise, it doesn’t feel very different from the way it was in the nineteen-eighties, when it opened: charmingly terrifying, fire-eyed alabaster monkeys hanging from the bar and around the host stand; majestic, glowing dragons circling the high-backed booths in the two-tiered dining room; seasoned, unflappable waiters in vests and ties.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">If there’s never been a better time to eat Chinese food in New York, there’s never been a worse time to eat at Shun Lee, where the menu harks back to an era when Chinese restaurants pandered to timid American palates, and the prices are absurdly high. But there’s something deeply comforting about starting a meal with Shun Lee’s greasy, blistered version of the kind of crispy noodles that come in a wax-paper bag with Chinese takeout, dipped in little bowls of duck sauce and astringently hot mustard. And where else can you see largely bygone “Old Favorites” like egg foo yung and chicken chow mein so proudly displayed?</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">Dishes with elegantly metaphorical names—Lily in the Wood, Ants Climb on Trees—smack of a more poetic era. On a recent evening, the Lily in the Wood was a grave disappointment, consisting of still-gritty steamed bok-choy hearts overlaid with tough, chewy shiitakes and drizzled with an aggressively bland, clear sauce. But the Ants Climb on Trees was a clever delight, slippery tangles of beef-flecked cellophane noodles resting atop crisp stalks of Chinese broccoli. Serviceable Shanghai Soupy Dumplings were elevated by the convenience of their presentation, each delivered in its own ceramic spoon. With a little nudging, a waiter was convinced to recommend an off-menu dish: glazed, red-cooked pork-belly Tung-Por, named, he said, after a Song-dynasty poet. It was succulent and sweet, unlike a dish of rather difficult to eat short ribs stewed in soy and rock candy, whose description declared, “It is authentic.”</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">As is true of so many of the city’s lasting establishments, Shun Lee hasn’t stayed open on the basis of its long-surpassed culinary merits. But here your waiter will arrange your dishes on a small folding stand next to your table, then portion them out for each person in your party, with plenty of time to make it to the opera or the ballet. Shun Lee is just like you remember it. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner.

Down the drab end of Park Avenue, though, Justin Smillie is filling a lesser-known gap in the city’s offerings of Californian cuisine. Upland, named for the town in which Smillie grew up, is a retreat from the beach to the badlands at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, with a menu of teeming pizzas and robust meat dishes.</p><p data-wc="209" word_count="209">The restaurant opened in late October, and on some early visits enthusiasm trumped detail: a chilled sea-urchin spaghetti was an “homage to Chef’s favorite East Village restaurant,” though no one could remember which one. Sadly, the lemon in the creamy sauce wasn’t as elusive, and wading through the thickly coated farro noodles for a few globs of sea urchin was an exercise against the clock, before the sauce coagulated entirely. Mostly, though, there’s payoff to those big, straightforward flavors: the only quotation marks on the menu, thank goodness, are around “Caesar,” and they’re not even needed, because the garlic-anchovy dressing on the salad was spot on, an invigorating saline embrace to which even the heartiest lettuces can only succumb. There’s an exuberance, too, to the pork-chop dish, served with its crackling skin intact, in a plating that resembles a Dutch still-life: crescents of ripe, roasted persimmons; long, charred slivers of spring onion; and bright-red fingers of Jimmy Nardello peppers, a sweet heirloom variety, rarely found outside California. Fruit with pork isn’t new, but persimmons make for an especially juicy combination, and it’s one of those rare occasions when an entrée trumps the easy, cheesy thrills of the appetizers that came before.</p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">Not that those don’t exist in abundance: the pizza section of the menu caters to after-work happy-hour gatherings, those great six o’clock stampedes of the Flatiron district’s relatively cavernous spaces which for a moment each day make it feel like D.C. The happy crowds are already flocking to the equally cheery bar area of Upland, for rejiggered mint juleps made from mezcal, an unusually fragrant Italian sour, and a bourbon cocktail finished with shaved nutmeg that tickles the nose. Given these persuasively boozy creations, the pizzas are much better than they need to be: blistered and chewy, with almost oddball toppings, like walnut pesto, shiso, and straciatella. Most of the drinkers don’t move into the brasserie-like dining area, where preserving jars filled with artichokes and lemons glow amber, and diners must roll up their sleeves to engage with the messy but memorable bucatini alla carbonara. There’s an irresponsible amount of pancetta sprinkled on top of the porky sauce. What does it have to do with California? Who cares. Authenticity’s got no chance against bacon bits. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

It’s hard to think of a classier opening: ornate crystal chandeliers, velvet emerald drapes, black tufted-leather banquettes, and low lighting for a moody “Godfather” glow. What a glorious setting for the food of Floyd Cardoz, who was the chef at the beloved Danny Meyer-owned Indian restaurant Tabla for twelve years, and then, for a few years, at Meyer’s North End Grill. Now Cardoz, who amicably parted ways with Meyer, has joined forces with a group of investors that includes the “Nightline” host Dan Abrams and David Zinczenko, an author of life-style books such as “The Abs Diet for Women.”</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">At White Street, several solicitous young hostesses bustle about, managing to make short skirts, very high heels, and even lamé appear tasteful. They cheerfully encourage a stop in the lounge, where a concise list of subtle cocktails, with names like Dorsey and Garland, features the requisite two strange ingredients per drink: fennel syrup, candied lavender crumble, sarsaparilla-kumquat rye. The dinner menu includes bistro classics and luxurious special-occasion dishes, each with its own unique ethnic flavor profile—Indian, Japanese, upstate New York—making it difficult to decide which way to go. Pretty much everything is good. Roasted quail with tangy cider-braised skin nullified the usual annoyance of carving the tiny bird, and the bacon-and-mustard-infused barley stuffed inside it was rich and delicious, sensations not usually associated with cereal grains. Raw Long Island fluke with wasabi-tamari broth poured over it was called ceviche, but it was more like an earthy Japanese tartare.</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">Missteps are rare, making them noticeable. One night, a special of gooseneck barnacles was described by a proud server as “an amalgamation of every seafood you’ve ever tasted: lobster, shrimp, scallops—very delicate.” “Are the barnacles, like, from a ship?” one diner asked. “No, a rock,” the server said. When they arrived, they were so tiny, and so hard to procure from their shells, even after a lengthy tutorial, that they were deemed a disaster. (For the record, they look and taste rather like the sock-shaped appendages on steamer clams.)</p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">The seared lamb cannon with cumin and mint was juicy and pink, the edges crispy, and the short ribs, over horseradish grits and topped with fried shoestring potatoes, were both comforting and refined. When you read “spiced fries, duck fat, homemade mayonnaise,” you know what to do. But Cardoz is still most engaging when he veers toward Indian flavors, as in the perfectly balanced curry sauce that came with those sad little barnacles, and the piri-piri-chili-spiked broth in the White Street bouillabaisse, full of clams, shrimp, and swordfish.

For now, they’re instantly familiar as the headline of a ubiquitous flyer, posted on bulletin boards across the city for the past twenty years, advertising music lessons with a suspiciously ordinary-looking man. At King Bee, a new restaurant in the East Village, they’re also the name of a cocktail, a kicky mix of Cocchi Americano Rosa and a particularly vinegary plum shrub, served on the rocks with a wedge of lemon. The drink is unusual enough that it doesn’t need a gimmick, but this feels like an act of cultural preservation—the de-facto theme of King Bee, whose Web site describes it as “inspired by the Acadian culinary tradition.”</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">“Acadian” is a word that you may have trouble defining, unless you’ve spent time in the Canadian Maritimes, where the French colony known as Acadia was established in the seventeenth century, or in Louisiana, where many Acadians settled after they were expelled by the British, a century later. (It was there that the word morphed into “Cajun.”) After trips to Newfoundland and the Bayou, the King Bee co-owners Eben Klemm (a molecular biologist turned beverage consultant) and Ken Jackson (an original partner in the New Orleans restaurant Herbsaint) came up with a menu that represents both places, then refined it with the chef Jeremie Tomczak, who worked for Marcus Samuelsson at Aquavit and the Red Rooster.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Just when it seemed like pork belly was passé, Tomczak has given it new life, chopping it into bite-size cubes for cracklings, which are deep fried and coated in cane-sugar caramel, crushed peanuts, and powdered malt vinegar. Spilling out of a paper bag and dressed with dainty sprigs of thyme, they’re as irresistible as the best French fries and as sweet and sticky as taffy. Cracklings sound like pure Louisiana, but they’re also a specialty of Newfoundland, where they’re called scrunchions, and often served over cod. Pure Maritimes are the traditional boiled potato dumplings known as <em>poutine rapeé</em>, here beautifully seared and filled with lamb neck rather than salt pork.</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">Marbled slices of prosciutto-like country ham come from Tennessee, Jackson’s home state. What’s more important is what they come with: crisp slices of barely pickled squash, a winning foil in both flavor and texture, especially slathered in grain-mustard crème fraîche and eaten atop good, crusty bread. Bread appears again as a juice-absorbing pedestal for an excellent rib eye, drizzled with beef vinaigrette, and yet again in little shards beneath a plump half chicken with yellow wax beans and salted greens. From North to South, it’s convincing country food, all the way down to the pecan pie and the <em>gâteau de sirop</em>, served from an antique sideboard in the back of the dining room. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open for dinner Wednesdays through Mondays.

Plenty do; the “new style” preparation, a way of partially cooking the fish that Nobu Matsushisa invented in the late eighties to placate a squeamish customer in Los Angeles, is now served at thirty eponymous locations around the world. At the branch in Doha, opening soon, Arabian Gulf fish such as black-streaked monocle bream and orange-spotted trevally will get the same Nobu treatment, with yuzu, garlic, and soy sauce topping off the scalding sesame and olive oils.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">Twenty years in at the original location, on Hudson Street, the fish of the moment is fluke. Not that you’ll taste it much, beyond its accoutrements. Like the rest of the entry-level omakase menu, the flavors are in line with the room: loud. Designing a menu around what people in Hollywood like to eat has brought Matsushisa tremendous success, and a handful of his creations have become so well known they approach cliché. The idea of garnishing yellowtail with jalapeño? That was Matsushisa’s, from time he spent in South America before coming to the U.S. Sashimi salad? His. But we ask more of our vegetables these days, and although the salad’s onion-soy dressing is zippy, it obliterates the mixed greens, which have the suspicious wilt of the plastic-clamshell variety.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">The most popular dish, and inspiration for countless misguided Seamless orders, remains the sensational black-cod miso. The sake-infused sauce teeters on the edge of cloying, but, unlike the wasabi marinade on a toro tartare, which is so assertive it catches in the throat, the over-all effect is creamy and smooth. Rock-shrimp tempura is “popcorn fried” and served with a very eggy aïoli. It would make a wonderful snack at a baseball game. (Don’t look now, but here’s the meal’s second vegetable: a crisp red-cabbage leaf, which acts as a bed for the fry detritus.)</p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">These are big tastes—rich and sweet in equal measure—which are now familiar, even obvious, but if anyone tells you they had a bad time at Nobu New York, they’re lying. It’s not an unpleasant experience, to feel like a time traveller to the Clinton years, surrounded by irresistible totems of the era: molten-chocolate cake, long-haired male models, lychee Martinis. The David Rockwell-designed interior was conceived as a journey through a forest, and somehow even our understanding of what that might be seems to have changed—the giant Japanese slippers on the walls, intended to continue the theme of walking through nature and replicated at Nobus globally, look a little like ironing boards. “Tall fake birches and tall fake blondes” is how this magazine described the décor at the restaurant’s opening. Both are still in attendance, and the clubhouse atmosphere is probably a big part of Nobu’s enduring appeal—along with the fact that if you don’t like raw fish, you can still have sashimi. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for dinner.

Regional styles have long been kept at bay, but the big floppy slice and the Lombardi’s and John’s <!--span id="incorrect">wood-fired</span>--><span id="correct">coal-fired</span><a href="#editorsnote" id="correctionasterisk">*</a> pies have lately had to compete with a wave of puffball Neapolitan darlings and their topnotch mozzarella. Now there’s a new game in town: Chicago deep dish. Last year, Emmett Burke, who grew up in the Chicago suburb Lake Forest and went to college at Fordham, opened the first New York restaurant to ardently concentrate on the notoriously over-the-top stuffed pizza.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">Crowds swarmed. Yelpers judged (“tasted worse than Play-Doh”). Threatened New Yorkers made fun: Jon Stewart dedicated long swear-filled rants on “The Daily Show” to upbraiding Chicago’s “casserole” passing for pizza. Chicago’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, sent Stewart a deep-dish pie, which he fed to a dog, who sniffed it and turned away. The extended bit ended in a truce, when Stewart tasted a slice of the Chicago restaurant Lou Malnati’s deep dish on air, and admitted it was delicious. New York pride aside, the reaction to Emmett’s was split: (1) You call this Chicago pizza? and (2) Thank God you have arrived (because Uno franchises do not count).</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Taking a few years off from Wall Street to tinker with a recipe he came up with himself, Burke has devised a very savvy replica of the real thing. The crust, with a two-inch edge, is layered first with mozzarella, then toppings—the excellent spicy, fennel-seed-inflected sausage and peppers, onions, and mushrooms are a classic combo. A superbly rich reduced tomato sauce is ladled on top, and it’s all cooked in a cast-iron pan, which is delivered by the waitress with a valiant hoist. While Emmett’s crust has a good crunch, it’s a tad dry, and doesn’t have the sparkly flavor or the sweet olive-oil caramelization of the best Chicago purveyors (which are, basically, the original Uno’s, Due’s, Gino’s, and any branch of Lou Malnati’s). Still, the cheese is tangy, salty, and oozy enough to carry you through to the next time you get to have Chicago pizza.</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">Amazingly, Emmett’s is charging Wicker Park prices in a prime SoHo location. The small, cozy room has an unassumingly charming dive-bar atmosphere, complete with rusted Pepsi sign and light-up car bumper, as if we were back in Schaumburg. There’s a vast, astute selection of beer and wine and an excellent thirteen-dollar bar burger, with a hefty charred flavor, good cheddar, and a squishy potato bun. The crowds have died down somewhat, and Burke can often be found working the bar and answering the phone. He seems a little shell-shocked by the response, but has nonetheless just expanded his menu, with Chicago thin-crust pizza, an underappreciated gem. A large round cut into squares has a thorough covering of toppings and a crisp bottom that seems as though it came out of a toaster oven. It’s a spot-on execution of another genius food. New Yorkers should feel no shame. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="14" word_count="14"><em>Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for lunch and dinner.

They moved to Brooklyn in the late eighties and in 2006 opened their first restaurant, Korzo, in Park Slope. It was followed by a second location, in the East Village, and the Korzos became known on food blogs for a deep-fried burger, involving a medium-rare grass-fed-beef patty wrapped in<em> lángos</em>, a slightly sweet Hungarian pastry dough made from Maria’s family recipe. It’s hard to think of a more compelling argument for multiculturalism than this hybrid, which features the ideal ratio of bun to meat, and is so easy to eat, because the frying forms a seal on the juices.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">The Zizaks have now opened a third place, in Bay Ridge, which serves the burger, as well as the carefully prepared Central European food of their other two locations, but with an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Rooftop gardens are little more than a gimmick for many downtown-Manhattan establishments, but the ingredients gathered from the top of the Brooklyn Beet Company building, for some of the dishes—juicy, quick-pickled dill cucumbers in late summer, as well as a superb delicata-squash soup—are used to convincing effect. Sausages are cured in-house, and Otto makes a small range of condiments, the best of which is a beet ketchup. The sweetness of the beets is subtle, and an improvement on the high-fructose corn syrup used in conventional varieties. Slathering the sauce on the burger, which comes with a radish salad in a show of temperance, is advised.</p><p data-wc="236" word_count="236">Maria is the executive chef, and she makes unconventional yet generally successful decisions in tweaking traditional dishes. There are raisins and chunks of apple in the latkes, which can be ordered with sautéed vegetables on top (mushrooms, carrots, onions), but the fruity pancakes go better with the pulled pork. Pierogis are made with turnip and squash baked into the dough; like all of the world’s most effective comfort foods, they are chewy enough to be a challenge. <em>Halušky</em>, the region’s thick, soft noodles, come in what a waiter described as a “Slovak mac and cheese,” made with a sheep’s-milk cheese called <em>bryndza</em>. Is the dish too much once the uncured house-made brat has been added to the mix? And also some apple-smoked pork belly? Possibly, but it’s not winter yet, and there’s a coherence to the mushiness of it all. It’s better to pair this kind of heavy meal with the crisp, hoppy Korzo organic ale, made in partnership with Peak Organic, than with the “beet-tini,” which has a violent red color and a vinegary taste. It’s admirable, though, that even the cocktails exhibit a strong point of view—indicative of a restaurant run by people who care about creating an experience as interesting as it is relaxing. For some, a meal might wind up as three courses of perfectly fried dough, in various guises.

Yet the more effort expended—dim lights, deep booths, a Web site featuring splayed chicken legs—the less alluring the whole thing becomes. That’s what we’re always being told by the French, anyhow, and it’s the biggest problem with this new venture from the Torrisi team, who are referred to as “boys” in the food press and have built an empire on theatrically presented and audaciously priced red-sauce favorites, at Carbone and Parm.</p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">Dirty French, which is in the Ludlow Hotel, is the boys’ first move away from Italian food. They’ve hedged their bets, though; light-bulb-lined mirrors and frisée aux lardons aside, this is not meant to be a traditional Parisian bistro. Much is made of North African and Creole influences, although these usually end up being inconsequential. On a recent evening, the amandine clams were roasted with berbere spices, but the abundance of melted brown butter was the reason they tasted good. The salmon maison, somehow both charred and raw, came out cold. It was topped with “blackening spices,” which amounted to pink peppercorns. Dill predominated, as it tends to do.</p><p data-wc="196" word_count="196">Another overpowering element that night: the group in the booth next door, who at one point filmed themselves on their phones singing along to “Papa Don’t Preach.” (The restaurant plays exclusively eighties music.) With everyone determined to have a wild time, it felt a little like Vegas. A dramatic presentation of oysters on ice appeared at the table for perusal. It seemed rude to turn them down, or to ask how much they cost. The côte de boeuf, one of two entrées “pour deux,” was “a hundred and twenty-five to two hundred and fifty dollars,” depending on how much romance you wanted and how many pounds you could eat. The other shared entrée was chicken and crêpes, and a waiter who had obviously grown accustomed to serving precision-minded finance types estimated that “thirty-five to forty per cent” of diners the previous night had ordered it. There was so much involved with the chicken that the service spread over onto an adjoining table: a few different sauces, the best of which was an apricot-tamarind; roasted breast with vegetables; a serviceable thigh, finished on the grill; and the crêpes themselves, dismayingly leaden.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">“ ‘Awesome’ is such a stupid word,” the waiter said, but he did think it applied to the beignets. Like everything else at Dirty French, they were enormous—each the size of an iPhone Plus, and too big to dip into the ramekin of caramel sauce served alongside. It was impossible to eat them without getting powdered sugar everywhere, but it didn’t matter. The lights were going down, and the music was getting louder. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

Cards on the market’s communal tables advertised apartments in the building (they didn’t mention prices, but the average rental is five thousand dollars). As the sun set over the glowing-orange Manhattan Mini Storage on the other side of the street, a cheerful young woman in a branded T-shirt pulled down a projector screen to show episodes of “Star Trek,” while two ten-year-olds brawled in the corner. The concrete floors made this all seem even louder than it actually was.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">That’s what’s wrong with the place, but here’s what’s right: just about all of the eight venders are at the peak of food-world buzziness, and, most of the time, their outposts live up to the hype. Ivan Orkin, born in Syosset, with the chutzpah to sell ramen in Tokyo, has opened Slurp Shop, a New York branch of his noodles empire. That night’s special, a chilled-lemon <em>shio</em>, was refreshing and hearty at the same time—Orkin’s signature rye-flecked noodles seemed extra-glutinous and chewy, and they swam in a lemon-dashi broth that tasted like a summer’s day.</p><p data-wc="57" word_count="57">At El Colmado, a tapas bar created by Seamus Mullen, of the West Village’s Tertulia, most groups had an order of the devilled eggs, smoky from whipped <em>bacalao</em>. There would be no fights over the crispiest bits of <em>patatas bravas</em>, because they were served on an unusually generous platter, and were of a consistently golden hue.</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">Ex-suburbanites delighted in the buzzer system at Genuine Roadside, a resolutely unpretentious joint from AvroKO, the restaurant-branding team that popularized the Edison-light-bulb aesthetic. There were no trendy light fixtures here, but there was a buttermilk-battered-chicken sandwich with apple-celeriac slaw and sambal mayo, served on the sort of soft potato roll that you can squish as flat as a pancake. It was crunchy and coherent—exactly what refined fast food should taste like. The same went for the double-stack burger, made with a Shake Shack-like blend of eighty per cent chuck and twenty per cent hanger, served with American cheese, sweet pickles, and the requisite pale-pink “house sauce.” The meal was nostalgic, as though in a high-school cafeteria, ending with the bussing of trays, the sorting of trash, and a treat to go—sweet-corn-and-black-raspberry ice cream, from the city’s only outpost of Jeni’s, the Midwestern dessert phenomenon. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily, 7<small>A.M.</small>-11<small>P.M.</small></em></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/sandbox/tables-for-two/"><em>View more restaurants in our Tables for Two map</em></a>.</p>

The success of this melting-pot model varies, but in Red Hook a Brooklyn native named Billy Durney has nailed a formula: mostly Texas, a touch of North Carolina and Kansas City, but very Brooklyn.</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">Durney started out by experimenting with a smoker at his South Park Slope apartment, as a way to relieve the stress of his job as “executive protection” (read: bodyguard) to “A-list celebrities” (whose identities he won’t reveal). Travelling through South America, he was inspired by the practice of cooking whole animals over fire pits on the beach, and a visit to Louie Mueller Barbecue, in Taylor, Texas, he said, “kinda changed my life.” A year ago, after a Hurricane Sandy setback, he opened Hometown in a garage converted to resemble a Texas dance hall, with exposed wooden rafters and an enormous American flag painted on a wall. In one room, twangy bands with names like the Sometime Boys perform on a small stage; in the other, patrons line up to order meat by the half pound, served in piles on butcher-paper-lined metal trays, along with sides in paper cups.</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">You could make a meal out of poultry (the smoked turkey is moist and flavorful, with a peppercorn crust), or pork (the jerk baby backs are almost <em>char siu</em>-like, scattered with green onions), or even lamb belly, which can be ordered alone or as a banh mi. But Durney’s beef is the greatest testament to his skill: he seasons it with just salt and pepper, then cooks it in a carefully controlled environment for fifteen hours overnight, tending oak fires out on Valentino Pier, three blocks away. The brisket is superlative but almost Puritan compared to the gigantic bone-on beef rib, its layers of rendered fat and fall-apart meat encrusted in a hard to achieve, intensely peppery yet sweet black bark, known in Texas as the “sugar cookie.”</p><p data-wc="71" word_count="71">There are sauces if you need them (you don’t): hot and sweet, Kansas City-style sticky, vinegary Carolina pepper. Creamy mac and cheese gets an extra drizzle of Velveeta-colored queso, collards are strewn with pulled pork, and spicy baked beans contain tender chunks of burnt-end brisket. Between the sugar cookie and the cakelike corn bread, dessert seems negligible, but banana-cream pudding, topped with crumbled Nilla Wafers, makes a perfect palate cleanser. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="16" word_count="16"><em>Smoked meats $8-$14 per half pound, sides $3-$8.

And those people who swore not only that carob tasted just like chocolate but also that it was better for you? In the seventies, there was a certain kind of restaurant, usually vegetarian—which had its epicenter at Moosewood, in Ithaca, New York, or somewhere on the Pearl Street Mall, in Boulder, Colorado—that gloatingly served “health food.” These hippie outposts abounded with wood tones, ferns, loving sentiment, and sprouts. They didn’t really care about presentation or what was trendy, but they did believe in the healing power of the legume. Most of those quaint, outmoded places have gone the way of Jerry Garcia, replaced by the juggernaut that is the Whole Foods salad bar, as well as a new kind of health-food café. Dimes, located in an unlikely pocket of Chinatown, is such a place: bright, stylish, California-tinged, with handmade salt scrub for sale, catering to moneyed vegans and their friends.</p><p data-wc="206" word_count="206">Breakfast, when the tiny, whitewashed corridor has a brisk turnover, is lovely. But are we ready for açaí bowls? Brazilians have been eating them for decades; proximity to the South American palm trees from which the berries come makes them a cheap option. Americans brought up on Frosted Flakes and Toaster Strudel have been slow to catch up, and Dimes wisely mixes the açaí with lots of nuts and berries we <em>have</em> heard of, to make a sort of açaí sundae—in one of four versions, the frozen berry pulp is blended with house-made almond milk to make something like sorbet, which is sprinkled with bee pollen and topped with strawberries, bananas, and goji-berry granola. Of course, there’s also fresh juice, cayenne lemonade, and a pH tonic (apple-cider vinegar, lemon, honey, and chlorella, a kind of algae), and the breakfast tacos nod admiringly to Santa Monica, with soft scrambled eggs, avocado, peach salsa, and house-made hot sauce. Because Dimes is run by reasonable people—the co-owners, Sabrina De Sousa and Alissa Wagner, met while working at Lovely Day, in Nolita—who recognize that some patrons subsist on more than nuts and berries, there’s also thick-cut bacon and juicy, brightly spiced sausage.</p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">Dinner, when the lights are dimmed and the yuzu-sake and dandelion-wine cocktails are flowing, is more problematic. It’s hard to love a plate made up of two tablespoons each of eight kinds of vegetables and grains, even if it’s pulled together with a little grapefruit-ginger-ponzu sauce. Appetizers fare better, like an inspired salad of seared peaches and shishito peppers or a fine chicken-liver mousse. But it doesn’t matter, because Dimes is where the cool kids want to be, discussing Bushwick apartments or their latest love affair or the purpose of Instagram. Right now, one of those kids might be enjoying a carob-açaí bowl, which is like a muted chocolate-powder-flavored pudding, with bananas, dates, cinnamon, and coconut. There are seven kinds of food in that bowl, all of which have been on this earth for millennia. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="16" word_count="16"><em>Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

These days, there’s a small-batch coffee roaster, an exercise studio specializing in the Lagree Fitness Method, and a “unique retail concept” called Space Ninety 8. The latter, brought to you by Urban Outfitters, that bastion of commodified early-aughts hipsterdom, features the company’s “reworked vintage” line, plus a rotating array of pop-up shops (Forage Haberdashery, Stolen Girlfriends Club) and the Gorbals, an East Coast outpost of the Los Angeles restaurant that Ilan Hall, of “Top Chef” fame, opened in 2009.</p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">In a cagelike mezzanine overlooking displays of distressed denim and handcrafted deerskin medicine bags, the Gorbals gives off the vibe of a converted Bushwick warehouse, circa 2005; the flimsy floorboards trembled in time with the bass thumping from an event below. As diners studied the menu, divided into “Portlandia”-esque categories—Field, Barn, Stream, Coop—an endearingly earnest server, hands clasped, offered tips: “Talk amongst yourselves”; “I don’t like to usurp anyone’s natural interests”; “Both the chef and myself like to promote sharing.”</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">When it comes to the whole roasted pig’s head, sharing becomes more of a mandate—although the server allowed, “I watched a man eat the whole thing himself the other night. He was hammered. He was kind of bridge-and-tunnel. I can say that, ’cause I’m from Long Island.” Hall is also from Long Island, Great Neck, where he grew up eating the traditional Jewish food that he now seems to take pleasure in subverting with pork: the crackly-skinned pig’s head sometimes comes with thick, charred tortillas made from matzo meal, and matzo balls wrapped in bacon are reminiscent of Scotch eggs, which is fitting, considering Hall’s Scottish heritage. (The Gorbals is the name of a once Jewish area of Glasgow.)</p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">Out of soup, the matzo balls were a shade too wet, and some will find the carve-it-yourself pig’s head hard to grapple with, both literally and figuratively. But, as much as the Gorbals can feel like a parody of itself, a lot of Hall’s food is seriously good. Broccoli was deep-fried to a delicate, candylike texture and saturated with sweet soy and vinegar. Thrice-cooked thick-cut fries were bathed in hoisin gravy and tangled with Vietnamese pickles, sriracha, and shreds of pulled pork for the superb banh-mi poutine. A tender leg of wood-grilled rabbit came nestled in microgreens and tart, juicy vinegar-cured cherries.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">The brownie with Vidalia caramel and candied onions is about as weird as it sounds, and better, the pungent astringency of the onions playing nicely off the creamy richness of the chocolate. By dessert, the bass had died down. On the roof deck, men in graphic tank tops milled about the bar. Hall sat at a picnic table, not watching his newest reality show, “Knife Fight,” which was being projected onto a brick wall. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="6" word_count="6"><em>Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/15/wizards-oz	Wizards from Oz	The Musket Room, 265 Elizabeth St. 	null	null	null	2014/09/15	<p data-wc="119" word_count="119">The greatest misconception of antipodean food is that Vegemite, a spread made from leftover brewer’s yeast, tastes bad. It doesn’t; you’re just doing it wrong. (It should be scraped, not schmeared, and it is best understood as a delivery mechanism for butter.) Another is that there is no such thing as modern Australian or New Zealand food. There are now plenty of places to grab an Australian-inflected coffee; in some parts of town, the flat white threatens its frothier cousin, the latte. But two new restaurants make a convincing argument for something bigger: a coherent regional cuisine, drawing on the countries’ colonial past and overlaying it with the southern European and Asian influences of postwar migration.</p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">You could eat the six-course tasting menu at the Musket Room, in Nolita, without realizing that the chef, Matt Lambert, intended it as homage to his home country of New Zealand. Lambert’s art is in showing, not telling, as in a dish of cold scallops hidden under a silver cloche, to capture the smell of the manuka wood chips with which they were smoked. It’s a comforting aroma for those who know the tree, which is native to New Zealand, and, for those who don’t, a briefly transporting experience. The scallops are from Maine, but the venison, a standout entrée, is from New Zealand. It’s pleasingly sinewy and chewy, and tastes like the deer got to really roam some vast verdant fields. There’s a nicely astringent flavor, too, because the filet is cooked in gin.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">On a recent evening, the bar was packed by eight o’ clock, and a cluster of young women in wrap dresses kept ordering boulevardiers. The drinks were barrel-aged, of course, because the Musket Room takes everything seriously. The expat-nostalgia factor seemed low; not so at Flinders Lane, a few blocks north, in the East Village. There, the storefront had been flung open—no worries that the pungent musk of Avenue A was especially assertive on this late-summer night—and homesick Australians were stoked to see that the bar menu included a sausage roll. (Imagine if Dominique Ansel crossed a hot dog and a croissant.) At a table, the menu gets more refined: softshell crab with a Thai chili sauce; a lovely poached-chicken salad with peanuts and pea shoots; Australian lamb, encrusted with wattle seed, from the indigenous acacia tree, with a taste approximating peas and coffee.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">For dessert, there are distinctly Australian ice creams: one based on Milo, a popular malt beverage; another on the Anzac biscuit, a much-beloved cookie made with coconut and oats; and the best, Lemon Myrtle, from another native plant with an intense flavor, like incredibly excited citrus. Does the proliferation of Australian cafés mean we’ve reached peak flat white? Possibly. But, as these restaurants—and the continued false equivalence of Vegemite and cream cheese—demonstrate, there is still much to discover. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="11" word_count="11"><em>The Musket Room, entrées $26-$32; Flinders Lane, entrées $16-$25.</em></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/sandbox/tables-for-two/"><em>View more restaurants in our Tables for Two map</em></a>.</p>

Waltuck’s playful, lighter take on classic French cuisine resonated with the artists in the neighborhood, and in 1989 the chef and his wife, Karen—who graciously handled the front of the house, writing out the menus and arranging the flowers—moved the operation to Tribeca, where they perfected their game, with soothing butter-yellow walls, impeccable service, and some of the most elegant and unpretentious food in the city. Chanterelle, perhaps too formal to compete in a struggling economy, closed in 2009; now Waltuck is back with a new restaurant, élan.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">By opening in the Flatiron district, Waltuck is announcing both that he’s in the big-boys club—Eleven Madison Park, Craft, ABC Kitchen, and Gramercy Tavern are all within a few blocks—and that he’s playing it safe. That’s O.K., though, since Waltuck’s safe is delicious and decadent. Gone are Chanterelle’s quenelles and crazy salad, made with lobster, papaya, and foie gras, the last of which shows up here in something like an adult Tootsie Pop, coated in pistachios, with a figgy center. Sweetbreads, a staple at Chanterelle, appear in a lively General Tso’s preparation, with a sticky orange-inflected glaze. Uni guacamole, served with taro chips, causes initial suspicion—isn’t anyone who wants to improve guacamole just showboating?—but the uni holds its own, lending a welcome salinity and richness.</p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">Considering Waltuck’s culinary standing, the dining room is small. A whitewashed brick wall nods to the chef’s downtown roots, and to the casual air he seems to be trying for, even if he can’t help but send out perfectly composed plates. The crowd is full of sophisticates, many of whom will reminisce over his signature dish of seafood sausage—lobster, shrimp, sea scallops, and sea bass packed into a pork casing—with mustard-infused beurre blanc. It still sounds slightly off-putting, and still surprises with its salty-sweet delicacy. Technique is where élan really shines, in dishes like the striped-bass filet, with crisp skin and a deep red-wine sauce, and a smoky oolong-tea-infused duck breast, perfectly rare. Waltuck favors unctuousness, and goes overboard in the sea-scallop fettuccine coated in melted duck fat. But zucchini blossoms with lemon crème fraîche are ethereal, and tomato-watermelon gazpacho with lobster tastes like pure summer.</p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">Karen is missed (she has moved into a social-work career), but there are many signs of humility and finesse at élan. The wine list is full of accessible bottles, with a section called “Treat Yourself,” so you don’t have to see the three-hundred-dollar Burgundy and feel like a piker for ordering something under sixty. On your way out, there are lovely chocolate truffles filled with caramel—salted, of course. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open every night for dinner.

Broadway 	41.2611835	-95.9140798	212-219-2777	2014/09/01	<p data-wc="108" word_count="108">“I don’t care what you wear, as long as your feet and your genitals are covered,” Drew Nieporent, the avuncular owner of Bâtard, said to a couple in the corner who had been admiring the relaxed atmosphere of his restaurant. It’s a testament to the obscene deliciousness of what they were eating that neither stopped. They were on dessert, which was milk bread, a Christmastime treat from Germany. Analogies tumbled forth: the caramelized crust broke with a crème-brûlée crackle; the puffy, unctuous interior was like the world’s best French toast; the contrast in textures reminded them of iced donuts from childhood.</p><p data-wc="163" word_count="163">The milk bread was gone even before Nieporent had moved to the next table, to hold forth with stories from years past in the same Tribeca space—and photos, too, loaded on his iPhone. There was a shot of the crew from his first restaurant, Montrachet. (You could tell it was the early eighties because of the hair gel.) A few years after that popular bistro closed came Corton, a frankly luxurious experience for the boom years, and the expense accounts, of the mid-aughts. The room is an unlikely spot for so many nice dinners. It’s L-shaped, with barely any windows and a ceiling as low as a brownstone basement’s. And yet, with Bâtard, Nieporent has created another special place. The aggressively relaxed dress code and clubhouse-like atmosphere take nothing away from the sophisticated northern-European food—if anything, it feels just right for now to serve a serious three-course meal, at relatively gentle prices for the neighborhood, without a tablecloth.</p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">The menu makes few concessions to the heat of a New York summer. Veal is one thing; wrapping it in bread, <em>tramezzini</em> style, with a cube of sweetbread on the side, is not necessarily appealing to someone who was recently on an A train with no air-conditioning. But just about everything’s enjoyable, even if you didn’t know you wanted lamb chops dusted in parsley bread crumbs, doused in jus, with a side of lamb bacon and vegetables in a Le Creuset pot. Memories of dishes lingered for weeks afterward: an appetizer of heirloom tomatoes, all angles and preposterously bright, scattered with Sicilian pistachios, daubed with avocado, dressed with a hint of vanilla; an octopus terrine, made with pastrami spices and chunks of braised ham hock, meaty with an interesting aftertaste of brine. Before the lamb, the octopus, and the milk bread, there was another dairy-based confection: the Southern cocktail known as milk punch, enjoying a moment in some of the city’s fancier bars, which steeps for nine hours, so that the drink winds up clear, rather than cloudy. Bâtard’s comes in a little bottle, with a label around the neck reading <em>trink mich</em>, or “drink me” in German, and the two diners, dressed in jeans, did. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open for dinner Tuesdays through Sundays.

Meyer recently announced that he will move the Café from Sixteenth Street to an undetermined location when his current lease is up, on account of the rent being too damn high. That’s bad news for the neighborhood, but good news for the Pavilion Market Cafe, a new restaurant that’s moved into the Square’s imposingly neoclassical band shell; it probably wouldn’t exist without its predecessor, and might have a hard time competing with it. In a way, the Pavilion’s loyalty to the Greenmarket one-ups Meyer’s, because it’s mandatory: part of the deal that the restaurateur Simon Oren (Nice Matin, Five Napkin Burger) struck to secure the lease was that he’d feature “market day” specials using goods from the farmers who set up shop just outside.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">Across the menu, the food, though not particularly adventurous, is much better and fresher than you might expect from a restaurant in one of Manhattan’s most trafficked hubs. An appetizer of fried calamari, scattered with sweet garlic chips, sliced chilis, and black sesame seeds, comes on a delicate tomatillo purée. Salads are meal-size but not unrefined: the shredded-kale Caesar is dressed with roasted-garlic vinaigrette and a pickled anchovy, the classic Greek elevated by sharp local feta and crisp nubs of toasted pita. Nineteen dollars seems steep for a simple, if delicious, pappardelle al pesto, but in the end it’s a better deal than a gigantic but confused special of an overcooked, fat-ringed Hudson Valley pork chop that comes with both grilled blue-velvet apricots and a pitcher of black-cherry sauce, plus slightly soupy farro, for $32.50.</p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">The Pavilion’s opening has been protested by community advocates who argue that an upscale restaurant is a perversion of public space. “Let’s see how douchey this place will get,” a commenter wrote on Gothamist. Levels were high on a recent Tuesday: by the bar, a conversation between two men in suits shifted seamlessly from “More chicks coming my way!” to “How do you know your assets are growing?” In the dining room, lush with potted palms, music from speakers overhead clashed deafeningly with an orchestra playing outside for the hoi polloi. On a Saturday, post-Hamptons exodus, the scene was calmer, the patio populated by just a handful of diners under orange umbrellas, enjoying white-wine-steamed mussels with herb-flecked golden fries and cocktails like the Rialto—a sweet-and-sour mixture of dark rum, tea syrup, pineapple, and bitters. A tiny park mouse frantically circled the flower-box perimeters. To the west, the night sky was lit up with L.E.D. slingshot helicopters, set aloft by hawkers on the Square. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

It’s impossible to stay mad at Iris Café Store #9, which feels like the best-kept secret in a neighborhood that’s known less for its interesting dining than for its streets named after fruits. The restaurant, an old storefront done up with Edison bulbs and fresh flowers in the window, started as a breakfast joint, famous for its exceptionally sticky buns and rustic feel. For the past year, locals have been wandering in after work to enjoy a modest but lovely dinner service that’s conversant in the clichés of the borough—think kale croquettes—but never succumbs to them.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">You will have by now guessed the basics: a menu that changes frequently, a kitchen that encourages sharing. But you might not have predicted that the obligatory tomato-and-burrata appetizer is served on miniature scallion pancakes, resulting in a deeply satisfying mix of temperatures (room temperature, cool, straight out of the deep fryer) and textures (juicy, smooth, crunchy). Similarly, those kale croquettes take the “Put an egg on it” routine, by now familiar to all who have eaten at farm-to-table establishments, to the next level, because the egg yolk is cured, and then in its dehydrated state grated on top. Those little golden specks somehow work to intensify the flavors of what could taste like spanakopita into something vaguely umami, like a memory of miso.</p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">These are not party tricks but signs of an imaginative mind. The chef Joey Scalabrino seems determined to upend expectations. (A recent feature on eater.com spoofed trendy restaurant menu items: “truffle oil-tainted mashed potatoes,” “an unconventional riff on brussels sprouts,” “tarted-up pork belly.”) Yes, there’s an octopus dish, served with what is described as “really good olive oil,” but the trace of Meyer lemon, easily abused in excess, elevates the traditional preparation. (On another night, slivers of plum brought acidity.) Or take the roast chicken, an exercise in symmetry, two elegant fingers, seared so they develop an impressive crust, with a flourish of green garlic spiralled across the plate.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">We could talk about what, exactly, is in the tangy, lemony sauce that accompanies the ribbons of summer squash dusted with crushed pistachios (avocado and Greek yogurt). Or about the charming way two different desserts—a tiramisu and an Earl Gray crème brûlée—came with raspberries on top, as though the kitchen couldn’t resist a reminder that this was the height of summer. When you’re eating, you won’t much care about the why. Sort of like how the Old-Fashioned will do just fine, thanks. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

McCarren Park Pool party organizers held “Rock Beach” indie-band concerts, the concession stand Veggie Island served kale juice and miso sandwiches, surfers and artists thronged the peninsula’s white-sand beaches—some even chose to forgo the hour-long A-train commute from Manhattan and moved there. But in 2012, just as the Rockaways seemed destined for a fair-trade knitting shop and a Café Grumpy, Hurricane Sandy brought fifteen-foot waves and ten-foot floods, leaving the place in shambles.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">Now Rockaway Beach, undeterred and still scruffy, is poised for a renaissance, with a beautiful new boardwalk being built, a site-specific PS1 exhibition curated by Klaus Biesenbach, and Mayor de Blasio’s promise to make good on the $4.2 billion Sandy recovery fund. It’s good news that Rockaway Taco (95-19 Rockaway Beach Blvd.), which opened in 2008, is still there. Lines are long for perfect beer-battered fish tacos, crisp plantain strips with mild, creamy guacamole, and fresh watermelon juice. Rippers, too, is thriving. The punk-rock-blaring, lime-green-walled Eighty-sixth Street concession, opened in 2010 by owners of Roberta’s and the Meat Hook, attracts beachgoers with Shake Shack-style burgers, thick fries (even better topped with a blend of melted Cheddar and American cheese), and a slightly sloppy but delicious grilled dogfish (i.e., shark) sandwich, on a soft sesame bun with black-bean spread, spicy mayo, and dill pickles. The sandwiches are cheap, the ocean views free.</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">Hidden away, a few blocks from the beach, the Rockaway Beach Surf Club is fostering a scene that’s something like Venice Beach by way of Bed-Stuy. Owned by Brandon d’Leo, a Long Beach-born sculptor, and Brady Walsh, a Coney Island firefighter, the spot originated as a hangout where surfers could store their boards and commune. This year, they partnered with the folks from Lodge, in Williamsburg, to offer barbecue and brunch out of a food truck. It’s parked in the yard, which is outfitted with handcrafted reclaimed-wood tables, bamboo, sunflowers, and murals painted by local artists and neighborhood kids. (An ecstatic flowering skull extolls the mantra “Live Surf Die.”) The chef, Patrick Quinn, originally from North Carolina, designed the menu of beer-boiled peanuts in the shell, sriracha-honey smoked wings, vinegar-doused pulled pork, and masa-crusted shrimp po’boys. There’s also a tender kale salad with specks of quinoa and ultra-summery grilled watermelon with mint pesto.</p><p data-wc="66" word_count="66">On a recent clear, bright Saturday, various tan, bearded men popped in after surfing since sunrise to use the wooden outdoor shower and talk shop, debating the virtues of the super-rare ten-thousand-dollar surfboard vs. the seventy-five-dollar foam plank that even a first-timer could ride.

They spend an enormous amount of time in restaurants and bars, however, and it stands to reason that the savviest way to coax them offshore is with food and drink. Transpose the steely, iPad-wielding host to the end of a gangplank, and you’ve got Grand Banks, a new oyster bar on the Sherman Zwicker, a gorgeous 1942 fishing schooner currently docked at Pier 25, in Tribeca. On a recent Friday, a young hopeful gazed longingly at the throngs of Panama-hatted men and maxi-dressed women who’d made it aboard—at a hundred and forty-five persons, the hundred-and-forty-two-foot vessel had reached capacity. “It’s my birthday—can I just push ’em over?” he asked. “This is just like Nantucket!” a burly blond in a white polo piped.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">The scene on deck was quite pleasant, if somewhat treacherous—a flood tide rocked the boat, and some patrons perched precariously on the narrow ledge of the gunwale. As the sun set over the Hudson, bartenders dressed in nautical stripes and aviators mixed tastefully themed cocktails like the Engine Room, an ideally tart mixture of lager, aquavit, ginger, and lemon, and sunset-hued Negroni Sbagliati (Italian for “incorrect”), made with Prosecco instead of gin. Naked Cowboy oysters from the Long Island Sound, along with creamy, clam-shaped Kusshis from Vancouver Island, supplemented several truly small plates—an arugula salad with ricotta, figs, and thyme-infused honey gets you barely a handful of greens, and an order of fried squash blossoms comes with just three—courtesy of Mark Firth, a former partner at Diner and Marlow &amp; Sons.</p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">Due east, another ship plies landlubbers with the promise of “a New England tavern on the water.” The Skyport Marina is crowded with booze cruisers, but it isn’t hard to discern the group that’s waiting to board the Revolution, a beautifully restored vintage Navy Yard Patrol boat; they’re the ones with the tote bags and clogs. One-upping Grand Banks, the Water Table hauls anchor, offering a two-and-a-half-hour tour of the East River, along with a three-course dinner. Cocktails—particularly the Monkeyfist, a bracing combination of Navy Strength rum, Moxie (the official soft drink of Maine), and lime—are best enjoyed on the upper deck, but the views are no less spectacular from the enclosed cabin, which seats forty. The food that emerges, charmingly, from a hatch in the floor—chilled cucumber-yogurt soup in Mason jars, dry-rubbed boneless chicken breasts, lobster rolls—might pass muster at a picnic, if not at most Brooklyn restaurants. But, on a clear night, the ghostly silhouettes of Roosevelt Island—plus ice-cream floats made with root beer, mandarin soda, or chocolate stout—are sustenance enough. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="25" word_count="25"><em>Grand Banks: Open weekday evenings, and weekends starting at noon; small plates $14-$18.

At Barchetta, a new Italian restaurant in Chelsea, there are eleven, and that’s probably too many. Each preparation of raw seafood has an exotic-sounding accompaniment: Indian River grapefruit, Spanish olive oil, Antarctic sea salt. Yet the crudo tasting, selected by the kitchen, winds up a haze of indistinct citrus flavors, pooled in oil, punctuated with too much salt, and occasionally verging on chewy.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">It’s clear that the restaurant, whose name means “little boat” in Italian, is yet to find its sea legs. The service, in particular, is odd. Four or five people who seem to be affiliated with the operation, though not necessarily versed in greeting diners, hover by the door, but once you’re seated waitstaff are elusive, and getting advice on the erratically priced wine list requires patience. The general air of confusion is surprising, since the man behind Barchetta is Dave Pasternack, who, with Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, created Esca, which, even after fourteen years, is the city’s gold standard for Italian seafood.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">One ingredient associated less with high-end seafood establishments and more with hotel room-service menus is melon. In a dismaying turn, the soft-shell-crab special on a recent evening came with a mountain of it. The crab itself, slick with a lemony glaze, had a burnt, almost acrid taste. (The menu changes often, and a later, more promising iteration came with asparagus and radish.) There are few additions to a dish that bring as much reliable joy as crispy capers, and they make a welcome appearance, in the midst of a bewildering meal, scattered on top of golden troutlings. The little fish are so addictive they have the potential to undercut fried calamari’s stranglehold on bar menus. The squid here is eaten whole, in a traditional Mediterranean preparation, swimming in its own ink. It’s grilled, not fried, and tastes meaty, a little sweet, and a lot more interesting than when battered and dunked in marinara sauce.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">After the highs and lows of the seafood antipasti, there is a benign lobster fettuccine, and a clam fusilli that has Calabrian chilis but very little heat. The waiters tend to push the whole porgy as a signature dish. The serving is ample, and it’s pleasantly heavy on the rosemary. What else is memorable? The acoustics, which sometimes allow the raucous conversation from a table of men in suits drinking Barolo to waft over the rest of the place. And then there’s the rhubarb crostata.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/07/beyond-beirut	Beyond Beirut	Au Za’atar, 188 Avenue A 	null	null	null	2014/07/07	<p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Lebanese restaurants don’t get a lot of love in New York. Their roster usually includes a decent hummus or tabouli and some better than average grilled meat, dishes that seem to have roots elsewhere. But the truth is that Lebanon has a deep bench of culinary influences that goes back thousands of years, to a time when that fertile strip of land to the east of the Mediterranean began its streak of besiegement by foreigners, including, but not limited to, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks, and, perhaps most auspiciously, in a culinary sense, French.</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">Au Za’atar, a new Lebanese restaurant in the East Village, attempts to tap into this rich history, billing itself as an Arabian French bistro. Opened this spring by a Lebanese émigré, the restaurant has a vast menu that includes Tunisian couscous, moules frites, and Arabian cheeses. The kebabs are juicy, and the eggplant-based <em>saltet al raheb</em>, a spicy-smoky condiment, is good enough to eat by the spoonful. <em>Kibbe naya</em>, a lamb tartar, has a bit of a soup-mix flavor, and may be an acquired taste. The thick <em>labne</em> goes perfectly with the best thing in the house, which is also on the house: fluffy homemade pita brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with za’atar, a vibrant blend of thyme, sumac, and sesame seeds.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">It is puzzling that Au Za’atar would pop up so close to Balade, an older, more charming Lebanese restaurant a block west. The cozy dark-wood interior, accented with sepia shots of Beirut, feels more in line with the city’s nickname, the Paris of the Middle East. Balade has similarly vast offerings, and it’s a nice spot for sipping Lebanese rosé and snacking on topnotch baba ghanoush. It specializes in <em>manakeesh</em>, which is billed as Lebanese pizza but is really nothing like pizza, except in that it is circular and has toppings, low on the melted cheese. But, if you’re in the mood to load up on carbs, you might be happy to hoard the <em>manakeesh lahme baajin</em>, basically pita topped with spiced ground beef and chopped tomatoes.</p><p data-wc="145" word_count="145">While Au Za’atar and Balade feel moored to the old country, Toum, a roving lunchtime food truck named for the pungent raw-garlic spread, offers a distinctly contemporary take on Lebanese cuisine. Don’t let the smiling head of garlic in a chef’s hat painted on the side of the truck scare you—there is greatness here. The chicken shawarma is juicy and brightly marinated with white-wine vinegar and garlic; cubes of beef taste exotic with cinnamon and sumac. The best might be the grilled kafta sandwich: pita, as thin as a tortilla, layered with ground beef that is smashed, spiced, and grilled, along with tomatoes, pickles, parsley, onions, and tahini. Toasted and cut into quarters, like a Lebanese quesadilla, it’s difficult to eat, but when slathered with toum and hot sauce it’s crunchy and chewy, tart and sweet, all at once.<span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Au Za’atar entrées $12-$23; Balade entrées $7-$30; Toum sandwiches and platters $6.50-$12.</em></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/sandbox/tables-for-two/"><em>View more restaurants in our Tables for Two map</em></a>.</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/30/schmear-campaign	Schmear Campaign	Russ & Daughters Café, 127 Orchard St. 	null	null	null	2014/06/30	<p data-wc="135" word_count="135">On a recent Sunday afternoon, two men sat back to back at Russ &amp; Daughters Café. One, in his eighties, reclined in a wheelchair, wearing a nylon tracksuit; the other, in his thirties, sported chambray and skinny jeans, cuffed to expose bare ankles. The Lower East Side has changed tremendously in the hundred years since Joel Russ opened a tiny shop to supply a mostly Jewish neighborhood with “appetizing,” defined by his great-grandchildren and successors as “the foods one eats with bagels.” But, inflation aside (at $1,895, five hundred grams of Osetra Gueldenstaedtii caviar costs about as much as a month’s rent for a studio apartment on East Houston Street), Russ &amp; Daughters has remained almost exactly the same, and has sold enough smoked fish and cream cheese to open a full-service restaurant a few blocks away.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The Café is a master class in how to court both the old and the new, imbued with a hard-earned air of authority and gorgeously designed to pay detailed homage to Russ &amp; Daughters’ history and to the mid-century soda fountain. Wallpaper makes art out of sesame seeds and Take-A-Number tickets. Servers, wearing white lab coats and ties, deliver frothy egg creams and platters of sable and Gaspé Nova, glistening like candy, to marble tables in sun-washed slate-green booths. Diners kvell over salty-sweet chopped liver, dressed with pickled onions and schmeared on matzo toasted golden brown; cool, silky borscht topped with dill and sour cream; and scrambled eggs folded around delicate slivers of sturgeon.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">For food to eat with bagels, nobody beats Russ &amp; Daughters. When it comes to bagels themselves, the playing field has been levelled, thanks to a renaissance led, for the moment, by a nearby bakery called Black Seed. Purists will protest, for Black Seed’s bagel is modelled, in part, after Montreal’s, which is skinnier and more oblong, boiled in honey water, and baked in a wood-burning oven. (Black Seed is co-owned by the Montrealer Noah Bernamoff, of Mile End.) But it smacks of New York, too, with its assertive saltiness, satisfying density, and smaller hole—all the better for sandwiches, which the shop does extremely well, pairing bubblegum-pink tobiko spread with smoked salmon and butter lettuce, and whitefish salad with cream cheese and sweet marinated cucumbers.</p><p data-wc="67" word_count="67">At Black Seed, it takes twenty minutes to get a sandwich that any veteran bagel counter would have ready in five, keeping tattooed young locals jostling impatiently for iced coffee and tapping their feet to Nirvana and TLC. But its very existence acknowledges what came before it—and what better to snack on than a Black Seed sandwich while waiting for a table at Russ &amp; Daughters Café? <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="30" word_count="30"><em>Russ &amp; Daughters Café open Wednesdays through Mondays from 10 <small>A.M.</small> to 10 <small> P.M.</small>; smoked-fish platters $70-$90.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/the-runner-2	The Runner	458-460 Myrtle Ave., Brooklyn 	40.69368695	-73.9838792334718	718-643-6500	2014/06/23	<p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Following in the tradition of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. is the Runner, another restaurant inspired by art. Time has not been kind to “Forrest Gump,” the movie that spawned the seafood chain; Walt Whitman, who lived in Clinton Hill for a stint and wrote the short poem from which this excellent new neighborhood joint gets its name, is doing better. The chef, Andrew Burman, formerly of the cult sandwich shop Court Street Grocers, takes the connection beyond a volume of Whitman’s poems in the bathroom—practically obligatory for a certain kind of Brooklyn restaurant anyhow—with a menu that looks back to the writer’s era in New York. It’s an elaborate, slightly twee conceit, but now there’s another place to eat roasted oysters, and many of the other throwback preparations are also surprisingly delicious.</p><p data-wc="164" word_count="164">Much of Burman’s menu makes use of a vestigial six-foot wooden oven in the corner of the dining room, installed for the Italian restaurant that was in the space before. In addition to superb wood-fired breads, including a tongue-shaped lavash-like loaf served with whipped walnut-raisin butter, there is a selection of “roasts,” including an exceptionally crusty cube of braised short rib, topped with horseradish and julienned beets. That short rib is the Runner at its best: old-fashioned tastes, lightened up with vegetables, reconceived for people who sit at desks all day and want to share. “The flavors are light enough that you won’t get sad-full,” promised a waitress, and she was right. A dainty portion of salt-baked trout, also finished in the oven, is unusually delicate, prepared not in a rich French style but with preserved lemons, black olives, and plenty of chervil. The dish is seemingly custom-made for dining outside, on the Platonic ideal of a Brooklyn patio, festooned with petunias.</p><p data-wc="163" word_count="163">The downside of small plates can be erratic portion sizes, an occasional issue for the Runner. A standout rice pilaf (a phrase never previously uttered) is listed as a side, but it comes with so many goodies, like pork, clams, and a scallion aioli to mix into the rice, that it’s substantial enough to order as a main course. Another hearty side, asparagus with mozzarella and walnut pesto, is as weird as it sounds—oddly sweet, and, because the cheese has been melted on top, uniformly stringy. On a recent evening, a table of four passed around a vat of mussel soup, piled high with sautéed peppers and chunks of tomato. In what will come as a relief to anyone who has ventured into the ambiguous depths of a creamy seafood stew, the soup was broth-based, and tasted like a particularly interesting French-onion soup, without the cheese. It was an experiment, and it worked, and Myrtle Avenue is better for it. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/09/tavern-on-the-green	Tavern on the Green	Central Park West at 67th St. 	null	null	null	2014/06/09	<p data-wc="141" word_count="141">In 1976, after two years of renovations, Tavern on the Green reopened with a bang, and this magazine ran a Talk of the Town story describing the “two-and-a-half-million-dollar, stop-at-nothing, one-thousand-seat-capacity update” of the 1934 sheepfold turned restaurant. On the menu: New Zealand wild boar with gingered apples and lingonberries ($9.50) and pizza ($2.50), prepared by fourteen French chefs. In the brand-new, glass-walled Crystal Room: seven-foot-tall Baccarat chandeliers from Indian palaces, a molded-plaster ceiling in “light mint green, birthday-candle pink, and telegraph-blank yellow,” and a “fantasy mural” with flowers, birds, and butterflies. On opening day, Mayor Abe Beame dipped into the world’s largest ice-cream sundae (7,250 pounds of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry Sealtest), drank a toast from a nine-litre bottle of champagne that had crossed the Atlantic in a first-class Air France seat, and, with a sword, cut into a sixteen-foot-long cake model of Central Park.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">After an uncertain interlude following a bankruptcy in 2009, the phoenix has risen again, under new management and with considerably less fanfare. On a recent evening, a couple at the oval-shaped mahogany bar—crowned by a gilded mobile of flying horses—didn’t bother to hide their disappointment, complaining about the prices (“Twenty-six dollars for four slices of salmon, ya kiddin’ me?”) and eulogizing: “Remember the older place? It was amazing.” But nothing could dampen the enthusiasm of Ryan, a young grad student from Queens, who was feeling lucky to be moonlighting as a server in the former Crystal Room, now sparer and mostly white. “The opportunity to resurrect a landmark at twenty-four years old . . .” He trailed off dreamily, before explaining that the menu was divided by heat source into three categories—“The Hearth,” “The Grill,” and “The Plancha”—and that the hearth made “a very intimate situation for a lamb shank.”</p><p data-wc="164" word_count="164">That formidable bone-in hunk of meat, which comes with creamed chard, pickled raisins, and roasted cauliflower, appeared on many tables, calling to mind the Disneyland turkey leg—fitting, given the Tavern’s theme-park overtone, complete with gift shop and doorman in jodhpurs and top hat. Like most things on the menu, the lamb sounds better than it looks or tastes and costs more than it should. A “Serrano ham, cave-aged Gruyère, and sage sandwich” amounts to a tiny, eighteen-dollar grilled cheese, and the “warm local squid salad” is not so much a salad as it is a single squid. Of course, the food is beside the point, and, judging from the restaurant’s past reputation, it might be better now than ever before. Still, it’s a letdown to discover that the brownie sundae is the world’s dinkiest, consisting of a grainy brownie, a single scoop of salted-caramel ice cream, and a paint swipe of chocolate sauce. Mayor Beame had it good. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

Before sitting down to eat, there’s the lobby’s bar to negotiate, inevitably packed, and dominated on a recent evening by British tourists laden with Century 21 shopping bags and by men using the word “iterate” who looked like UrbanDaddy subscribers. Eye contact with the bartender, let alone an elaborate mescal cocktail, was an impossible dream. What a relief it was, then, to enter the comparative calm of the dining room—where the walls glow Ladurée green, and the décor is like Wes Anderson’s fantasy of a French bistro—heartened by the promise of a light, fresh, eastern-Mediterranean meal.</p><p data-wc="210" word_count="210">Let us set aside the pernicious creep of the phrase “complimentary water,” the drink menus dispensed like Moses’ tablets, and the denial of a perimeter booth in the empty room because they were “reserved for hotel guests.” It’s nice, if a little L.A., to begin a meal with crudités, but the green tahini sauce was hidden underneath a piece of lettuce, only to be discovered once most of the vegetables had been eaten. Continuing the healthful theme was a Farmer’s Board of red-quinoa tabouli, spicy smashed sweet potato, avocado hummus, and beets with “grains of paradise,” a peppery seed from West Africa. The sweet potato showed up again, later, with the best of the entrées—a roast chicken—and that’s fine, because it was interesting and smoky, and somehow tasted like bacon. The chunky consistency of the avocado hummus made it inferior to guacamole, and the crispy buckwheat crackers were too fragile to dip into it, in any case. Other problems showed up before the mains: a heavy-handed approach to a citrus dressing on a fennel salad; a cauliflower custard with a striking resemblance to scrambled eggs; and a salad in which artichokes were cut into spiky, fibrous slivers, and were tough to eat.</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">A sea-urchin-adorned tagliatelle tasted appropriately funky, almost shoelacey, and Arctic char with peas and watercress was suitably verdant. Unusual decisions surrounded the burger, a staple of any hotel-restaurant menu. Why pickled jalapeños, especially with English Cheddar? The effect was disorienting, and the dimensions delicate. The best bet is that chicken, the skin blistered and blackened in the rotisserie, and a green harissa just the right grade of spicy. As for dessert, you might wonder why you have never eaten feta ice cream before, but that is before you try it: the feta was too salty, and the texture unpredictable, when it should have been nothing but smooth. It came with a rhubarb crostata, neon-colored, cold, like a leftover Danish from the breakfast service. Luckily, lingering is not encouraged—the table needed to be cleared for another party, so there was nothing left for the guests to do but pour the last dregs of rosé themselves, and leave. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Navy, their adorably tricked-out new restaurant (wartime deprivation, <em>si chic!</em>), sits on a quiet SoHo block in the former home of Jean-Claude, a beloved French bistro. When asked what inspired all those signal flags, the clever galley latrine, and the crisp blue-and-white ship-motif tiles, one dapper gentleman working the lunch hour replied, “It was inspired by World War II and the thirties and forties, obviously, but really it’s because it’s a seafood restaurant.”</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">Depending on what time it is, the vibe ranges from extremely pleasant, during the day (open French windows, Bien Cuit croissants, and tables of people who look like they’ve lived in SoHo since before Chanel moved to Wooster Street), to cramped and contrived, at night (squint-inducing low light, Pitchfork-approved indie soundtrack, and diners who look like they can’t wait to find the <em>next</em> next hottest place, A.S.A.P.). Lunch is a lovely affair, with young, optimistic, unflappable waitresses. One weekday afternoon, almost every dish on the daily-changing menu came with an expertly cooked egg and/or toast, which was a little weird for a seafood place. But there were also a lot of raw greens—pea shoots, watercress, parsley—and their freshness livened everything up. Avocado toast was topped with pickled mustard seeds and radish and fennel slices, and whitefish salad, with a poached egg over a light crispy quinoa cake, had a satisfying zing. A thick skirt steak with creamy-crunchy potatoes (and eggs) showed a deft hand in the kitchen, which is run by Camille Becerra, whose Greenpoint restaurant Paloma was lost to a fire in 2008.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">The presence of a church up the street dictates that Navy cannot serve hard liquor, and in the evening the proprietors try very hard to make do with cordial- and wine-based drinks, which lean toward the medicinal. “Sherry cocktails? This is never going to catch on,” one naysayer grumbled before switching to beer. The oysters and black-bass crudo were fine; the fried sweetbreads (with apple, jicama, and rémoulade) and mussel toast (with aioli on hearty thick-cut wheat sourdough) were better. The brined crispy-skinned tarragon chicken trumped the trout <em>en croûte</em>, which was embedded with tangy sorrel sauce—it was very pretty, but the <em>croûte</em> lacked crunch.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">An odd lunchtime dessert—a charred grapefruit topped with heavy salt and fennel seed—had a whiff of creativity run amok. But a baked pear with granola and yogurt was just right, and, unlike at dinner, there wasn’t a waiter hovering nearby, eagerly awaiting the guests’ departure. As neighborhoods rapidly change, so do their services, and if SoHo didn’t know it needed a Second World  War-naval-ship-themed seafood restaurant, who can blame it? <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="16" word_count="16"><em>Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/pickle-shack	Pickle Shack	256 Fourth Ave., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2014/05/19	<p data-wc="88" word_count="88">A vegetable-resistant man and a pickle-averse woman went to lunch at the Pickle Shack, a vegetarian sandwich shop. They made this unlikely choice because they’d heard that the small Park Slope storefront, distinguished from Fourth Avenue’s general dreariness by a pickle barrel on its awning, houses one of the city’s largest selections of Dogfish Head craft beer on tap. Sitting in the back garden, he wound up, unexpectedly, with an unfiltered Kolsch; she got Dogfish’s Midas Touch, described unofficially as the Chardonnay of beers.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">Their first thought on the restaurant’s concept was that it had to be a caricature: the provenance of all the ingredients, made in-house or sourced locally, was listed on the menu, which fluttered gently in the breeze off the Gowanus canal. The idea came from—who else?—“Brooklyn’s premier hipster pickler,” Shamus Jones, of Brooklyn Brine, a wholesale business around the corner. The chef is Neal Harden, formerly of the expensive, and precious, Pure Food and Wine, in Gramercy. At Pickle Shack, Harden still works only with vegetables, but shuns mock meats. That there was no seitan or cornstarch stir-fry was of considerable relief to both diners.</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">So the two of them got sandwiches, which turned out to be better than they could have imagined. She got the one with charred eggplant, which she thought would be an Israeli-style <em>sabich</em>, but which was actually more of a true vegetable sandwich. The eggplant was in the form of a spread, made tangy with capers and delicate with mint, which allowed the crunch and taste of grilled baby artichoke and harissa-pickled carrot to burst forward. The man chose the ricotta sandwich, thinking it might be sort of like a calzone. It arrived stuffed with garlic-sautéed bitter chicory, roasted butternut squash, and sage leaves. Reluctantly, he was impressed. There was the right ratio of bread (Runner &amp; Stone sesame seed) to filling, and the vegetables successfully stood up to the oozing and abundant ricotta. Like “Peter and the Wolf” in sandwich form, each ingredient could be identified and enjoyed.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Still, the man’s favorite item remained the fried pickles, which were cornmeal-crusted and served with a preserved-lemon aioli. The woman’s highlight was the fries: so good she demanded the secret from the waiter. “There’s a lot to fries,” he said philosophically, before recounting the kitchen’s four-step process (boiling, frying, freezing, frying again). They moved on to an Italian stout called My Blueberry Nightmare, which the menu said has “notes of model airplane glue” and tasted not unpleasantly like balsamic vinegar, and were surprised to admit that they couldn’t think of a more satisfying casual dining experience in the Slope than this one. What’s more, they were full! The final thought from the table was this: Many of the neighborhood’s restaurants serve complicated food ineptly, but Pickle Shack serves simple food well. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner.

A ten-minute walk in one direction will bring you to Drunken Fish Sushi &amp; Lounge, which, despite its name, is dry as a bone; a ten-minute walk in another direction will bring you to a strip club called Pumps, where the booze is abundant but the tax is steep, and must be leveraged in dollar bills. It’s not altogether surprising that the house recommends the latter: Bunker is the passion project of four skating buddies who grew up in Elmhurst, and the place has a slapdash, dude-bro vibe, with men in the kitchen and men working the tiny, dressed-down dining room, wearing graphic tees and fitted caps and whipping plates from kitchen to table with gruff certainty.</p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">It’s that certainty that makes you feel sort of O.K. about spending a pre-dinner hour watching ladies gyrate in G-strings: these guys know what they’re doing—would they steer you wrong? The chef and the sous-chef—the brothers Jimmy and Jacky Tu, who’ve cooked at Eleven Madison Park and on the Korilla BBQ food truck, respectively—are ethnically Chinese and have spent a lot of time in Vietnam, where their father lives. The <em>bún</em> in Bunker is the Vietnamese word for vermicelli rice noodles, a staple of authentic Vietnamese street food, which the Tus aim to re-create.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">Soft tangles of <em>bún</em> serve as pedestals for several standout dishes, including thin, tender cuts of glazed and grilled lemongrass short ribs scattered with peanuts and shiso, and fat, juicy quarters of charred eggplant and zucchini punched up with dill and fried shallots. <em>Banh</em>, or bread, is well represented, too, in a selection of <em>banh mi</em> sandwiches—including the Saigon Special, featuring house-made pâté and bacon—and in two versions of <em>banh xeo</em>, an impeccably crisp fried, omelette-like rice-flour crêpe dyed yellow with turmeric powder. The prospect of grappling with shell-on shrimp in the street sounds messy, but in the <em>tom thit ram</em> you eat them whole, their exteriors caramelized so that they almost melt in your mouth, bearing the subtle spice of gingersnaps.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">On a recent night, chicken—from a company that sells “Buddhist-style” birds, with head and feet on—was sadly stringy in an impressively fragrant, cardamom-and-cinnamon-rich <em>pho ga</em>, and showed up again as mostly bones in an otherwise excellent curry, full of carrots and potatoes. But these slips, like the strip club, are forgiven in light of the restaurant’s other charms, including the creamy tapioca pudding, spooned over coconut, palm seed, and jackfruit, and the skateboard propped up against the bathroom sink. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open Tuesdays through Fridays for dinner and weekends for lunch and dinner.

When Bolo closed, in 2007, it wasn’t owing to flagging attendance but because the old Flatiron-district building that housed it was being demolished for a condo tower. Meanwhile, as a Food Network linchpin, with slick shows like “Throwdown with Bobby Flay,” “Brunch @ Bobby’s,” and the latest, “Beat Bobby Flay,” the New York native has become one of the most recognizable chefs in America. You might presume that with great fame comes cynicism. (See: Guy Fieri’s Times Square theme-park fiasco.) But at Gato, Flay’s eclectic new NoHo restaurant, the chef himself is cooking some amazing food, as though he’s still got something to prove.</p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">One recent spring morning, Flay said, “I’m using the entire Mediterranean as my inspiration . . . Italy, France, and Greece, a little bit of Morocco, of course Spain.” Accordingly, the menu is a little bit all over the place. But Flay knows that while some people crave small plates of seared duck liver (with red grapes and black pepper) and beef crudo (cubed and tossed with pickled Fresno chilis), others will migrate toward pizza (even if it’s topped with goat cheese and capers), a comforting cube of eleven-layer potato (like a cheeseless gratin, with cream, butter, and garlic), and “charred beef” (tender strip-steak medallions, made decadent with melted butter and blue cheese, and modern with nutty farro and broccoli rabe).</p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">As though in a tacit throwdown with ABC Kitchen, nearby, Flay has concocted some killer vegetable dishes. Purple, white, and orange heirloom carrots are blanched, then rubbed with smoked paprika, fennel, and mustard seed, seared, and then roasted, until they’re soft inside and crusty outside. They come on harissa-swirled yogurt, topped with a pomegranate-molasses vinaigrette and fresh mint. A very polite server delivering a pan of kale and wild-mushroom paella painstakingly explained the allure of the dish: “The soccarat is the crispy rice at the bottom. I’m scraping the pan so you can get two textures.” There’s also a deeply flavored crab risotto with Calabrian chili and tarragon, a juicy grilled and braised Berkshire pork chop, and a delicate yet substantial steamed halibut served over a smooth piquillo-saffron-tomato sauce. Missteps are rare, and tend to come from overreach, as in the fried artichokes with uni and quail egg, which sounds promising but quickly becomes a salty, soupy hodgepodge.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Reservations are difficult. One Saturday at 5:30, when the vast space was mostly empty, an icy hostess told a walk-in couple: “We are fully committed in the dining room, but it’s first come, first served at the bar if you want to take your chances.” Chef would not approve. “The one thing I keep telling my staff is that the award I want to win is nicest restaurant in New York,” he said. That’s probably not going to happen, but if it’s about the food it’s Bobby for the win. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/28/the-writing-room	The Writing Room	1703 Second Ave., at 88th St. 	null	null	null	2014/04/28	<p data-wc="122" word_count="122">When this restaurant was Elaine’s, the food was beside the point. Think of the scene in “Manhattan” that took place there, in which Mariel Hemingway tells Woody Allen she needs to leave their double date early because she has an exam the next day. It’s so dark you can barely see their faces—that’s because Elaine Kaufman, the longtime proprietor and legendary smoker, reportedly got the lights from a funeral parlor. And even though it’s dinnertime, no one’s eating. “The key thing to remember is that the food at Elaine’s sucked,” said an Upper East Side resident who frequented the legendary literary hangout, which lasted forty-eight years, until a few months after Kaufman’s death, in 2010.</p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">What’s new? Not the famous canopy, which still juts out to Second Avenue, although it’s now a corporate-colored charcoal, rather than bright yellow. There’s a Disneyland feel to the décor, with photos from the glory days (Gay Talese, Jackie Onassis) hanging in the main dining room alongside blown-up renderings of typewriter keys, while out back wall-to-wall bookshelves are filled not with eclectic paperbacks but with a carefully curated selection of books, many by past regulars. We are eating among ghosts, but that’s no excuse for the veal meatloaf: gray, pallid, probably a decent packing material for jewelry.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">The benign mediocrity of Elaine’s red-sauce Italian food has been replaced with middle-of-the-road newish American cuisine of the kind you might imagine Stephen Colbert would enjoy when in character: doughy Parker House rolls to start, baby-back ribs with a barbecue sauce that tastes only of apples, stealth carbs—a puzzling hunk of flatbread—hidden underneath the spinach salad, spaghetti and meatballs as dry as the Great Plains. There are chopped hearts of palm in the farmer’s salad, and wilted romaine, utterly vanquished by a green-goddess dressing, but only one of these retro touches is charming.</p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">At the end of a recent dinner, there was a cheesecake that was also a cobbler, as though the problem with that dessert were its fundamental asceticism, and more funnel cake than you’d get in a serving at Six Flags. All of this would be fine, even fun, if it were delicious, but it’s not—the funnel cake, for instance, comes with Meyer-lemon mousse, which makes you long for the simple powdered-sugar finish of the original. Elaine’s was never about the food, and that was O.K., because it was about so much else.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/21/little-lamb	Little Lamb	40-24 College Point Blvd., Level B, Queens 	null	null	null	2014/04/21	<p data-wc="147" word_count="147">Unless you’ve got a hankering for a Subway sandwich or a Five Guys burger, the Shops at SkyView Center, a mall packed with big-box stores like Target and Best Buy, may seem like the least likely place to eat in Flushing. And yet, around the corner from Chuck E. Cheese and just past Applebee’s, one of the world’s most thrilling culinary experiences awaits, at a place called Little Lamb. To be fair, one man’s Little Lamb is another man’s Applebee’s: the restaurant is part of an Inner Mongolian chain that claims around six hundred locations worldwide, and one of several suspiciously similar places in Flushing that offer the East Asian specialty known as hot pot. But this is the first and only official Little Lamb in New York, and, especially for anyone unfamiliar with hot pot, a meal here is extraordinary.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">It begins, of course, with a pot, piping hot, perched on an electric burner in the center of each table, and brimming with broth made from beef bone, bone marrow, and chicken. It’s described almost Biblically on the menu: “When boil is ready, we add our mixture of little lamb special sauce. Then it became the ‘God Soup.’ ” The special sauce is customizable: House “Mala” Spicy will set your mouth on fire and turn the liquid a murky red, bobbing with dried chili peppers, numbing peppercorns, garlic cloves, whole nutmeg, and cinnamon bark; a more timid palate would be better off with the House Original, cloudy yellow and swimming with scallions, ginger, and goji berries.</p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">Once the God Soup is roiling, the diner becomes the chef, tasked first with menu planning, choosing from dozens of raw ingredients, which arrive in bite-size pieces, and then with cooking the haul, by dropping things into the pot and determining when to scoop them out. The first step can be difficult, thanks to curt descriptions and sometimes unappealing translations (Supreme Lamb Shoulder is “Under Cervical Vertebra and it taste soft”). But many items are straightforward—napa cabbage, enoki mushroom, fresh tofu—and taking risks can yield high rewards, as with House Fish Noodle, which turns out to be ribbons of dough sparkling with shards of briny dried fish, and Sun Volume, a platter of lamb slices ringed in fat and appealingly fanned in a circle. The true challenge is in the timing: most meat is cut so thin that it needs only a few seconds in the pot before it’s overcooked, but taro root takes several minutes, and the optimal texture of baby bok choy is a matter of taste.</p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">The menu offers a handful of excellent things that arrive ready to eat—perfectly flaky scallion pancakes; cumin-rubbed, lusciously fatty lamb ribs “grilled until the tasty come out”—but none are quite as satisfying as what comes out of the pot. Cooking your own food is a good reminder of what hard work it is, just as the enormous backlit photographs of sheep grazing in sunny fields are a good reminder of exactly what you’re eating. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="12" word_count="12"><em>Open daily for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/14/willow-road	Willow Road	85 Tenth Ave. 	42.0536775714286	-71.0002425714286	646-484-6566	2014/04/14	<p data-wc="85" word_count="85">Willow Road is situated on a windswept stretch of Tenth Avenue, sandwiched between two temples to the gods of gastronomy: just to the south, with its wood-burning oven and cavernous elegance, is Colicchio &amp; Sons, a destination for the “Top Chef” cult; a few doors north is Del Posto, a church of Molto Mario, with thirty-nine-dollar spaghetti. In both of those cathedrals, you know exactly where you are: in the shadow of the High Line, amid the tourists, the foodies, and the pork belly, circa now.</p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">Willow Road is much more confusing. Upon entering, you might think you’re in Brooklyn, what with the displays of vintage ephemera—old Brillo boxes, a basket of out-of-date, sample-size soaps (Camay, a Best Western bar), black-and-white photos of cheerleading squads. But after you sit down you see that that’s impossible, because there is no kale on the menu, and, though there is a fancy little bowl on every table, it’s filled with humble Morton salt, not the pink Himalayan chunks or the shiny white flakes that would be offered in that borough to the east. The baseball-capped crowd, and the fact that there are giant televisions mounted on the wall on which diners can watch basketball games or the Oscars, suggest that perhaps you’ve somehow stumbled into Murray Hill—and the Guns N’ Roses and Duran Duran on the stereo further that impression. The prices, however, are clearly meatpacking district.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">The menu is similarly disorienting. There’s a braised-octopus starter with the zesty umami kick of Korean kimchi, and a burger that’s made Middle American with the addition of pimento cheese and Russian dressing. (It’s better than it sounds, though the bland white bun needs upgrading.) For a bit of the bayou, there are Cajun shrimp served with blistered peppers. The quality of the offerings is as varied as their origins. Though Caesar salad ain’t broke and doesn’t need fixing, Willow Road’s unorthodox version, with black garlic, is pleasing. Not so the Market Salad—which sounds artisanal, with its promised beets, radish, and ricotta salata, but arrives looking and tasting as if it came from the same hotel as the Camay.</p><p data-wc="59" word_count="59">The only time Willow Road really makes any sense is when it hosts an event. Recently, a movie-première celebration was held there, under the strange chandelier made of old milk bottles. When Willow Road is crowded and there are lots of its tasty short-rib meatballs in circulation, it is finally clear where you have found yourself: a party. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="13" word_count="13"><em>Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

Even when it’s filled with bone marrow and it sits in a puddle of Parmigiano aioli. Just as a deep-fried rice ball will always taste like oil and starch, a shrimp popper doesn’t taste all that different from its battered-jalapeño brethren. And seven dollars for three pigs in a blanket? This isn’t Costco, but you wouldn’t necessarily guess that in a blind taste test. It’s hard to know how much ironic distance was intended from TGI Fridays when Bill Telepan, the Upper West Side’s undisputed king of the greenmarket, put together the menu for his downtown venture, Telepan Local, but you might wish there’d been more.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Not that there’s anything wrong with fried food. Once past the bar snacks, some of the best things on the menu are fried, like the delicious watercress salad—familiar to legion SriPraPhai fans, and prepared here with cashews, plenty of chili oil, and abundant disregard for any vestigial health benefits the leafiest of greens might possess. “Telepan unplugged” could be the slogan at this self-consciously casual venue, where the waiters wear Steven Alan plaid, trucker hats bob in the open-ish kitchen, and Goldman bankers from the office nearby, standing in black power suits three-deep at the Carrara-marble bar, order up all of the sourdough “pizzettes” on offer. (Jordan Belfort would probably be unimpressed, but charging both the Brussels-sprout and fried-calamari varieties to the company card must be what passes for hedonism in the financial world these days.)</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Three to four plates are recommended per person, tapas style, though they vary in size and composition, and so it’s difficult to get an order exactly right. Grilled beef short ribs, for instance, come piled high, on a sizzling fajitas-style platter with kimchi, but in the <em>migas</em> (the Spanish answer to stir-fry, made with chunks of day-old bread and a bracing pinch of paprika, is having a moment) the bits of trout are scarce. It was an odd decision to chop up the broccoli rabe for a salad, and not the white anchovies served on top. As for the sunchokes with white mushrooms: why serve them cold, so that the only discernible taste was the mushroom vinaigrette? The temperature also seemed off on a cocktail called a lamb shot, made with rosemary-infused vodka, dry vermouth, and—in a twist surely intended for Instagram trolling—lamb consommé. It was gray and cloudy, and like cold soup.</p><p data-wc="42" word_count="42">Improbably, ice-cream sundaes for dessert fell short, even the peanut-butter one, which came topped with pretzel crumbs, like a clever college-dining-hall concoction. Telepan Local wants to be a “fun” downtown place, we get that, but fun still needs to be taken seriously. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

But there she is: Narcissa, her moony eyes staring blankly from a sepia-toned photo hanging next to the bar of the restaurant that Balazs named for her, on the ground floor of the Standard in the East Village. And there’s Balazs, his carefully mussed hair glistening in the incandescent light as he glides between two dining rooms that evoke a very rich and stylish person’s idea of a farmhouse, all sleek blond wood and subtle lace curtains and bespoke canvas chair covers.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">There’s nothing remotely rustic about the crowd, many of whom seem to be V.I.P.s, chatting matter-of-factly about meetings at the Vatican and photo shoots in Qatar; on a recent evening, a “clothier consultant” had dropped his business card in the bathroom. But when it comes to the food, the grange concept rings true: according to the Web site, Narcissa the cow “presides over” Balazs’s farm in the Hudson Valley, which is the main source of the vegetables, herbs, and eggs on an elegant but accessible menu from the chef John Fraser, of Dovetail, on the Upper West Side.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">Narcissa the restaurant could be called Carrot, considering the absolute reverence Fraser shows the root, swaddling a bundle in a mushroom-sunchoke pâté and flaky pastry for a sweet, earthy Wellington, and battering others to make fat, golden fries, served with a jalapeño-tofu dip. Fraser kneels at the altar of the beet, too, judging by how long and lovingly he roasts them in his open kitchen’s rotisserie oven, until their exteriors are charred and their interiors rival the consistency of tender steak, well deserving of the creamed-horseradish accompaniment.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">Fraser’s just as talented with animals, which is made particularly evident by a mound of Dungeness crab meat scattered with chopped hazelnut, blood orange, and basil, and by a juicy “lacquered” duck breast, its scored, fatty skin rendered crisp and almost candy-sweet, tempered by a dusting of dried herbs. The carrot returns for dessert, in wedges of cake that look Seussian, squiggled with cream-cheese frosting and adorned with poppy seeds, parsnip chips, and golden raisins. A citrus salad, served over tapioca pudding and under an orange-blossom granita, is a symphony of temperatures and textures, and perfectly embodies the careful line Fraser walks between virtue and indulgence. As a server described the house blends of herbal tea, also grown on the farm: “Good, and good for you.” <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open every night for dinner.

On the upside, the complimentary but soul-crushing wicker basket of day-old baguette and frozen butter is now difficult to find anywhere but the most cynical tourist spots. The humblest of offerings has become a way for chefs to signal their ingenuity, and at Contra, a new restaurant on the Lower East Side, three dollars is a fair price for a warm, dense loaf of French bread, baked with sunflower seeds and served with butter shot through with chocolate, whipped into peaks, and sprinkled with onion salt.</p><p data-wc="88" word_count="88">The food at Contra can be intricate, even challenging, but the concept is not: a prix-fixe of five courses, for fifty-five dollars. This seems low for a protein-heavy, technically showy meal from which no one will walk away hungry, but there are plenty of ways to spend more money. The add-ons vary in quality. That bread is important, but an eight-dollar cheese course is not; on a recent evening, it was an odd presentation of cheddar shavings, accompanied by a pine-nut nougat so salty it verged on inedible.</p><p data-wc="181" word_count="181">Whether you would like to eat here will depend on your comfort level with little crescents of celery in your elderflower-granita dessert, or pears blended into the onion soubise on your slow-roasted cod. Some of these unexpected elements work beautifully. Steak tartare came with XO sauce to up the umami factor, radishes the right side of sharp, and raw sea scallops, which were unsettling and intensely fishy yet also clean and beguiling in a way that raw beef could never be. Bits of smoked boudin scattered about a guinea hen were almost enough to distract from the bird’s sweet, lacquered skin, and wound up being the mysterious, funky dark to the hen’s juicy lightness. Giant chunks of pickled pear next to a too chewy pork loin didn’t work so well, nor did the dehydrated and then rehydrated orange and grapefruit slices on a goat’s-milk vanilla ice cream. (“Hungover citrus” was one unofficial description of the overly elaborate process, and there really was a parched crunchiness to the dish that suggested it could have done with some Gatorade.)</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">The wine selection is mostly organic, and not without drama. “They had an affair, and then they made this red. You can taste the infidelity,” said the sommelier of a wine that tasted uncomfortably like vinegar, and betrayal. A lot of the bottles have funny titles, like a cider called This Side Up, or a meadlike sparkling wine from the Ardèche called You Are So Bubbly, which made everyone seem so. Wines with nicknames are a sure sign that you’re dealing with the cool kids, and that’s exactly how eating at Contra feels: sometimes it’s too clever by half, but sometimes it’s thrilling. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open for dinner Tuesdays through Saturdays.

Those places have drastically different approaches to food, but both hold tradition in high regard, and find exquisite ways to elevate the bounteous seafood available to them. All’Onda has fashioned a lovely menu of seafood-driven crudi (or is it creative sashimi?) and homemade pastas, for a sophisticated foodie crowd.</p><p data-wc="159" word_count="159">Who can resist arancini? The rice in the fried bite-size spheres at All’Onda is mixed not with the classic Fontina cheese but with jet-black squid ink. They are garnished with scoops of fresh uni, resulting in a rapid progression of sensations—creamy, crunchy, oozy—and then they’re gone. Monkfish liver has been turning up as a sly substitute for foie gras; here it’s molded into a disk, set onto a square of grilled bread, and topped with a layer of smooth compressed persimmon, for a decadent riff on peanut butter and jelly. The crudi and the antipasti are plated as beautiful tableaux. Sardines, cut into chunky parallelograms and soaked with rice vinegar, are scattered silver skin up over a sweet fennel purée on a slate-gray slab. The delicately fried sweetbreads (“What are sweetbreads again? Thyroid? Oh, right, thymus”) arrive at the table crowned with pale-pink bonito flakes, which dance in the air, as if alive.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">The glazed white tiles and the handsome wood-planked ceiling say “farm to table,” but the rustic-looking pastas belie a complicated wrangling of many ingredients that suggests an approach more akin to modernist cuisine. The chef, Chris Jaeckle, who cooked previously at Ai Fiori, under the direction of Michael White (Marea, Osteria Morini), no slouch with noodles, takes what he has learned and twists it. Jaeckle’s bucatini is like a carbonara, with egg yolk, more of that uni (it’s sourced from Maine), and crunchy bread crumbs. One Michael White devotee deemed it even better than Marea’s vaunted uni-and-crab spaghetti. Great pastas abound—lumache with bitter braised Treviso, sweet shredded duck, and a touch of bittersweet chocolate; peekytoe-crab garganelli, zingy with herbs and yuzukosho paste (chili pepper, yuzu peel, salt); Manila-clam spaghetti, with an intense garlic-clam flavor infusing homemade square noodles.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">After a sublime primi course, the entrées feel beside the point, and the dorade and the monkfish are competent if not ethereal. The guinea hen, however, rivals the great roast chickens in town, with a crispy-skinned breast and a moist confit leg; it goes well with the memorable polenta mixed with miso-cured egg yolk. A lot of very nice people work here, and they make you want to like the strange soy-sauce gelato and the heavy olive-oil cake, just to make them happy, but you can’t. That’s O.K. Call it a night, step out into the cold, and dream of warm weather in the waves. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open every night for dinner.

The Table, a sit-down restaurant, is an offshoot of the Market, a gourmet grocer, which opened first in Dumbo and in 2012 expanded to Chelsea. In addition to the three-day juice cleanse and the panoply of expensive condiments (sixteen-dollar peanut butter, fourteen-dollar Sriracha), Foragers sells vegetables, herbs, and eggs from a dedicated farm in Canaan, New York.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">A list of other regional suppliers is on the back of the menu, but the Foragers farm salad will tell you everything you need to know: it doesn’t rely on a gimmicky or heavy dressing but, rather, on a barely discernable sherry vinaigrette, so the greens still crunch, and the sunflower sprouts remain springy. It makes a strong case for eating locally, supported by the devilled Foragers Farm eggs, the deliciousness of which depends not on paprika or truffle oil or bacon bits but on the eggs themselves, which give a clean bite and a grassy taste, like they were plucked from a particularly clever chicken this morning. (The farm delivers to the restaurant twice a week, so they might have been.)</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">Smart choices abound: a lamb Bolognese is prepared with trumpet pasta, and its nubbiness provides maximum nooks and crannies for the rich tomato sauce. The brown beech mushrooms in the same dish are almost exactly the same dimensions as the trumpets, so it’s a good pasta to eat if you’re on a date and don’t want to deal with the perilous fork twirls—or seasonal incongruity—of the spaghetti pomodoro. There’s a pleasing uniformity in the king-crab appetizer, too, a salad of colorful slivers (crab, snow peas, tarragon), which is driven by mayonnaise but not monopolized by it. The porchetta—heritage pork loin and belly roti—comes as a glistening spiral, the skin bubbly and golden, the fat intertwined, and impossible to separate out, which is how it should be.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The crowd is mostly young people, and old people paying for young people. There’s enough kale and quinoa to give you the option of being virtuous, and a reasonably priced three-course prix-fixe with desserts that are highlights, not afterthoughts. A maple pot de crème is accompanied by an outstanding brittle to crumble in, and there’s also an assertive coffee ice cream that tastes like a frozen Americano and is mellowed out with salty chunks of brownie. For those city-dwellers who live in apartments without kitchen counter space, it’s the highest compliment to say that you would like to eat at a particular restaurant every Tuesday night. Foragers Table is such a place. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="15" word_count="15"><em>Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner and weekends for brunch. Entrées $22-$26.

On a recent evening, a septuagenarian who could have walked out of an Al Hirschfeld drawing expressed unadulterated rage at the mere suggestion that his party of two might not be seated at the table he desired, because it was meant for four. His companion, an ash blonde wearing white stockings, white cowboy boots, and a white fur vest, stared dully into space as he sputtered. If you live for people-watching, and for floor-length mink coats, and for lines like “I <em>don’t</em> want to be on the family dole,” you’ll be in Heaven at Betony. If you disdain those things, you’ll have no trouble tuning them out, thanks to the spectacular new-American food, distinctive cocktails, and impeccable service—that angry man was quickly soothed by a team of three.</p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">Are you familiar with milk punch? By the end of a conversation with Eamon Rockey, Betony’s almost scarily knowledgeable general manager, you’ll know everything about it, including the fact that Benjamin Franklin had his own recipe. Betony’s version doesn’t look like much, and it doesn’t look like milk, thanks to a complicated-sounding clarification process that renders it colorless. But it tastes like magic: smooth, sweet, and spicy—depending on a changing roster of seasonings, such as bergamot tea and Thai bird chili—topped off with your choice of spirit and served over a gigantic ice cube.</p><p data-wc="140" word_count="140">The executive chef, Bryce Shuman, who comes from Eleven Madison Park, looks like an insurance salesman but cooks like a maestro, extracting more flavor than seems possible from familiar ingredients. In one dish, foie gras gets whipped like butter and formed into bite-sized “bonbons,” coated in chopped cashews and served with coarse salt and pepper. In another, foie gras is smoked, chilled, and sliced thin, then rolled into tubes, like decadent deli ham, and plated with toasted barley and caramelized kabocha squash. Roasted chicken breast is almost unrecognizable, filleted into an elegant rectangle of succulent white meat sealed with crackly golden skin and accompanied by a bowl of confited leg, puréed salsify, and fragrant Périgord truffles. Luscious poached lobster gets a rich bath in its own bisque and finds perfect partners in meaty chestnuts and delicate whole carrots.</p><p data-wc="60" word_count="60">Rockey could talk for hours about his Kola Flip—a frothy play on rum and coke, featuring cola he painstakingly makes from scratch—and suggests it as a dessert cocktail. For a cocktail dessert, try the butterscotch pudding, made with the hard stuff, of the Islay variety. Like all else at Betony, both will leave you in a happy stupor. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="14" word_count="14"><em>Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner, Saturdays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/empire-diner	Empire Diner	210 Tenth Ave. 	-27.4933669	153.0502935	212-596-7523	2014/02/17	<p data-wc="125" word_count="125">Sure, there’s the Chrysler and the Empire State, but this diner in Chelsea is more quintessentially New York than just about any other building. The Empire Diner’s art-moderne exterior has been featured in movies and on TV shows, and also on the cover of this magazine, which praised the “glitz-free, gemutlich” vibe of the place in 1998, when it was the official hangout of the city’s art world. It shut in 2010, after thirty-four years of late-night patty melts and piano jams, and then reopened, briefly, as the Highliner, which convinced no one. Now Amanda Freitag, formerly of Tribeca’s coziest restaurant, the Harrison, has reinvented the icon, but unlike the last time around, there’s not a hint of New Coke about it.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">The most important question: how’s that patty melt? This is a sandwich that should make a burger look grotesquely high maintenance. There’s no way to separate the layers, no customizing of toppings, because it has all been bound together with butter and drippings. Freitag’s version, refined but not annoyingly so, meets this criterion, while also insuring the correct balance of crunch (toasted rye) and ooze (Swiss cheese and caramelized onions). Mystifyingly, it comes with taro chips—what you get from the bodega when you don’t know what you want—but there are plenty of other opportunities to enjoy the restaurant’s adequately thick-cut fries.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">The melt is part of an all-day menu that coëxists with more unexpected riffs on Greek-diner classics. Taking the scooped-out bagel to its logical conclusion, a creamy mess of “lox and burrata” is sprinkled liberally with, well, everything: burnt sesame and poppy seeds, dried onion bits, flakes of salt and garlic. That, and a weirdly compelling buffalo-skate-wing appetizer, are among the few carb-free options. The matzo-ball soup comes with bone marrow to stir in; a variant on the Happy Waitress, as New Jersey as a traffic jam, features not just a poached egg but also Taylor ham and a cheddar-cheese sauce resembling hollandaise. Even a side of Brussels sprouts feels decadent, partly because of the sweet chili relish on top, but also because there’s way more salt than necessary.</p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">Way more than necessary seems to be the rule, and that extends to the enthusiasm of the waiters. “Here’s what we’re gonna do,” they say before coursing out an order with a mysterious but impressive internal logic. When asked for their favorites, they end up running through just about the whole menu with the aplomb of someone who has recently auditioned for something. The crowd might be having as much fun as the staff. Young families, their tabletops littered with sippy cups and mezcal cocktails, tend to finish their meal by attacking the Platonic ideal of the banana split, all wet walnuts and melting Neapolitan ice cream. The kitchen brûlées the banana, but, like true New Yorkers, they’re all too busy to care. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/10/saul	Saul	200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn 	40.6709108	-73.9633156304714	718-935-9842	2014/02/10	<p data-wc="124" word_count="124">“The shop’s closed,” the security guard in the lobby of the Brooklyn Museum said, blocking the way of three diners who had a six-forty-five reservation at Saul. The new-American restaurant moved recently to the back of the museum, past the gift shop, from its home of fourteen years, on Smith Street, in Boerum Hill. The original Saul was one of the first spots in Brooklyn to receive a Michelin star and to lure Manhattanites in serious numbers across the river for dinner. The guard wasn’t the only one who seemed confused; the hostess was unsure about the feasibility of a pre-dinner drink at the half-empty bar, which was unfortunate, because by that time everyone in the group felt that they needed one.</p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">It’s strange to be in such a massive, industrial space in Brooklyn, hearing about the Vermont farm where the pork-loin special got its start, but you still wish the restaurateurs had celebrated the space, rather than trying to hide from it. Aside from a pair of Paul Kelpe murals (from a series called “Williamsburg Housing Project”), the dark, low-ceilinged room works hard to make diners forget they are situated inside a treasure trove of art. Maybe it’s the square dinner plates, or their tableau-like composition, but there’s a generic, business-class quality to the eating experience. When the strawberry-balsamic ice cream and the baked Alaska arrive, the sense of being in a Ritz-Carlton in the late nineteen-nineties is fully realized.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">The restaurant’s uneasy status as a pioneer of a movement (rustic, farm-fresh) that has changed over time is encapsulated in the emphasis on vegetables even as there is not much for a vegetarian to eat. On a recent evening, a meal was cobbled together via a farro-salad special with a poached egg, and a parsnip soup the consistency of thick cream, which came with a heavy-handed drizzle of vanilla oil—simple food, but without the careful seasoning required to make it interesting.</p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">A waiter said the seafood’s the thing. And who would dare to complain that a mackerel appetizer was too fishy? Everyone who ate it, it turns out, a collective of salty-fish aficionados who found the cut—chunky, like beads on an art teacher’s necklace—hard to stomach, and the puffed rice and assertive strands of scallion tossed on top unhelpful. “I don’t think I’ve ever actually said I want less bacon” was the judgment on a monkfish entrée, cooked to a velvety consistency but overwhelmed. Meat was reliably good: a venison loin with wild mushrooms and a rich red-wine <em>jus</em> was so adeptly prepared it could have been a steak, and that pork special, served with quince and cabbage, was a traditional take just right for the polar vortex. Saul’s move from Smith Street, the closest thing Brooklyn has to a restaurant row, to the six-lane Eastern Parkway was never going to be easy, but pulling it off will require doing more than what has always been done. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="17" word_count="17"><em>Open Wednesdays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

The former is everywhere, the latter available mostly in out-of-the-way, drably decorated dining rooms in or near cities with large immigrant populations. But expectations are changing, not only because authentic restaurants are increasingly targeting the mainstream (Han Dynasty, a new Szechuan place in the East Village, shames timid diners by listing Americanized dishes like fried rice and spring rolls in the “Kids/Baby Adults” section of its menu) but also because a generation of young chefs is bridging the gap.</p><p data-wc="179" word_count="179">Last fall, Jonathan Wu, a Bronx-born Chinese-American who once cooked at Per Se, opened Fung Tu, a “creative” Chinese restaurant on the Lower East Side, in what used to be a small noodle factory. (Wilson Tang, a co-owner and the proprietor of Nom Wah, New York’s oldest standing dim-sum parlor, helped secure the lease.) The fashionably designed space bears no remnants of its former tenant, but the menu tells a deeply personal Chinese-American story. A relative of Wu’s who grew up in Shanghai before the Cultural Revolution remembered fondly a dish from his childhood—smoked black Chinese dates stuﬀed with red-bean paste, then egg-washed and deep fried—so Wu reimagined it, piping Medjools full of shredded duck-leg conﬁt and dipping them in a buttermilk batter. A dish of stir-fried celtuce, a lettuce-like vegetable hard to ﬁnd outside of China (tracking it down in outer-borough markets each week has been “a great source of stress,” Wu says), gets topped with a soft-boiled egg like the one Wu’s Taiwanese mother adds to her pig’s-foot broth.</p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">As a nod to Nom Wah, which claims to have invented the egg roll, Wu came up with the Original Egg Roll Version 2, ﬁlled with pork belly and, surprisingly, olives. His mother likes to snack on what are known as Chinese olives (actually an olive-like fruit) marinated in chiles and anise, so Wu tried the same treatment on Picholine and Niçoise. The eﬀect is a bit muddled—there’s something disconcertingly enchilada-like about the ﬁlling—and intention versus outcome is a problem across the menu at Fung Tu. But the dishes that work—like those duck-stuﬀed dates, and a plate of impossibly silky roasted beet slices daubed with salty fermented tofu—really work, and Wu’s ideas could go a long way toward redefining American Chinese food. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

Rotisserie Georgette has a simple conceit—roast chicken—but it’s a strikingly sophisticated space, with a clientele to match. The restaurant has many draws, but the second-best thing about it is its location. It’s on the Upper East Side, which means there is finally somewhere to go for something other than a salad after a hectic morning with the crowds at the Met. The best thing about the restaurant is the smell coming from the giant brass-trimmed ovens at the back of the dining room, where Pennsylvania chickens roast slowly in rotation. You can get one stuffed with wild mushrooms, draped with two slabs of seared foie gras, and served with a side of double entendre (it’s called Poule de Luxe, slang for a woman with expensive tastes), but the bird is better in an unadorned state, with a sauce of herbes de Provence, enough garlic to kick a cold, and sturdy pommes frites for mopping-up duties.</p><p data-wc="170" word_count="170">Diverging from the restaurant’s signature dish is not encouraged by the waitstaff, many of whom are French and have strong and abundant opinions on how the meal should proceed. It’s easiest to sink into one of the red banquettes, or a high-backed carriage chair up front, and surrender to the subtle opulence of the experience. Beyond the <em>poulet rôti,</em> options are scarce anyhow, and are dominated by other roasted preparations, like an appetizer of sap-green leeks, rendered velvety and sweet by the oven. Under the heading “Never Enough Potatoes,” there’s a stuffed, crisped Idaho potato, which is filled with creamy Parmesan mash to prove the point. What else is good? The pepper steak has a memorable crust. And that great Gallic bar snack <em>oeufs mayo</em> is topped with various salty whimsies—tapenade, chorizo, black truffle—and comes on a pewter tray. (The only thing to say about the cocktails is stick with wine, but veering between overwrought and watery mixed drinks seems an authentically French shortcoming.)</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">Dessert may not be up to you. At lunch, a parfait of prune-Armagnac ice cream and crumbled cookies might appear; at dinner, a tarte tatin. The tarte comes with crème fraîche, ladled tableside with dramatic flair, and at that point of exquisite freshness where it tastes more sharp than sweet. Order Muscadet and the selection will be waved away; Cognac arrives instead. (A gleeful “Oops, I poured too much!” accompanied an afternoon-ending glass.) On leaving, a prescription for the next day is given: the leftover chicken should be made into a sandwich. Use some mustard. It will taste even better than it did today. The annoying thing about all this French bossiness is that they’re right, of course. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="11" word_count="11"><em>Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/20/cafe-nadery	Café Nadery	16 W. 8th St. 	30.1625452	-85.6606674	212-260-5407	2014/01/20	<p data-wc="122" word_count="122">What ever happened to the intellectual cafés of Greenwich Village, where struggling artists could order a cup of coffee (not a Venti), read a newspaper (not an iPad), and talk to someone sitting across from them (not via text message)? Most of those tiny cafés have been priced out of the neighborhood, replaced by the Think Coffees, the La Colombes, the Stumptowns (don’t even mention that other place). Café Nadery is a descendant of those bohemian coffeehouses, with a twist—it’s owned by a collective of some twenty Iranian-Americans, and pays homage to an Iranian landmark. The renowned Naderi Café, built in 1928 in Tehran, was <em>the</em> place where writers and philosophers went to hobnob in its mid-twentieth-century heyday.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">New York’s Nadery, on West Eighth Street near N.Y.U., doesn’t look like much. The spacious room has an air of studiousness during the day (laptops and outlets abound), and warm camaraderie at night, when there might be a poetry reading or live music—from classical Persian oud and <em>kamancheh</em> (string instruments) to Iranian funk and soul tunes from the sixties (who knew?). Word that there is an actual Persian café in downtown Manhattan has got around among Iranians, and happy hour can be a boisterous affair; in addition to craft beers and affordable bottles of wine, there are several kinds of tea, the best being, appropriately, the Persian variety, served with honey-dipped sugar cubes.</p><p data-wc="88" word_count="88">Nadery’s menu was originally designed by Louisa Shafia, author of “The New Persian Kitchen,” whose vegetarian-forward influence can be seen in the lovely lemony kale salad and in the pleasantly sweet beet burger, accompanied by <em>torshi</em>, a pickle of finely chopped vegetables. The yogurt appetizer highlights this staple of Persian cuisine; properly strained, it’s thicker, subtler, and more luscious than any variety out of a tub. It’s served with potato chips, an unnecessary Americanization, since it’s best eaten with crunchy Afghan bread or <em>lavash</em>.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">Nadery’s delicious <em>ash-e reshteh,</em> the Persian soup that always has lentils, herbs, and greens but which every Iranian cook makes his or her own way, here includes chickpeas, spinach, and noodles. Garnished with onions fried with dried mint and <em>kashk</em> (a tangy by-product of cheese-making similar to sour cream), the soup is a full meal in itself. There’s a decent lamb-kebab special some nights, but nothing tops <em>ghormeh sabzi,</em> the ultimate Persian comfort food. The dark-green stew of beef, beans, dried lemon, and herbs is pungent with fenugreek, and, according to the son of an excellent Persian cook, Nadery “nails it.”</p><p data-wc="59" word_count="59">The original Naderi Café remains open in Iran, a symbol of freedoms that have come and gone in that country. With so much discussion, intellectual and otherwise, taking place on the Internet these days, it’s easy to forget that we are lucky to have places like Café Nadery, where we can wear, read, and say whatever we want. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="14" word_count="14"><em>Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

(Perhaps soon we’ll see a whole head at Chop’t: “Cartilage &amp; Crunch.”) And yet it’s still a little bit thrilling to hear that the special at Khe-Yo, a new Laotian restaurant situated amid the baby gyms and branded nail salons of Tribeca, is a pig’s-face salad. Even more so is the fact that the dish turns out to be rich, springy, and bright.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">Khe-Yo is not, improbably enough, the only place in the neighborhood with a connection to Laos: a couple of blocks away, Mangez Avec Moi is run by natives of that country, but their menu is more pan-Asian and takeout-focussed. The chef Soulayphet Schwader opened Khe-Yo because he didn’t know of any restaurants in New York that served the food his mother made at home. Like a lot of Laotians who came to America following the Communist takeover, in 1975, Schwader grew up in the Midwest, and when he wanted his Laotian fix he had to head back to Wichita. Khe-Yo is a joint project with the chef and restaurateur Marc Forgione, who brings an aggressively seasonal approach, and the result is similar to Thai food in its careful balance of sweet and spicy, but with the sour, funky element turned up a notch.</p><p data-wc="69" word_count="69">Laos is landlocked, so it’s not surprising that meat, rather than fish, is emphasized at Khe-Yo. Among the best dishes are a whole grilled quail on a stick, tasting like charcoal and ginger, and a steak tartare that’s served, Flintstones style, atop a giant bone filled with roasted marrow. These heavy proteins are lightened up with the ubiquitous bang-bang, a Thai chili sauce that is particularly incendiary.</p><p data-wc="133" word_count="133">You’ll also eat a lot of sticky rice. It arrives at the beginning of the meal, is meant to be eaten throughout, and is hidden in many dishes in another form, toasted and ground up. The resulting powder is similar in appearance and umami finish to old-school supermarket Parmesan. Sprinkled liberally, it practically declares an intention to mess with your tongue, as in the spectacular roasted-kabocha-squash salad, made with little beech mushrooms and mint. While a more traditional Laotian preparation would use chicken, pork, or duck in place of squash, the sticky-rice powder, along with red onion, Kaffir leaf, and chili, renders a familiar vegetable alien, in the most pleasantly disorienting way. It’s not as in-your-face as an entire animal head, but it’s another salad that deserves to catch on. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open daily for dinner.

It’s the ultimate neighborhood restaurant, the type of place where the food hits the sweet spot of being good (not to mention affordable) enough to warrant regular visits by locals but not so outstanding or in vogue that those locals find themselves vying for space with the destination-eating hordes. On weeknights, there’s hardly ever a wait for a table in the elegantly homey dining room, and when there is you’re invited to have a drink at the marble bar or at the adjoining candlelit speakeasy, the Mayflower. The list of craft cocktails is long, but, at this uncomplicated trattoria, none feels quite so appropriate as the nine-dollar Americano—with just Campari, sweet vermouth, and soda water, on the rocks.</p><p data-wc="187" word_count="187">The Italian-born chef and co-owner, Roberto Aita, a shy and gentle-seeming man who was last the chef and co-owner of Williamsburg’s similarly humble Fiore, has an instinct for appetizers, and, especially, vegetables. On a recent evening, a vinegar-sweet caponata of squash, celery root, and parsnip made an inspired foil for burrata. A hearty salad of kale and pumpkin flecked with grains of quinoa and tossed in a sour-cream vinaigrette was perfect topped with powdery cubes of feta that looked like miniature marshmallows. Pastas, which are all homemade, are more of a gamble: an understated bigoli (a long noodle similar to bucatini), lightly coated in sausage ragout and strewn with dark shreds of braised radicchio and coarse shavings of Piave, was expertly calculated, but oxtail ravioli in roasted bone-marrow sauce and brown butter fell short of its promise, somehow bland in spite of its ingredients. On a good night, the stuffed-trout entrée—a silver-skinned, palest-pink filet wrapped upright around a rich mix of bread crumbs and prawns and piled with crunchy slivers of almond—is phenomenal. On a bad night, it’s slightly mushy and over-sauced.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">But who cares? Aita is not a place to have the best meal of your life; it’s a place to sit and linger with friends and family, feeling comfortable and taken care of. There are several fine desserts on offer, including a tangy goat cheesecake with a hazelnut crust, but Aita is the type of place where your familiar yet unassuming server will bring you complimentary biscotti with the check. Besides, you might want to save your appetite and come back for the buttermilk blueberry pancakes at brunch tomorrow. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="16" word_count="16"><em>Open daily for dinner, Tuesdays through Fridays for lunch, and weekends for brunch.

The film shows the octogenarian sushi master Jiro Ono at work in his tiny bar in Tokyo’s Ginza subway station, where he dourly serves pristine thirty-minute omakase (chef’s choice) meals starting at three hundred and fifty dollars. Meanwhile, his middle-aged son and other apprentices try to demonstrate, to no avail, a similar dedication to perfection. One of those apprentices, Daisuke Nakazawa, tells of how he was brought to tears when—after two hundred attempts to make tamago, a delicate cooked egg custard—he finally won Jiro Ono’s praise. Borgognone tracked Nakazawa down, via Facebook and Google Translate. He was working as a sushi line cook in Seattle.</p><p data-wc="164" word_count="164">At Sushi Nakazawa, everyone gets the same thing: omakase. There is no soy sauce for dipping; only freshly pickled ginger and a wet cloth, so you can eat the traditional way, with your fingers. But this is not a hushed temple—Nakazawa starts cracking jokes before the first piece of salmon hits a granite slab. It is such a pleasure to be seated at the bright marble sushi bar, in the presence of the jovial, mischievous chef, that to be relegated to a table in the gray back room is a bit of a shame. But in either location the parade of nigiri—bite-size slices of fish on top of vinegar-seasoned rice—will lull you into an appreciative stupor. And, as if to indicate its seriousness, the restaurant has not one but two zealous sake sommeliers, conversations with whom resemble a Monty Python sketch: each sake description tops the previous one, in remoteness of town, rarity of rice, temperature of water, length of fermentation.</p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">On a recent evening, the procession started with Alaskan ivory king salmon with sea salt, followed by hay-smoked chum salmon; a sweet, firm live scallop with yuzu pepper; blowtorched geoduck from Washington State; and Long Island triggerfish topped with its liver, rich as foie gras. To introduce the barracuda from Tokyo Bay, Nakazawa waved around an iPad mini with a picture of the fish in happier times, and, with a wry smile, announced, “Japanese sennet!” Next were bonito from Kyushu; lean, medium fatty (“our No. 1 popular”), and fatty wild tuna from Boston; uni from California; steamed white sea eel.</p><p data-wc="64" word_count="64">When it was time for tiger shrimp from Florida, Nakazawa set the wriggling crustaceans out on plates and yelled gleefully, “Still alive!” Most of them tried to make a break for it, and, to the ones who didn’t, Nakazawa shouted, “Lazy shrimp!” and cackled. He then beheaded them all, and served their sweet, pearly bodies on top of rice, with a little wasabi. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="8" word_count="8"><em>Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

Sunchokes, as they’re also known, are dehydrated into a crisp and puréed into a spread, for an amuse; ground into a crispy “soil” to form the base of a market-vegetable plate; and roasted to caramelized oblivion before being topped with crispy hazelnuts and saba vinegar, as a side dish. The waitstaff push the roasted sunchokes, but no hard sell is required; all you need to know is that the dish’s starchy sweetness makes it as satisfying as late-night pommes frites slathered in mayonnaise.</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">The chef, Chris Cipollone—who made his name with incongruously inventive cooking in a midtown hotel lobby at Tenpenny—says sunchokes are his favorite ingredient, because they’re comforting yet unique. This notion also applies to the dining experience at his new West Village restaurant, where any description of the food is necessarily multi-hyphenated (New American-Italian-Korean, for starters), and the staff is pleasingly obsessive. “He’s been hand-squeezing cranberries all afternoon,” a waiter announced one night, referring to Shinya Yamao, the bartender, who had created a cocktail special made with Crémant de Bourgogne, a sparkling wine. Yamao had ordered a particular type of cloth from Japan for the task, and his kitchen whites were covered in bright-red juice.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">That dedication is extended to just about everything. Dishes are sometimes so involved that the waiters seem to be reciting soliloquies rather than specials. Don’t call the market-vegetable appetizer a salad—a few of the ingredients, like the obligatory micro-greens, are served raw, but others, including romanesco cauliflower, sweet potato, and Thumbelina carrots, are roasted, confited, pickled, or blanched. On a recent evening, the Thousand Island dust that coated the vegetables paired especially well with a dehydrated zucchini-blossom petal. The powder was tangy, and the petal was crunchy. It was like eating a Dorito.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Technique serves deliciousness, rather than distracting from it, in the suckling-pig entrée, which is presented like a meat bonbon: a neat brick of pressed pork, bookended with sprigs of julienned burdock, pickled and fried. It’s a strange object, with a stranger genesis. Cipollone roasts an entire pig in duck fat, removes the skin and extracts the fat, pulls meat from different parts of the animal in a precise ratio of light and dark, places the meat on top of the skin, inverts the whole thing so the skin is on top, and cooks it all a second time. The baking process hardens the skin into a golden shell that preserves the pork’s velvety richness, and crackles like the top of a brownie. It’s unique and comforting, but also just the right amount of disconcerting. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="9" word_count="9"><em>Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/09/the-lambs-club	The Lambs Club	132 W. 44th St. 	40.6815769285714	-74.1104735	212-997-5262	2013/12/09	<p data-wc="133" word_count="133">Madeleines, those enduring symbols of nostalgia, are on the menu at the Lambs Club, and the choice seems appropriate: the three-year-old bar and restaurant, which occupies the ground floor of a landmarked building that once housed the theatre club of the same name (Charlie Chaplin, John Wayne, and Lionel Barrymore belonged), feels like a shrine to things past. The opulent chrome-and-crimson dining room is a nineteen-sixties set piece, with leather banquettes and mid-century club chairs, Art Deco light fixtures, and torchiere floor lamps. Framed head shots of several Lambs, as members were known, line the walls. The largely male waitstaff, dressed in formal wear, practices a style of seen-and-not-heard hospitality that went out of vogue with Dover sole—which, as it happens, is available at dinner, for the up-to-date price of sixty-eight dollars.</p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">In general, the food, from the chef and proprietor, Geoffrey Zakarian, is more of the moment, or at least Modern American. Proust might not recognize these madeleines, which are smaller than traditional, laced with heady matsutake mushrooms, as plump and delicate as shellfish. Fresh spaghetti is dressed simply with olive oil, bottarga, and fresh chilis. Slow-cooked (and underseasoned) halibut, on a bed of polenta, comes surrounded by a Stonehenge of crispy frog-leg croquettes, each punctured by a dainty bone, and slices of juicy New York strip get a side of frisée salad, sprinkled brilliantly with shaved beef tongue.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">But what the Lambs Club does best befits its throwback vibe: the boozy business lunch. The Mad Man Cosmo—a sweet, woodsy concoction of rum, St. Germain, ginger, and clementine—would sate both Don Draper and Carrie Bradshaw. Classics like the chicken Cobb salad and the Dagwood turkey club are tempting, but order the pastrami sandwich and you’ll find a small army of those dapper waiters at your service: one to present the glistening slab of almost baconlike Wagyu beef, one to carve it tableside, and one to assemble it on rye with your choice of condiments (caramelized onions, whole-grain mustard, horseradish aioli, dill-pickle chips). It’s a timeless, delicious mess, and a little bit of theatre. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/02/charlie-bird	Charlie Bird	5 King St. 	6.8111127	-58.1641256	212-235-7133	2013/12/02	<p data-wc="86" word_count="86">“We just want to be your favorite neighborhood joint.” So says Charlie Bird, a new Italian-American restaurant off Sixth Avenue in SoHo, in a lengthy manifesto on its Web site. It also says that “Charlie Bird means New York,” and “Just like you, we dream of ditching work to sip rosé in the park and of hot summer nights all year long.” (Do New Yorkers, in fact, dream of hot summer nights all year long? Maybe the ones who don’t live in fourth-floor walkups do.)</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">What does it mean these days to be a neighborhood joint in downtown Manhattan, where on a recent Friday night a twenty-something waiting at the bar held a slate-colored Kelly bag, and the preponderance of four-inch heels suggests a general lack of familiarity with the subway? At Charlie Bird, it can mean some good things. For a start, there’s a real commitment to service: more places need to hand you a menu in return for your coat. There is a modest list of classic cocktails, not often seen (the Hemingway, the Blood and Sand). The food is comforting, with some ingenious additions, like uni in a creamy duck-egg spaghetti, and mint and pistachios in a lemony farro salad.</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">But Charlie Bird is expensive—paying less than a hundred dollars a person is difficult—and there are still more opportunities to spend money that feel ostentatious, like having truffles shaved on your pasta, for fifty dollars, or ordering a twenty-eight-dollar glass of wine. (Perhaps the prices are one reason that so many pairs of young women seem to be sharing a single piece of fish as their entrée.) On a weekend evening, you’ll need to lean in awfully close over the chicken-liver pâté appetizer, topped with walnuts and capers and radishes, or the pounded veal chop, which is golden and glistening with a crunch like K.F.C. That’s because it’s difficult to be heard above the newest Justin Timberlake album and also because of the jostling in the narrow bar area—a hazard of the extremely cool neighborhood joint welcoming walk-ins.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">It’s not Charlie Bird’s fault that it is so popular with a moneyed crowd. There is a roast-chicken dish that encourages repeat visits: four or five pieces of chicken breast, sliced round, daubed with more of that chicken-liver pâté and charred-leek ricotta and served with “crispy bits,” which a waiter described as “dipping agents.” It sounds like something dreamt up at the Nabisco food labs but actually amounts to old-school fried croutons tossed in chicken jus. There’s also a veal-ragu rigatoni—crunchy, chewy, with more meat than tomato—that is warming and hearty. The question of how one place becomes a scene while another languishes, though, remains a mystery. Does Charlie Bird mean New York? Maybe, amid the truffle shavings and the suits with sneakers, it does. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="7" word_count="7"><em>Open nightly for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/25/skal	SkáL	37 Canal St. 	33.5639485789474	-81.8077198421053	212-777-7518	2013/11/25	<p data-wc="126" word_count="126">Dinner at Skál, which means “cheers” in several Nordic languages, can feel surreal. The owner, Oli Bjorn Stephensen, designed the place to evoke a <em>baðstofa</em>, the communal living-and-sleeping room in the grass-covered cottages of his native Iceland. Situated on a fairly desolate corner where Chinatown and the L.E.S. meet, the restaurant is cleaner and brighter than anything around it. Soft light emanates from floor-to-ceiling windows, and a stuffed raven, a bird prominent in Icelandic folklore, perches above the formidable black linoleum bar. The pale-green solid-wood tables are far too big and too many for the narrow room, a problem compounded by the bulky school-desk chairs, but there’s something charming about the miscalculation, as if you’ve fallen through the looking glass.</p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">In the kitchen, Ben Spiegel, who spent six months at Copenhagen’s Noma, turns out food with a hint of magic, guided by Iceland’s temperatures: “It’s quite cold, so [we use] ingredients that store well, and grow better in colder climates.” The sweet simplicity of raw beef mixed with chopped littleneck clams and fermented wild leeks makes steak tartare look overwrought. The hot dog, beloved throughout Scandinavia, informs both the crispy lamb tongue, stuffed in hollowed-out ciabatta with Concord-grape jam, a green-garlic-duck-egg purée, and sage, and the boudin blanc, salami-sized logs of pork-and-chicken sausage, their pillowy richness cut by al-dente Tokyo turnips tossed in a sharp emulsion of mustard greens and horseradish. A dessert listed only as “beetroot, summer berries, skyr”—a generous dollop of tangy Icelandic yogurt piled with macerated raspberries, snips of dried beet, crisp shards of meringue, and an earthy, green sorrel granita—is thrillingly transportative, the culinary approximation of a hike in the snow.</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">Some dishes are less coherent, like fatty, pink, hay-baked lamb saddle, served, on a recent evening, with bottarga, whole sunchokes, and grilled pears. Pike with pickled plums and verbena and grilled monkfish with cabbage and peppermint were oversold and under-sauced. A dessert of oats and apples under a blanket of buttermilk foam, thyme, and dried apple-skin powder required a lengthy explanation from a server, but conveyed much less than that skyr with sorrel granita, or even a cold glass of Lava, a creamy smoked stout brewed in Iceland. If you didn’t know better, you might think you were sipping iced coffee with milk. It’s enchanting, and worthy of a toast. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="11" word_count="11"><em>Open nightly for dinner and weekends for brunch. Entrées $17-$55.</em></p>

He used to live in the borough in the mid-eighties, in Park Slope. Junior’s is an institution, and cheesecake is the sort of food politicians need to be seen eating, but if Obama had wanted to observe how his old neighborhood has changed, he could have gone a little further up Flatbush to Marco’s, an Italian restaurant that is both rustic and refined, and which exemplifies how much Brooklyn dining has changed since he lived there.</p><p data-wc="214" word_count="214">Marco’s is run by the people who ten years ago opened Franny’s in the same spot. Franny’s, which has moved nearby to a more spacious, stroller-friendly space, is a pasta and pizza joint, but the back of the menu lists the sourcing of most of the vegetables, and they won’t cut the pies into slices for you. (Typical rejoinder: “We prefer to serve our pizza as they do in Italy, and our customers find it fun to cut it themselves.”) The “Portlandia”-level preciousness is forgivable because the kitchen is equally meticulous. At Marco’s, a fancier and more expensive restaurant, the pastas are the primi, rather than the main event. As with Franny’s, though, each ingredient has been carefully chosen and is showcased simply, often to revelatory effect. Charred duck hearts and gizzards are skewered and drizzled with a mostarda made from Concord grapes, which for once taste more akin to wine than jelly; a mustard-greens salad comes with liberal shavings of Bitto, an Italian cheese from the alpine meadows of Lombardy so creamy it makes Pecorino look like an ugly stepsister; Carolina Gold Rice is dressed only with butter and basil-infused vinegar, yet tastes like it’s been scraped from a very good chef’s cast-iron skillet.</p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">A meal at Marco’s can feel hectic. Though the restaurant takes some reservations, the mounting stress of Park Slopers waiting out front is palpable. (Babysitters don’t pay themselves.) The acoustics are difficult, and the bartenders, who make five impeccable Italian-accented cocktails heavy on the Campari and Averna, are accomplished but overworked. Still, the tattooed waitstaff will talk comfortably and at length about tannin levels and the wonders of Castelvetrano olives, “the olive for people who don’t like them.”</p><p data-wc="94" word_count="94">Don’t go looking for comfort food—one of the more pedestrian selections, a bigoli pasta with cauliflower and anchovies, has the goopiness of cafeteria chow mein. But most of the menu represents a new standard for Brooklyn: spit-roasted pork loin, bathed in drippings, cut with a little grilled escarole; wood-grilled lamb chops served “scottadito,” or finger-blistering; a spectacular tagliatelle, dressed with a spartan butter-and-parmigiano sauce to accentuate the ribbons of twenty-four-month Gran Riserva Prosciutto di Parma. It’s known as the king of hams, but this dish is good enough for a President. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="13" word_count="13"><em>Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for lunch and dinner.

Chewy enough to test your molars, but also flavorful in a way that suggests more than just smoke? There’s a dish at Hunan Manor—a Manhattan outpost of Hunan House, in Flushing—that begins to approximate what beef jerky could be, if it tried harder. It’s called white-chili preserved beef, and it looks like run-of-the-mill stir-fry. The dish is an intense aromatic, redolent of ginger and scallions, but there’s no sauce. Instead, a low-level heat emanates from the white peppers, which have been boiled and sun-dried. They are shrivelled, almost translucent, and vaguely wraithish in appearance—an appropriate visual cue to their dangerous burn. The preserved beef has the oddly pleasing texture of shoe leather, and there’s so much to taste here: woody musk and sourness, like a fancy mushroom, or Parmesan cheese.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">Hunan is known for its preserved foods, and there are many others on the menu—pork, beans, bamboo. The beef dish also highlights some other trademarks of Hunan food: a lack of sauces; the dry heat of the peppers (in contrast to numbing Szechuan peppercorns); an insistently savory flavor, without sweet relief. Hunan Manor may look like any other Chinese restaurant in the Grand Central Terminal vicinity—dark wood interior, deliveryman in fluorescent vest, fortune cookies with the check—and the menu has plenty of Americanized favorites, but there are few places outside of Queens that offer the food of Mao’s birthplace.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">There are also some adventurous options that, while not strictly Hunan, are notable for their appearance in midtown Manhattan: stinky tofu, favored in Taiwan; sliced-fish-and-sour-cabbage soup, which comes without its traditional fish head but is satisfyingly pickled; an aspic-like thousand-year duck egg, which dulls the heat of spicy sautéed green peppers; and a spectacular Szechuan ox-tongue-and-tripe dish, the shavings soaked in so much chili oil that you can almost forget what you’re eating. Water spinach—an attempt to get some greens in—comes scattered with scores of tiny whole preserved fish, providing something like the umami explosion of anchovies on a pizza. The result is that you will eat more water spinach than you thought possible.</p><p data-wc="64" word_count="64">But the most instructive example of Hunan cooking is the cumin lamb, familiar to those who frequent Szechuan establishments. This one is sautéed rather than fried, and the coriander sprinkled on top makes it taste fresher, and lighter. There are the telltale scallions and garlic, and a vinegary turn—all of which, astonishingly, makes this giant plate of lamb taste very nearly delicate. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open every day for lunch and dinner.

But ever since Toro, the popular South End tapas restaurant, opened a location on the West Side Highway several weeks ago, New Yorkers can’t seem to get enough. The hundred-and-twenty-seat dining room, which takes reservations, is consistently booked, and the line at the door is long with hopeful walk-ins. Five-thirty may be an unfashionable hour for dinner, but it’s perhaps the best time to eat at Toro, before the crowds swarm into the hangar-like industrial space, outfitted in heavy wood, exposed steel beams, and neat rows of hanging hams. By eight, the acoustics can be deafening (the cranked-up club music doesn’t help), and the servers, friendly but aggressive (hold on tight to your drinks), dart around the room—and up and down the stairs to the basement kitchen—at top speed.</p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">There are no shortcuts to finding something good among the menu’s overwhelming selection of hot, cold, and grilled tapas, plus pinchos (smaller tapas) and paellas. Devilled eggs topped with salty slivers of conserved tuna belly are hard to argue with, and it’s easy to imagine eating ten of the warm Medjool dates, wrapped in jamón serrano and stuffed with Marcona almonds and Cabrales blue cheese, though they come only four to an order. Play-it-safe classics—tortilla española, patatas bravas—are lacklustre. The paella de langostino, with its mess of gummy, over-seasoned rice and measly scattering of lobster chunks and Brussels-sprout leaves, is, at ninety dollars (in a lobster glut!), downright insulting.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">Hard-to-find Spanish gooseneck barnacles, which taste like littleneck clams but resemble tiny dinosaur claws, are as fun to look at as they are delicious, and the rooster’s comb in a rustic dish of sautéed mushrooms has a pleasingly fungal texture and delicate poultry flavor. House-aged duck ham, meanwhile, tastes disconcertingly of chlorine, and it’s disappointing to discover that the grilled Catalan sea cucumbers you just paid twenty-seven dollars for amount to a tiny tangle of bland, shredded muscle, drowning in butter. In a city with so much great, affordable food, not to mention transcendent, expensive food, it’s a little hard to understand this uneven newcomer’s appeal. You could chalk it up to buzz—or maybe those people clamoring for tables are actually all homesick Bostonians. On a recent evening, one particularly jovial diner was wearing pants patterned with large, colorful sailboats. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="12" word_count="12"><em>Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner.

We were fifty-some-odd strangers gathered in a back room of a defunct Catholic school, now an antique shop packed with weathered tables, mismatched chairs, and assorted bric-a-brac (funky lights, funky cabinets). Simmons, who grew up in North Carolina and was formerly a retail strategist and an avid home cook, hosts dinners made by different chefs several nights a week. That evening, titled Collards and Carbonara, was named after a cookbook by Andrew Ticer and Michael Hudman, the owners of the Memphis restaurant Hog &amp; Hominy. Before even one boiled peanut hit the table, Ticer and Hudman, friends since high school, took the floor, and stumbled charmingly through an unpracticed speech about the roots of their Italian cooking with a Southern, nose-to-tail twist—essentially, “We were inspired by our mawmaws.”</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">The dishes that followed were more sophisticated: mini duck-ham biscuit sandwiches with hazelnut honey, seared shishito peppers with bits of homemade beef jerky. Short rib with radishes was a little tough, but Brussels sprouts with speck were roasted to peak sweetness in a lovely red casserole. The marrow risotto was one of those genius dishes that makes you wonder why you’ve never seen it before. All this was shared, family style, with a pretty accountant and her app-entrepreneur fiancé at one end of the table, and a banker and his Southern-transplant fashion-publicist girlfriend at the other, all young, all repeat customers. Everyone loved the individual Mason jars layered with whipped salted peanut butter and banana pudding.</p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">Another night, another chef, and there was no getting around eating with your hands. For Butts, Legs, and Sides, Simmons herself prepared an expert bo-ssam feast—crispy-crusted pork shoulder roasted until falling apart, served with fried oysters, kimchi, rice, and a spicy dragon sauce, all to be wrapped in lettuce leaves—followed by a platter of excellent brined, then fried chicken legs and Hoppin’ John fried rice, bright with young ginger, mixed with fluffy scrambled eggs and black-eyed peas.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">City Grit is not a secret, or exclusive—anyone can log onto the Web site and pick a dinner.

The car is because the former glass factory, situated at the mouth of Newtown Creek by the Pulaski Bridge, is nowhere near any subway. The crowd is because the best thing on the menu is a rabbit feast, designed for sharing. For seventy-two dollars—not including Arecibo car-service fares to and from the restaurant—it’s reassuring to see that the dish comes with “the works.” The rabbit is prepared three ways: as chewy kebab-style chunks, for drizzling with a tahini sauce; on a leg bone, well matched with lightly pickled vegetables; and in an umami-rich onion stew, the perfect excuse for eating more “flaky bread,” essentially a paratha that leaves a satisfying film of grease on the fingers.</p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">Glasserie’s convivial ethos feels in keeping with the way we like to eat now: gone is the three-course meal, and, instead, appetizers become entrées, and back again, all of it customizable, rather than dictated by the kitchen. Glasserie also confirms the arrival of health-conscious, vegetable-heavy, pan-Mediterranean food, drawing inspiration from the Middle East and southern Europe, à la “Plenty,” the vegetarian cookbook from the Israeli-born, British-based chef Yotam Ottolenghi. “Plenty,” which is like a “Moosewood” for Millennials, has come to define home cooking for a certain set, yet there are few New York restaurants along the same lines—with the notable exception of Tanoreen, in Bay Ridge, which has been turning out superb Palestinian food from family recipes for fourteen years.</p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">Whole grains (bulgur, wheat berries), nuts, spices, and herbs (saffron, cilantro) dominate, and, for the most part, meat and even fish are used more like condiments. There are nibbles to start (pistachios with kaffir-lime leaf, labneh the consistency of frozen custard, radishes grilled into mellowness and then punctuated with za’atar); a preponderance of small, generally vegetarian plates follow, served in deep white bowls for optimal swirling (a grilled-tomato-and-sweet-corn pudding streaked with Thai basil, new potatoes with Spanish cheese and an egg on top); and then, finally, the glorious rabbit feast, which might be meat’s first appearance of the evening.</p><p data-wc="63" word_count="63">The cocktails can seem phoned in (“Amateur ice,” said one drinker, of his back-of-the-freezer shards), the desserts are not always on the mark (a panna cotta had not entirely set), and the thrifted folding chairs are deeply uncomfortable. But one recent evening the bright glare of a TV shoot out front seemed an appropriate spotlight for a restaurant so confidently of its moment. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="12" word_count="12"><em>Open Wednesdays through Mondays for dinner and weekends for brunch.

Shalom Japan, the name of a new restaurant in South Williamsburg, sounds almost like the punch line to a joke—“A Jewish guy and a Japanese woman walk into a bar . . .”—but the married couple Aaron Israel and Sawako Okochi, the Jewish guy and the Japanese woman who opened the place, are far from kidding around. At its best, their food is fusion in the truest sense, seamless and utterly convincing. Matzah Ball Ramen (trend alert: Dassara, in Carroll Gardens, serves a version as well) belongs in the canon of soup: clear chicken broth; a single, perfect matzo ball; a tangle of springy ramen noodles; fat chunks of carrot, celery, and parsnip; a delicate but explosively flavorful gyoza filled with ground chicken and foie gras; and a tender, tasty coin of chicken <em>char siu</em>, all topped with crunchy yellow mandel, traditional Jewish soup croutons.</p><p data-wc="147" word_count="147"> Beautifully braided miniature challahs, shiny with egg wash and studded with poppy seeds, are made with yeast left over from sake brewing. It’s hard to discern the flavor but fun to know the fact, and the challah is delicious in its own right, especially slathered in butter blended with plump golden raisins that have been rehydrated in sake. In a winning nod to both schmalz herring and sashimi, spot, a small fish caught seasonally near Montauk, is quick-pickled, sliced thick, and served with soy sauce, a shiso leaf, and the fish’s intact skeleton, which is deep-fried and edible, if not particularly satisfying. Not everything quite hits the mark: the dubiously named Jew Egg—like a Scotch egg but embedded in falafel rather than sausage—is clever but underwhelming, and pouches made of <em>aburaage</em> (cold fried tofu skin) don’t exactly jibe with their raclette filling.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">Though Israel and Okochi are serious chefs (they’ve worked, respectively, at Torrisi and Annisa), Shalom Japan maintains a playful spirit. In addition to a high-tech Japanese toilet, the restaurant’s bathroom contains Star of David kosher soap, a book titled “Hibachi Cookery in the American Manner,” and an iconic “You Don’t Have to Be Jewish to Love Levy’s” poster, picturing a Japanese boy holding a sandwich on rye. Cocktails include the Shiksappeal (gin, watermelon, Cocchi Americano, basil) and the Nathan Birnbaum (cold-smoked rye, curaçao, charred-pineapple bitters), which was George Burns’s real name, and the wine list is divided into helpful categories like Spicy Reds and Natty Whites. Dessert is pure fun: sheets of <em>mochi</em> filled with chocolate and vanilla ice cream are a spiffy spin on the blintz, and a grown-up egg cream is made with stout and carbonated milk. Jewish-Japanese—it trips off the tongue. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p class="no-indent" data-wc="9" word_count="9"><small>Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

Recently, a <em>Post</em> reporter wrote a story about her bargain to make three hundred sandwiches in exchange for a marriage proposal from her boyfriend. It went viral. As with a haiku, the strictures for a sandwich are few and straightforward (bread, filling, condiment), the possibilities endless.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Glady’s, a new restaurant in Crown Heights, opened by several Franny’s alums, seems determined to do for the sandwich what Franny’s helped to do for pizza, elevating it from pedestrian fast food to something worth sitting down and waiting for. A meal in the airy turquoise dining room might start with a custom cocktail—the Greenwich Sour, flush with bourbon, lemon, Cointreau, and Lambrusco—and then a bowl of sweet pickled beet, radish, fennel, and egg; generous cuts of glistening lamb pastrami with peach mostarda; and whole roasted carrots with guanciale, hazelnuts, and mascarpone. That’s a tough act to follow, but the sandwiches hold their own, from the healthy-choice Brocc’ Obama, featuring the trendy combination of broccoli and ricotta (plus braised collard greens and mustard vinaigrette), on squishy flauta bread, to the sensory overload of the Abra Kebabra, flatbread stuffed with fatty porchetta, crunchy thrice-cooked French fries, caper mayo, and sweet chili.</p><p data-wc="80" word_count="80">After devastating damage from Hurricane Sandy, followed by months of crowdsourced fund-raising, Court Street Grocers, the Carroll Gardens sandwich counter and specialty market, has opened a second, much smaller outpost, in Red Hook, devoted to heroes. Whereas many sandwich peddlers (for example, the growing empire No. 7 Sub, which has four locations) misguidedly place a premium on shock value (braised short ribs, green peppers, and grape jelly, anyone?), the Hero Shop makes sandwiches that are simply the best versions of themselves.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">The soppressata in its Italian combo—cured meats, three cheeses, arugula, “CSG Hoagie spread”—is not the finest that money can buy, but it’s the one that tastes best with the other ingredients. The owners, the <small>RISD</small> grads Matt Ross and Eric Finkelstein, tried for years to find the ideal vegetables for a sandwich concept that they called the R.P.R.P.—raw, puréed, roasted, pickled—before settling on zucchini, eggplant, fennel, and onion, respectively, finished with fresh herbs. Now known as the Uncle Chucky, after a particularly generous benefactor, it’s a thrilling departure from the usual mush of grilled veggies. But, if a deli is only as good as its egg-and-cheese, Court Street Grocers rules them all with the Mr. Victor: creamy scrambled eggs, melted white Cheddar, arugula, and a split hickory-smoked sausage, on a buttered roll. One of these alone could secure a hand in marriage. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p class="no-indent" data-wc="10" word_count="10"><small>GLADY’S SANDWICHES, $10-$14.

At Uncle Boons, a subterranean den of wood panelling and curated kitsch, the married chef-owners, Matt Danzer and Ann Redding, who met while cooking at Thomas Keller’s Per Se, diversify the repertoire. They decide what goes with what. Fried rice, for example, gets fresh crab—pillowy and sea-salty and comforting—and the deep-brown gravy of a massaman curry is made explicitly for tender beef cheeks. But on a menu full of earthy curiosities—like creamy chicken livers and pineapple cubes, served with sublime roti, and a smoked-catfish-and-pork spread that sounds horrible but tastes wonderful as a dip for market crudités—adventure is its own reward.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">First, there are shandies, betel leaves, and blowfish. Without a hard-liquor license, Danzer and Redding got creative with two drinks that are tailor-made to tame heat: a tamarind shandy (pomelo bitters make it taste like grapefruit beer) and the Hi-So, a galangal-lime-white-wine spritzer. For <em>mieng kum,</em> a common snack in Thailand, betel leaves are topped with mounds of dried shrimp, chiles, and toasted coconut, to be folded, dipped into a galangal sauce, and popped into your mouth. The spicy wraps, which are subject to the availability of betel leaves (these were from Florida), have a darkly vegetal crudeness and bring to mind a giant Thai caterpillar. Blowfish (yes, <em>that</em> blowfish, as in fugu, as in it can kill you) comes grilled, but it’s only the tail, which, the waitress assures you, is not the poisonous part. Turns out it’s just a mild white fish, best enjoyed alongside caramelized grilled octopus.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">Two innocent-looking dishes vie for the title of spiciest: <em>yum kai hua pli</em>, a chicken-and-banana-blossom salad (in coconut-milk dressing, with a slow-building, long-lingering burn), and the lamb <em>laab</em> (designed to set your mouth on fire, mixed with cucumbers and mint, which do nothing to help). The menu plays down the heat factor, and when one waitress took an order for both, she balanced wariness (I don’t want to be blamed if you can’t handle it) with daring (let’s see what you’re made of).</p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">In spite of the owners’ serious culinary pedigree, Uncle Boons has a charmingly unpolished air. The dim lighting and the décor—Thai thrift-shop paintings of pretty ladies and hugging monkeys—add to the festivity, and for now the wait can stretch to an hour. Most people won’t order the blowfish, but some will be pleased to discover that the garlic-and-soy frog legs taste a lot like fried chicken. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><small>OPEN TUESDAYS THROUGH SUNDAYS FOR DINNER.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/chez-jose	Chez José	160 Havemeyer St., Brooklyn	40.7114643	-73.9577637	null	2013/09/30	<p data-wc="169" word_count="169">José Ramírez-Ruiz and Pamela Yung make their own rules. After stints in high-profile kitchens all over New York, the chefs, who are also a couple, decided to jump on the pop-up bandwagon: their food, their life savings, someone else’s space. “If we’re gonna go down, we’re gonna go down doing exactly what we want,” Ramírez-Ruiz said. More than a year later, Chez José, their roving reservation-only restaurant, is thriving. They started out in a South Williamsburg coffee shop, making do with just a hot plate and a small induction oven, then moved around the corner to Lake Trout, a shuttered fish-sandwich shop they’ve left untouched. And so, for now, their elegant, vegetable-focussed tasting menu is served beneath a Dairy Queen-style menu board advertising “cheese fish” and “Western fries.” (Unwitting passersby occasionally bound in hoping for a sandwich.) The walls are faux-wood-panelled; the orange plastic bucket seats are bolted to the floor; the clean but graffitied bathroom is straight out of a dive bar.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">With freedom comes responsibility. Yung and Ramírez-Ruiz work entirely alone, and it’s a small miracle that they manage to serve ten courses—not to mention explain each dish in detail, pour wine (it’s B.Y.O.B.), and bus tables—in between cooking them. One night in late summer, they distributed miniature tumblers of earthy, fragrant chilled tomato-carrot soup, bobbing with cold Sungolds that functioned almost like ice. Bowls of creamy, al-dente risotto came layered with raw mandolined button mushrooms, which cooked gently when bathed, tableside, in molten brown butter. Baskets of warm bread—if Yung is an “accidental baker,” as she puts it, it’s a happy accident—earned a course of their own, showcasing springy sourdough and a decadent green-garlic-nettle brioche, like a savory cinnamon bun.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">A few weeks later, tender sweet-potato leaves were fashioned into hand rolls and filled with sweet-potato purée, crisp heirloom apple, and a medley of crunchy seeds. Tangy buttermilk panna cotta, topped with tomatoes confited in caramel-vanilla vinegar and cracked-open figs, successfully pushed the boundaries of dessert. Because they’re harder to source sustainably, meat and fish appear sparingly at Chez José, but Ramírez-Ruiz and Yung are hardly animal averse. In summer, they host a Sunday pig roast in the backyard of a Williamsburg bar, allowing participants to choose their own cuts. Here’s hoping they continue doing exactly what they want. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><small>OPEN TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS FOR DINNER. PRIX-FIXE $55.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/23/luksus	Luksus	615 Manhattan Ave., Brooklyn 	40.72339975	-73.9508191144917	718-389-6034	2013/09/23	<p data-wc="140" word_count="140">What is currently New York’s only beer-tasting menu is served in the back room of a pub in the heart of Polish Greenpoint. Inevitably, it attracts beer fanatics from all over, but there are just twenty-six seats—along with three cooks, and, on any given night, five beers. The first is often It’s Alive! Rhubarb, a sour Belgian ale brewed for Luksus by the cult Copenhagen brewer Mikkeller. On a recent evening, a craft-beer novice said that it tasted a little like grownup Martinelli, but was careful to whisper, because the other twenty-five diners had adopted a hushed reverence—the kind that comes with an extremely competitive reservations process and a long pilgrimage involving the G train. In an era of unprecedented restaurant din, “Have you read ‘The Corrections’?” was the only overheard remark of the three-hour meal.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">Unusually, there is no sense of slog in the tasting menu, no wave of terror with the petits fours that the night will never end and that you’ll still be hungry when it finally does. Perhaps that’s because the food is unexpected and elegant. It comes from Daniel Burns, formerly of Momofuku’s R. &amp; D. test kitchen and the renowned Copenhagen restaurant Noma. When you sit down, the waitstaff bring the fanciest bar snacks you’re likely to find. There’s a marinated chicken oyster, wrapped in a little leaf of braised cabbage smeared with eggplant purée, and fried cipollini onions, for dipping in a sweet buttermilk dressing: an elevated take on tacos and French onion dip. What could be better drinking food?</p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">The next course, a beef tartare, is heartier, to accompany a dark ale with a farmhouse funk from the Belgian brewery Hof ten Dormaal. There’s a chip of dehydrated caramelized onion and roasted chicken stock on the side, rich in explosive umami flavor. Little Gem, the surprise “it” lettuce of the summer, comes roasted, in a beautiful but impractical bowl from the Danish potter that supplies Noma. It is too deep to allow effective cutting—or to mix in the egg that comes on top.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">Like the room, all blond Scandinavian timber, Burns’s cooking has a sparseness; this is earthy food that functions as the straight man to adventurous, even weird beers. There’s a dessert you’ll wish Häagen-Dazs would put in a tub: a blueberry-and-wintergreen sorbet, swirled with corn ice cream, rife with chunks of blueberry cookie dough. It’s served with a Berliner Weisse called Justin Blåbær, which has been aged in brunello barrels. Blueberry cookie dough and glass-bottle soda to match: this is what you imagined adulthood would be. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p><p data-wc="10" word_count="10"><em>Open for dinner Tuesdays through Fridays.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/16/atrium-2	Atrium	15 Main St., Brooklyn 	40.7036006875	-73.9905581875	718-858-1095	2013/09/16	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="156" word_count="156">A meal at Atrium might start with an olive-oil cocktail and oysters, followed by quinoa two ways and a sweet-corn panna cotta. Modern Mediterranean, maybe a little trend-obsessed. But this new restaurant in Dumbo, opened by a team of DB Bistro alums, is also an act of defiance against nature. It’s located around the corner from the carrousel in Brooklyn Bridge Park, which was engulfed by the East River during Hurricane Sandy, a moment captured in a now iconic photograph that showed the hooves of the glittering horses threatened by water and surrounded by darkness. The photo presaged the havoc Sandy would inflict on the Brooklyn waterfront and its businesses. In Dumbo alone, the River Café, the bobbing grande dame of the borough’s dining scene, was shut for many months (and is now open only for private events), and Governor closed for good. It was promising and ambitious and lived where Atrium does now.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">Although the space remains slightly awkward—the downstairs feels too big, the mezzanine like exile—the vertical garden, which covers an entire wall, lifts it from generic industrial and imparts a pleasantly indoors-outdoors feel. Atrium has aspirations beyond a neighborhood joint. Though friendly, there’s a Manhattan-like formality to the service, down to the whispered deliberations between hosts about seating arrangements, and the wine list has over two hundred selections, though only one rosé.</p><p data-wc="147" word_count="147">Certainly the menu doesn’t offer the kind of casual fare the residents of this restaurant-starved area might want to eat on a Tuesday night: there’s no burger, for instance, but there is a veal-chop special, served with pre-recession quantities of shaved truffle. Many of the dishes are downright heavy, oddly wintery for an end-of-summer meal by the water. Which is not to say that the results aren’t frequently, even disconcertingly, satisfying. Just in case sweetbreads weren’t rich enough, at Atrium they’re served with chanterelles and chorizo; a bone-marrow appetizer comes scraped out and ground up with anchovies. It’s irresistible, almost obscenely salty, but the preparation does strange things to the texture of the marrow, which is no longer appealingly viscous but more like taco beef. A salad of bitter greens and beets, balanced and harmonious, comes with pickled, not fresh, berries.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">The most interesting dish on the menu is that quinoa, which comes with starchy, hearty cauliflower. It appears in two ways: turned into a grainy, chewy tagliatelle, and with the kernels themselves toasted, as a topping. There are cumin seeds, too, so the over-all effect is a bounty of crunchy little orbs and noodles swimming in a velvety, lemon-scented, cauliflower cream sauce: a savory take on cereal and milk. It’s good now, and it will be even better later in the year, when the weather turns, and the puffy coats come out. (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $16-$34.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/09/umami-burger	Umami Burger	432 Sixth Ave. 	53.7558567	-1.4654847	212-677-8626	2013/09/09	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="116" word_count="116">It’s a risky move, opening a burger joint in a burger town. Like its pizza and its bagels, New York’s most beloved burgers are diverse and many-numbered, each with devoted multitudes. It’s downright bold to open a burger joint that purports to blow them all out of the water. “New York has some O.K. burgers,” Adam Fleischman said last spring, before launching the first East Coast outpost of his popular California restaurant, Umami Burger, in Greenwich Village. His would be better, thanks to his focus on ramping up the umami flavor (the hard-to-pinpoint fifth taste, after sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, best exemplified by MSG) in almost every component of his sandwiches.</p><p data-wc="163" word_count="163">For the first couple weeks after the restaurant débuted, in July, New Yorkers had to wait for up to three hours to put Fleischman to the test, but the hype has since died down, and it now takes about forty-five minutes to get a table. Fleischman insists that each branch of Umami Burger (there are seventeen in California and one in Florida) is unique. But if walking into one Umami Burger isn’t exactly like walking into another, it is certainly reminiscent of walking into any chain eatery. The menus are large and laminated; the paper placemats are stamped with an icon that looks like both a lipstick kiss and a burger; the servers wear T-shirts emblazoned with the cheesy mottoes “Eating is believing” and “East meats West.” The cocktail list, featuring more than a dozen mostly fruity concoctions with names like the BobCat (for the N.Y.U. mascot) and the Big Apple, is essentially an advertisement for Absolut and Bacardi.</p><p data-wc="223" word_count="223">The distinction lies in the food. Waste no time with “Greens”—the underdressed Umami Caesar will only disappoint. (If you must have a vegetable, the pickle plate, with brightly colored okra, beets, and green beans, is excellent.) Fries are, for some reason, listed as a starter, and the waitstaff seem determined to serve them as such. It’s hard to find fault with them otherwise: they’re thin, crispy, and perfectly salted, in the McDonald’s image. But you came here to eat meat: freshly ground Wagyu beef formed into loose six-ounce patties, cooked medium rare (“Is that O.K.?” the servers ask, rhetorically), then sandwiched into brioche-like buns branded with the letter “U.” With little exception, they are supremely delicious, each juicy, messy bite enhanced by a carefully chosen combination of toppings. Both the Original (crisp Parmesan wafer, shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, and roasted tomato) and the Truffle (truffle glaze, truffle cheese, and a slather of roasted-garlic aioli) are said to pack extra “serious Umami Burger flavor,” and they are, indeed, particularly satisfying. For a more refined experience, ask for the off-menu 5 Spice Duck Burger, a subtler but exceptional composition of ground breast and leg topped with chutney and roasted fennel, suggestive of a Chinese bao.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/02/corvo-bianco	Corvo Bianco	446 Columbus Ave. 	41.1526178181818	-83.4047562272727	212-595-2624	2013/09/02	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="89" word_count="89">If anyone has ever asked what a Negroni made without gin tastes like, they can drink the answer at Corvo Bianco, a new modern Italian bar and restaurant on the Upper West Side. Apart from the “classic”—gin, sweet vermouth, Campari—there is a “smoky” one, made with rum, and the vodka-based “angelo.” It’s hard to reinvent perfection, though: while both variations end with that astringent, pleasantly medicinal taste of vermouth, what’s absent is that sweet, flowery, English-garden quality. These cocktails feel like shortcuts, rather than rambles.</p><p data-wc="145" word_count="145">But maybe that’s beside the point, since the bar area—distinct from the cavernous restaurant in the back—is filled with people who just seem anxious for a drink. Judging by the preponderance of women in halter tops and nervy solo guys checking their Blackberries, Corvo Bianco is a favorite choice for Match.com meet-ups, perhaps because it’s one of the few places in the neighborhood approximating the high-decibel, hostess-table experience of a downtown boîte. And even if the bar feels a little like a hotel lobby (this was once the Endicott), the dining room really is stunning. There is a tree suspended in wire, a vaulted glass ceiling, and a dramatic brick arch that may as well be Etruscan. The décor says: do not expect chicken parmigiana, or anything resembling red-sauce fare. Do not even expect gin in your Negroni.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">Instead, Elizabeth Falkner, who conquered Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn last year with artful kale salads and prosciutto pizzas at Krescendo, is aiming for something considerably more sophisticated, with dishes drawn from the coastal regions of Italy. (For the record, there is a meatball pizza on the bar menu, albeit on flatbread.) As with those cocktails, the food sometimes suffers from an excess of ambition. Burrata, which is so inherently delightful that any amount of fuss seems too much, came scattered with crunchy crumbs resembling savory granola; these turned out to be “black garlic pan grattato.” A fava-and-corn bruschetta was overwhelmed by pepper, and the squid-ink trenette, only sparsely populated with sea urchin, had all of the gluiness you’d expect, without any of the mysterious funkiness. </p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">Falkner was originally a pastry chef, and the desserts here seem more attended-to than the rest of the meal. They are daring, even avant-garde. Grilled peaches, for instance, are served with an aggressively salty brown-butter almond cake, corn gelato, and a syrup made from anise hyssop, more licorice than mint. It’s the most exciting dish of the night, and tastes disconcertingly like an entire brunch menu on one plate. The deconstructed “cheesecake” is more familiar territory, but on the side is “blueberry paper,” which looks like a fruit roll-up but is hard like toffee. These dishes might divide your table—there will be some who do not care to experience fennel or fernet in their desserts—but at least there’s no flourless chocolate cake. It’s too bad that Corvo Bianco’s most compelling icebreaker comes at the end of the evening. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $24-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/08/26/the-elm	The Elm	160 N. 12th St., Brooklyn 	40.72088455	-73.9555734045708	718-218-1088	2013/08/26	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="103" word_count="103">It might take a moment to shift gears after the walk—past a concrete expanse of McCarren Park, rife with weed (both kinds), dumpsters, and a row of outhouses—to the King &amp; Grove hotel, in whose basement Paul Liebrandt’s new enterprise, the Elm, has taken up residence. The concept: haute cuisine gone casual. But, located just down the block from the ultra-chic Wythe hotel, where Reynard has set the cool-Williamsburg-restaurant bar very high, the Elm, with its emphasis on complex, precisely composed dishes, seems more like the geeky smart kid cocky in the knowledge that his S.A.T. scores precede him.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">The media-savvy Liebrandt has relinquished his post at the widely acclaimed Corton, the restaurant that made him a contender, and is attempting to create a brand. (A documentary was made about him in 2011, his memoir comes out in December, and there’s a cookbook and a signature restaurant in the works.) But Liebrandt has no interest in quelling his experimental spirit, and, in inverse proportion to his surroundings, he’s not afraid to stay fancy. A meal starts with an amuse-bouche (a black-olive financier that tastes like a lemon poppy-seed muffin) and ends with petits fours (crazy-good smoky chocolate-chip blondies). An appetizer of fois gras has a top layer of intensely strawberry-flavored gelée; almond cream, tristar strawberries, and candied ginger make the dish a party.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">But Chef can go too far. Creamy lime-and-salt-accented avocado soup improves on guacamole; it doesn’t need the buttons of coconut-cream-encased baby shrimp and the curried cashews. Superbly tender duck breast is cut into tiny parallelograms, crisp on top and glazed with honey-duck jus, but the turnips next door are a comedown, and the portion of duck is so small it’s stressful. The “Share” category on the menu offers some consolation: Chicken “Kiev Style” is not breaded but covered with crispy skin. It’s stuffed with copious amounts of herb butter and served, awkwardly, as two lonely hunks sitting in a large dry Dutch oven, with a separate plate of condiments that includes an entire bulb of roasted garlic. The side of luscious potatoes Aligot, whipped with Comté cheese, makes up for everything.</p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">Liebrandt clearly loves to deliver a “wow” factor, and “Summer Garden,” on the share menu, has it. One night, a waiter described the dish as “forty to sixty fruits and vegetables,” and left it at that. What arrived looked like salad in a pot, but closer inspection revealed a vast, delicate jumble of miniature foliage, each element prepared for optimal effect—fresh herbs, al-dente carrots, golden beets, sweet summer tomatoes. There were, indeed, too many to count, and it made one feel like a blissfully ignorant lucky rabbit. (Open every day for breakfast and dinner. Dishes $15-$25; dishes to share $48-$56.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

The concept behind <strong>Hybird</strong>, the slick takeout counter that is the buzziest of the market’s recent additions, isn’t fresh (who’s not hawking “gourmet fast food for the eclectic palate”?), but the man behind it is. After losing a fried-chicken competition to Momofuku’s David Chang on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,” Ahmir (Questlove) Thompson, the drummer and leader of Fallon’s house band, the Roots, has perfected his recipe and teamed up with the Philadelphia restaurateur Stephen Starr.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">For Questlove, “chicken and dumplings” means not a Southern stew but drumsticks and potstickers, filled with unlikely ingredients like tofu and truffled egg. The chicken is juicy and flavorful, its skin satisfyingly crisp and craggy, if a bit too peppery, and it pairs surprisingly well with the dumplings—particularly the Cheesed &amp; Chard, stuffed with vibrant greens and mascarpone. For dessert, there are cupcakes—just when you thought the trend was exhausted, enter Beyond the Pineapple, whose savory red-curry icing is truly unusual.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">The clear standout on the menu, however, is the watermelon-jalapeño slushy: the definition of refreshing, with a bonus bracing kick. At the very least, sip one while waiting in the long line for <strong>Los Tacos No. 1</strong>, immediately next door. This tiny taquería, the brainchild of one Tiajuanan and two Californians, boasts an authoritative air of authenticity, the short-order team slinging their product at a head-spinning pace, filling house-made tortillas and folding them into paper cones with a flick of the wrist. When the guy behind the register insists that your quesadilla <em>especial</em> be filled with carne asada, it’s wise to heed his advice. It amounts to a giant deep-fried empanada, the blistered exterior giving way to a mouthwatering meld of Jack cheese and marinated steak, impossible to stop eating even though you know you should.</p><p data-wc="66" word_count="66">Across the cobblestones, fine dining awaits at <strong>Cull &amp; Pistol</strong>, a charming sit-down restaurant from the owners of the Lobster Place, the market’s veritable seafood department store. Lobster is the main attraction here, served in a giant steaming cauldron, nestled with mussels, sausage, and corn on the cob, or in an exemplary Connecticut-style lobster roll, slathered in drawn butter and plated with thin-cut “New Bay” fries.</p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">The most transportative dish—aside, perhaps, from raw oysters that taste like gulps of fresh seawater—is the Long Island clam toast: two thick slices of grilled ciabatta spread with aïoli and crowded with plump, briny littlenecks flecked with parsley and tasso ham from Dickson’s Farmstand Meats, just down the way. Close your eyes—now, or when you’re served a tiny cup of orange-creamsicle gelato at the end of the meal—and you’re in Montauk. (Open every day. Hybird, chicken starts at $3 for a drumstick and $7 for dumplings; Los Tacos No. 1, tacos and plates $2.50-$5; Cull &amp; Pistol, entrées $18-$26.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

(It was most recently Nolita House, a comfort-food standby.) Mattos left Taavo Somer’s Isa last year, owing to artistic differences—the chef was pioneering avant-garde dishes like “calamari, ink, pil pil, dill” and “porridge”; Somer wanted meatballs and kale pizza. At Estela, Mattos has loosened up. Gone is the austere air of mystery—the menu, while spare, has prepositions and conjunctions—and the food on the plate is not just recognizable but decadent and delicious.</p><p data-wc="133" word_count="133"> Mattos’s menu, which changes daily, is dominated by snacks and appetizers, like the plate of Olli’s ham from Virginia—thin and silky, less salty and more luscious than prosciutto—or cured hunks of sardine, meaty as mackerel, served with matzo flatbread. For those who can’t get enough burrata, there is a sublimely creamy one here, and on a recent night it was made even more romantic with Maldon-style salt flakes, radish, and lovage. Beef tartare with pickled elderberries and tiny fried sunchoke chips erred on the sweet side. But poached egg with gigante beans, shaved cured tuna, and bread crumbs became a dreamy, umami-rich bean soup upon stirring. An elegant yellow chrysanthemum meticulously fashioned from raw baby-squash circles gave way to layers of anise-flavored hyssop leaves and bright-pink yuzu-cured trout. </p><p data-wc="65" word_count="65">Once the main courses arrive, it’s a surprise to find out that skirt steak is a match made in heaven with anchovies and charred eggplant. Of the three desserts, the honey panna cotta with Moscato vinegar was the winner, even if the friendly proprietor who delivered it had tasted the same dish at Franny’s the night before and worried that theirs was better.</p><p data-wc="177" word_count="177">All this kitchen avidity competes somewhat with the aggressive drinks program. Thomas Carter, a former sommelier at Blue Hill Stone Barns and a co-owner of Estela, has put together an outsized wine list—ten pages, including four Grüner Veltliners for more than a hundred dollars each—that seems like overkill for a menu with just four entrées. Cocktails like the Valuable Lesson (a Negroni homage, with rum, Campari, Madeira, and an orange peel the size of a Post-it) and the perfumed Rosemary Society (gin, pear brandy, lemon, grapefruit, rosemary) go down easily. The bartenders are sly and formidable in their knowledge of spirits, if unmindful of the fact that they are standing in a site that played a key role in downtown New York’s glorious gritty past. When a Gen X patron recalled coming to the space when it was the original home of the Knitting Factory, then noted that CBGB is looking to relocate, the Gen Y bartender mused aloud, “Just let it go.” (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/abc-cocina	Abc Cocina	38 E. 19th St. 	42.3310203	-83.0824228	212-677-2233	2013/07/29	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="153" word_count="153">It seemed a preposterous idea from the restaurant proprietor Jean-Georges Vongerichten: a slightly spartan, vegetable-centric restaurant in the dark, low-ceilinged recesses of an upscale furniture store in the Flatiron district. But when ABC Kitchen opened, in 2010, the shiny veneer of health imparted by the chef Dan Kluger’s cleverly seasonal menu made it one of the city’s most popular restaurants. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before Vongerichten and Kluger took Kitchen’s savvy, snacky sensibility one step further and opened a tapas joint. After all, they didn’t need to look far: their new place, ABC Cocina, has taken over the old Pipa space, also associated with ABC Carpet &amp; Home, one street up from Kitchen. Gone are Pipa’s heavy wooden chairs and non-ironic chandeliers; the warehouse-like room is now decorated in adherence to the quintessentially noughties philosophy that if something can be made of Lucite it should be.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">ABC Cocina’s Web site studiously avoids making claims that the food is from any particular place—instead, the restaurant is a “modern global exchange,” which means that the sizable bar can serve sangria, margaritas, and caipirinhas. As is always the case with margaritas, you will order one of the fancy ones, seduced by the promise of basil and grapefruit and guajillo, but will discover, fifteen dollars later, that the best of the lot is the good old classic. There are two kinds of sangria. Surprisingly, the white one, made with passion fruit, is not too sweet, and actually tastes like wine, not cordial. The caipirinha on a recent evening was made with strawberries from the Union Square farmer’s market, mint from the roof, and, a waiter proudly announced, no added grain sugar.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">The price of the tacos has attracted some consternation online. They vary in quality. The fourteen-dollar glazed-short-rib taco, for instance, is served with frizzled red onions, bullies of the vegetable world that inevitably overpower both the short rib and the accompaniments (in this case, a habanero relish). The chef explained that the slider taco came from an initial thought that a burger was needed on the menu; later, he turned the Wagyu patties into taco meat and drizzled yellow secret sauce on top.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">The unevenness of the menu seems to arise from an impulse to make everything seasonal, even if it doesn’t suit the dish. You might wonder why the perfectly good guacamole needs to be topped with sweet peas and sunflower seeds, but then marvel at the light, bright sugar-snap-pea salad, which is tossed with a house-made sour cream. There’s also an outstanding raw shaved-fluke appetizer, made up of ribbons of fish and mint, crunchy puffed rice, and a tangy green-chili dressing. Under “rice” is the restaurant’s crown jewel: a rousing rendition of <em>arroz con pollo</em>, with plenty of glistening crackling skin and just enough lemon zest. You will enjoy it the next day as leftovers, because it’s a mountain of rice, and it will taste even better for breakfast. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Plates $7-$24.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/22/the-cleveland	The Cleveland	25 Cleveland Pl. 	40.60302715	-74.0684726420495	212-274-0900	2013/07/22	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="142" word_count="142">Though it is situated on a distinctly urban block, just up the street from Mexican Radio and across scrubby Petrosino Square from La Esquina, the Cleveland, unlike those other two Nolita eateries, offers an almost pastoral dining experience. The most obvious explanation is the lovely back garden, a serene space bordered by beds of lavender and leafy heucheras, shaded by striped umbrellas and brightened at night by strings of amber lights. Its quirky aesthetic touches are more English country cottage than slick downtown boîte: whitewashed brick walls, a bar made from rustic pine and zinc, a macchiato that arrived on a saucer with a ceramic green frog rising up off its lip. But what really brings the flavor of flora to the Cleveland is the cuisine: on a menu that shifts with the seasons, vegetables are the stars of the show.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">A bulgur salad with eggplant, water spinach, and red peppers looked like a delicious box of crayons. Kale with apples and bacon was such a treat it was hard to remember that it was (mostly) healthy. A dish of lentils with duck confit was good, but what really elevated the dish were the slices of caramelized onion that came with it. It isn’t that the Cleveland forgoes fauna. They do an excellent skirt steak, and it happens to come with trumpet mushrooms, asparagus, sliced snap peas, and okra—a welcome change from the usual pile of potatoes. The roasted half chicken was golden and savory, but what made it memorable was the mixture underneath, of sumac, kale, chickpeas, and quinoa flavored with the Middle Eastern spice blend of basil, thyme, oregano, and sesame seeds called zatar.</p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">Even the best desserts have a hint of the garden—there’s a carrot-chocolate biscotti and an olive-oil cake with a green sprig parked in a sidecar of mascarpone. Of course, this cultivated bucolic mien runs the risk of seeming affected and twee. But the Cleveland escapes that by keeping the music gritty, loud, and old-school. It’s a rocking garden party, indoors and out. (Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $18-$29.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/08/antica-pesa	Antica Pesa	115 Berry St., Brooklyn 	40.7188295	-73.95865	347-763-2635	2013/07/08	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="123" word_count="123">The original Antica Pesa, in Rome’s Trastevere neighborhood, is one of those quaint little family-owned restaurants with a celebrity following (according to press reports, Quentin Tarantino likes the <em>cacio e pepe</em>). At its new Williamsburg location, the décor is slick: mod white light fixtures, huge leather couches, roaring fireplace. The crowd—when it does not include Madonna and her backup dancers, who stopped by recently, according to Page Six—usually has a fair number of tourists, plus some young professionals and European party people. A jazz band sometimes plays. For the disoriented: you’re not in Rome, or a midtown hotel. This is the new new Williamsburg—of the coming Whole Foods, the megaclubs, and the glass condos on the waterfront.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">The most ambitious thing about Antica Pesa may be its pricing: eighteen-dollar appetizers, twenty-eight-dollar entrées, and, on the wine list, an eleven-hundred-dollar bottle of Barbaresco. The formula resembles that of Manhattan power-lunch spots like Casa Lever, with a variation: instead of serving traditional Italian food in a modern setting, the owners have taken traditional Roman food and attempted to modernize it. The effect is not always Lever level. One night, a fifteen-dollar appetizer was billed as a “trip through the Italian countryside.” It turned out to be chunks of cheese, slices of salami, and a single breadstick draped with bresaola ham, in individual vessels that looked like ashtrays. In another appetizer, eggplant slices are fried and then wedged, vertically, into a loglike schmear of mascarpone and ricotta cheese. The effect is decadent without being especially flavorful—it tastes like cream-cheese-dipped potato chips.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">Antica Pesa’s better moments come when it sticks to more traditional pastas. The <em>cacio e pepe</em>—Tarantino’s jam—is creamy and firm. The pasta all’Amatriciana gets an extra kick of oil, served by an attentive waiter (“You like hot sauce, ladies?”), plus hot red pepper, snipped tableside with what look like nail clippers. But things go off the rails again with the entrées. The lamb chops, which the servers keep telling you about, are refreshingly simple but a little greasy. Baccalà alla Romana (salt cod) resembles a bland fish goulash, more salt than fish. The description of the <em>maialino porchetta e ovetto</em> (“pork loin, slow-cooked pork belly, fluffy egg white, marinated egg yolks, and asparagus”) promises so much. The reality: a light but tasteless pile of egg whites and pork that is somehow both undercooked and a little rubbery.</p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">There are bright spots in the service, and the blingy atmosphere is a welcome deviation from Brooklyn clichés—who needs another faux-rustic farm-to-table establishment? You could have a good, if overpriced, meal here if you stuck to wine, pasta, and gelato—try the blueberry sorbet (pure and tart). But, for the most part, the restaurant tracks pretty well with Williamsburg’s real-estate market: it may look like Manhattan—and cost almost as much—but it’s still experiencing growing pains. (Open every night for dinner. Entrées $21-$30.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/01/alder-2	Alder	157 Second Ave. 	51.8250795	1.2413677	212-539-1900	2013/07/01	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="177" word_count="177">“Nothing’s what it seems” is a guiding principle at the restaurants of Wylie Dufresne, the mad-scientist “Top Chef” Master behind the Lower East Side’s wd-50 and now Alder, a new “pub” in the East Village. At Alder, certain dishes express this maxim obviously, with scare quotes. The “potato chips” that accompany a wavelike smear of purple pub cheese (aged Cheddar, cream cheese, mustard, and port wine) are actually pieces of Martin’s potato bread, flattened and baked to a crunch; the “oyster crackers” that come with a decadent, silky clam chowder are real oysters, dehydrated and fried to a crackle. Other plates are just composed so artfully that their ingredients become unrecognizable, and you might have to ask the server to remind you what you ordered—as in the case of the foie-gras terrine, which comes embedded in a rind of poached apple to create what looks almost like a slice of grapefruit. Served atop chartreuse yogurt on an English muffin and jewelled with delicate herb leaves, it’s part breakfast sandwich, part elaborate pastry.</p><p data-wc="133" word_count="133">What’s most surprising, however, is not the big reveal—it’s that, by and large, these flashy, self-conscious innovations actually taste good, like real food. “Pigs in a blanket”—segments of Chinese sausage encased in crisp, compressed hot-dog bun and carefully arranged on a slab of slate alongside dots of spicy Japanese mustard and sweet-chili sauce—are as addictive as the original, but better, and manage to pay homage to the egg roll, too. Fried quail, which by some kitchen trick arrives in juicy, boneless coins marbled with fat, is perfectly offset by a mash of banana curry, dollops of pickled turmeric, and a single, elegant stalk of Chinese broccoli. Ethereally textured, pale-pink smoked Arctic char, served with al-dente berbere lentils, apricot, and Napa cabbage, will make you forget salmon ever existed.</p><p data-wc="162" word_count="162">Not every dish is a home run—the oxtail stew is surprisingly bland—and some choices are questionable. It’s unclear why, for example, a bowl of giardiniera appears on every table: there’s not a single thing on the menu that would benefit from it. And charging five dollars for “unlimited fizzy water” seems a bit inhospitable for a place that, despite its celebrity-chef allure and austere, gray-toned aesthetic, manages to feel pretty laid back and welcoming. But dessert is delightful—especially vanilla ice cream drizzled in red-pepper oil and a root-beer pudding that magically captures the flavor of float foam—and the drinks are genuinely unusual, a remarkable feat in this golden age of mixology. The St. Marks the Spot, a frothy orange mix of carrot juice, sea buckthorn, and aquavit, garnished with a birch-patterned cardboard straw, is as virtuous as a cocktail can get—in spite of the liquor, it tastes positively healthy. (Open daily for dinner. Dishes $9-$23.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/lafayette	Lafayette	380 Lafayette St. 	41.64611925	-83.53903871875	212-533-3000	2013/06/24	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="119" word_count="119">Andrew Carmellini, the chef at Lafayette, is famous for creating restaurants that are scene-y, but which also serve food you will find yourself telling your friends about. First there was A Voce, near Madison Square Park, at which New Yorkers seemed to discover ricotta for the first time, and then a similar thing happened at the Dutch, in SoHo, with pie. At Locanda Verde, in Tribeca, which opened four years ago, it’s still impossible to get a reservation that isn’t for 5:30 or 10 <small>P.M.</small> And now that there are more trendy French restaurants than Italian ones opening downtown for the first time since the mid-nineties, Lafayette has emerged as the grandest and most convincing of the bunch.</p><p data-wc="167" word_count="167">The room, all soaring ceilings and oversized windows, has a lot to do with it: this was once Chinatown Brasserie, the site of so many elaborate office parties in pre-recession boom times. As with Carmellini’s earlier ventures, there’s an immediate sense of excitement and occasion about the place. Notably, there’s no such thing as a bad seat. Waiting for a table at the cheery side bar, backlit in glowing amber, you should ask for the spectacular Asterix Elixir, made with <em>herbes de Provence</em>, gin, yellow chartreuse, and egg whites. The egg whites are shaken into a foamy head, which makes the gin-and-chartreuse combination as refreshing as a cold beer. (Sensible drinkers will pair it with the Egg Lafayette, a kind of haute devilled egg made with smoked sablefish and trout caviar.) Once you’re at a table, there’s a diverting parade of affluence to observe, as pyramids of <em>fruits de mer</em> and macarons with birthday sparklers on top pass by with startling frequency.</p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">It’s easy to spend a lot of money at Lafayette, and the busy, oversized menu of bistro classics encourages ambitious orders (there was for a time an entire section devoted to potatoes). But the portions are generous—nine slices of duck breast, ringed with bacon, to one entrée order—and the superlative bread, baked in house and sold in the adjoining boulangerie, is free. It’s moist, dense, and entirely shardless, and, thankfully, the restaurant knows the limits of authenticity, because the butter is on the right side of melting. Almost everything that follows reaches the same heights of casual perfection: a duck-mousse tartine topped with walnuts and shiny cherry slices; velvety baby scallops served in a giant scallop shell, marinated, Tostitos-style, with a hint of lime; a beef tartare that is chunky, not chewy, with a thick disk of poached marrow on top; and asparagus, neither woody nor stringy, served with a cube of trotter on the side. The preponderance of italicized French sauces on the menu—<em>Véronique, aigrelette, bagnettou</em>—speaks to the seriousness of the kitchen, but to be in the light-filled dining room on a balmy summer’s evening is an exercise in pure pleasure. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $22-$36.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/10/melibea	Melibea	2 Bank St. 	47.500049	8.7258461	212-463-0090	2013/06/10	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="128" word_count="128">The best thing to eat at Melibea, a pan-Mediterranean restaurant in the West Village, is called “study of tomato.” It’s a salad of raw and fried tomatoes drizzled with very good olive oil, not nearly as intimidating as it sounds. Though there are some cubes of tomato jelly, there’s not much to it, except that the chef, Jesús Núñez, of Barraca, the popular tapas place around the corner, has somehow found the type of tomatoes that you previously thought existed only at a Long Island farm stand in August. They’re so juicy they resemble peaches, and, as if to preëmpt any confusion, Núñez has written the word “tomato” in dehydrated tomato dust on the side of the dish, in breezy italics.</p><p data-wc="208" word_count="208">Núñez is having a lot of fun at Melibea—and you will, too. His menu is a greatest hits of the Mediterranean songbook: moussaka, osso buco, goulash, bouillabaisse. Rather than follow the farm-to-table trend, Núñez is hosting a seventies-themed dinner party, executed with more than a little kitsch. (It’s nice to think that the flamenco-dance music playing on repeat is a nod to Lips, the drag cabaret venue that occupied the same space for two decades, but it probably isn’t.) The menu adopts a dramatic flair: tiramisu is described as “a classic transformed,” and another dessert is given the grand title “One Thousand and One Nights”—dates, rose-blossom ice cream, and, perhaps inevitably, a syrup-soaked pastry nest. But as with those tomatoes, the best dishes are simple in composition. When asked for a recommendation, the solicitous and abundant waitstaff will point to the first item on the menu, which is hummus. This is no ordinary hummus, they’ll say, which is a tough sell with Taïm so nearby. But they turn out to be right: in addition to its unusual toppings of sesame seeds and beet dust, some of the chickpeas are fried before blending, making for a richer, smokier, almost meaty taste.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">The focaccia served before the meal may be authentically stale, like at a tourist trap in a Spanish fishing village. And all that might be said about the mysterious “African syrup” in an admittedly delicious cava-and-cherry-tomato concoction is that it contains cinnamon and bay leaf. But it’s bound to be relaxing to sit in an elegant walnut-panelled room, on a beautiful tree-lined block, and eat a lamb tajine with a spoon. The waiters wear starched shirts, share plates are changed promptly after each course, and obvious attention has been paid to the prettiness of every dish. Melibea is the kind of place where instead of asking in a suspicious tone if your party is complete, the host ushers you to a red banquette and hands you a cocktail menu. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $24-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/03/hanjan	Hanjan	36 W. 26th St. 	37.8192238	-122.2849822	212-206-7226	2013/06/03	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="90" word_count="90">A menu that features chicken wings, braised pigs’ feet, and barbecue might sound par for the course on a Flatiron block that’s already home to Hill Country and the Hog Pit. But Hanjan serves down-home cuisine of a different variety, updating the rustic fare of the <em>joomak</em>, the traditional Korean tavern. Behind the wood-clad exterior, the chef, Hooni Kim, serves pub grub with a pedigree: before setting out on his own, Kim worked in the kitchens at Daniel and Masa, and his first restaurant, Danji, earned a Michelin star.</p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">As folks might say at the Hog Pit, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and Kim repeats Danji’s winning formula here—small plates, small room, minimalist décor, menus tucked into drawers at your table. Hanjan saves most of its fifty seats for walk-ins, and by seven o’clock on a recent Monday night the bar at the front, the long communal table behind it, and the two banquettes lining the walls were already packed. But the wait passes quickly with friendly service and cocktails, like the addictive Korean Spice, a twist on a classic margarita, made with lime juice, chile-infused tequila, and agave, served in a glass rimmed with sea salt and red pepper flakes.</p><p data-wc="205" word_count="205">The menu opens with traditional dishes, notably a smoky, soy-glazed half mackerel and a radish-kimchi-and-brisket fried rice that’s as silky as any risotto. Modern options include fried chicken, which arrived tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, with a salt-to-spice ratio so ideal it could put a Kentucky colonel to shame. The boneless morsels are served with pickled Korean green peppers, which lend a bright kick, and cool shreds of daikon. But the best dish may be the delicate pork trotters, sliced thin and braised to a fragrant complexity with an Asian five-spice mixture. Order more than one plate to stave off any squabbles over last bites. Not every dish at Hanjan will please every palate. Opinions were divided on a scallion pancake studded with nuggets of local squid. One diner praised her forkful as hearty, while a neighbor rejected his as greasy and dense. And one persnickety eater dismissed the beef galbi skewers (two to an order) as merely “pedestrian.” Chef Kim may have the last laugh on that one—the food peddlers hawking street meat in countryside markets are one of his influences. (Open Mondays through Saturdays from 6 to midnight, and from 5:30 to 1 <small>A.M.</small> at the bar. Dishes $4-$22.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the men behind the super-deli Torrisi Italian Specialties, spent a year touring the five boroughs’ classic red-sauce restaurants to round up the ingredients of a high-toned homage. An Elio’s for downtown, you might say. They were looking not only for culinary secrets and delights but also for what Carbone has called “moves”—endearing idiosyncratic gestures that turn service into performance and tops into tips. They brought all this to a Thompson Street space that had belonged, for decades, to Rocco’s (authentic, tired) and gave it a name that, unfortunately, is shared by another Carbone (authentic, tired) near Port Authority.</p><p data-wc="202" word_count="202">A place can seem over-move-y, especially when it is new and when it already has what you might call touches: in this case, waiters’ uniforms designed by Zac Posen, art work curated by Vito (son of Julian) Schnabel, a tiled floor derived from Louis’s, in “The Godfather,” and acre-wide menus reminiscent of Hoppe’s Old Heidelberg in “Fast Times at Ridgemont High.” Here come the Parmesan chunks and prosciutto and focaccia bread, as speakers play the Duprees doing “You Belong to Me.” A strong opening. The waiter bends low, in his burgundy tuxedo. “Let’s talk about the process,” he says. He refers to the fruits of the kitchen as though they are his. (“All my veal tonight.”) The delays he does not own: “We are working on the drinks.” He is working on the salad; he makes the Caesar himself, tableside. It’s excellent, with unstinting anchoviness and the town’s presumably most thought through croutons—great caravans of oil. The linguini vongole you can have <em>a piacere</em>, pink or white, although “Chef Mario prefers it pink.” Somehow the waiter conspires to have the Drifters kick into “This Magic Moment” upon delivery of his veal chop, which is now yours.</p><p data-wc="185" word_count="185">How is everything, he asks. Great, by which you mean overwhelming. The portions and the prices are as formidable as the pretense and the patter. The garlic bread is good, and you eat too much of it (and a side of crispy rabe, sheathed in fried dough and tasting of funnel cake, counts more as a bread than a green), so that the veal chop, served with a marsala sauce, is not so much “abracadabra” as it is “my Lord.” Even the bass Alison, for the flesh-averse, manages to make a kaffir-lime zest seem hefty. A group in the back room (a den of wood panelling and brick), arrayed around a star canoodling with a lady who is not his famous wife, fires up a joint, perhaps to re-ignite the appetite. The playlist leaves the oldies behind. A waiter wheels to their table a tray of tiramisu ringed in a fence of ladyfingers. It looks like a Twinkie fort. At night’s end you trundle out onto Thompson to find a Maybach parked in front. Not yours. (Open every night for dinner. Entrées $27-$52.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Wells Dinette	22-25 Jackson Ave., Queens 	40.7419799	-73.953733	718-786-1800	2013/05/20	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="159" word_count="159">It should come as no surprise that the food at M. Wells Dinette, the restaurant at MOMA P.S.1, in Long Island City, far exceeds expectations for museum fare; like the Modern, MOMA’s Michelin-starred restaurant in Manhattan, M. Wells treats cuisine as high art. In keeping with the aesthetic of the building, which was a functioning school until 1963, the sunny, high-ceilinged dining room is designed to look like a classroom. The concept falls just short of gimmicky: school-desk-style tables are sleek and stylish, their drawers filled with notebooks and colored pencils, and both the wine list and the menu are written neatly on huge chalkboards, which are found in many restaurants these days anyhow. From the wall above the open kitchen, René Lévesque, the former would-be Prime Minister of Quebec, gazes down sternly, reminding diners that this school’s principal is the Québécois chef Hugue Dufour, who runs the place with his wife, Sarah Obraitis.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">On a recent visit, a server described almost every dish as “outrageous,” which sounded like a Valley Girl affectation but turned out to be concise. A gravlax tart—flaky dough enveloping sour cream, potatoes, and dill, blanketed in thick slices of maple-cured salmon and snips of chive—was outrageously delicious, as were, surprisingly, oysters Bolognese, each half shell of rich, warm meat sauce punctuated by a cold, briny bivalve. Shrimp spaetzle tossed with spicy sausage, broccolini, and bonito flakes that were moving as though alive—they “dance,” apparently, when you use them to season hot food—was outrageously weird (and delicious). A hunk of pork belly swimming in thick split-pea soup and garnished with a pancake that had been fried in duck fat and drenched in maple syrup was outrageously rich.</p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">When dishes misfire, it tends to be because they contain a few too many ingredients. Perfectly steamed clams in a white-wine broth with ramps embodied the essence of spring, but were weighed down by a sprinkling of hearty farro. A tuft of whipped cream slid, of its own volition, off a massive slab of pineapple upside-down cake, as if it knew the dessert, its edges brûléed to a satisfying toffeelike texture, needed no frills. A miniature “fun pie” became fun only after a group of diners broke through the Count Chocula-like topping to discover a creamy filling. What was that flavor? “Guess!” said the server. Four eager students raised their hands. “Peanut butter?” “Close! Try again.” “Mascarpone?” “Marzipan?” “Custard?” She shook her head, eyes twinkling. It was hazelnut.

The candles are perched in little mounted wooden boxes along with quirky ephemera—an old copy of “Don Quixote,” a Kodak camera, a tiny vase of flowers. This is the specialty of the house: small surprises, little mysteries.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">What, for example, could possibly be making the pyramid of dark octopus tendrils taste so deep, so funky, so smoky and beguiling? Well, they are poached in mirin, rubbed with sriracha and togarashi (the satisfying blend of red chili pepper, orange peel, sesame seeds, ginger, and seaweed that comes in little shakers at Japanese noodle houses), then fried. Humble green beans are likewise transformed into a sensuous shocker when tossed with an uni chili cream—a sharp, rich, stunning combination. Those two dishes alone mark the chef, Richard Kuo, who cooked previously at the pop-up Frej, as a master of umami. Then there are more delicate curiosities, like sliced torched raw scallops served with fresh fennel and charred lily bulb—the taste is like a sky full of pollen hovering over newly sprouting flowers with a hint of ash from the barbecue.</p><p data-wc="67" word_count="67">Not every dish is such a brain bender. There are some earthy, straightforward meatballs, which make a nice starter, and an excellent classic skirt steak that is not overshadowed by its more exotic neighbors on the menu. A light, lovely skate is rendered only slightly unusual by a bit of Moroccan spice on top and a tasty pile of braised leeks and cauliflower purée underneath it.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">But what really keeps the preciousness down is the ambience. The music is rocking but mellow: the Stones, the Byrds, Bowie. The service is excellent but highly laid back, equal parts warm, attentive, and sassy. This mix of the unexpected and the comfy, the festive and the whimsical, makes Pearl &amp; Ash a good place to take a first date—it’s relaxed enough to help with awkwardness but perky enough to keep things moving along. Then again, familiarity spiked with frisson is also the stuff of long-term love. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $23-$28.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/06/prospect-3	Prospect	773 Fulton St., Brooklyn 	40.6861795	-73.9737672	718-596-6826	2013/05/06	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="68" word_count="68">The steady gentrification of Fort Greene has reached its apex: there is, finally, a very good restaurant a short walk from BAM and the Barclays Center. A few blocks away, there is also a “Sandwich Society,” with fifteen-dollar seasonal sandwiches. The existence of the latter may seem to some an abomination, but, if it means we get to keep the former, let’s call it a necessary evil.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">Prospect, on a well-trafficked stretch of Fulton Street, was opened last fall by two New York natives, Alan Cooper and Stephen Cohen, who has worked as a beverage director at Hearth and helped open the wine bar Terroir. Their co-owner and executive chef, Kyle McClelland, formerly of Caviar Russe, brought along his chef de cuisine, Vinson Petrillo. The low-lit dining room is inviting: serene blue walls, gray leather banquettes, dark wood floors. If you sit at the marble chef’s counter overlooking the brightly lit white-tile kitchen, you’ll feel like a judge on a cooking show.</p><p data-wc="196" word_count="196">The cuisine is described as “Modern New American,” which basically means whatever McClelland and Petrillo want it to—there’s a tasting menu that is driven half by the day’s official menu and half by whim. (Recently, it included a course of yakitori-grilled Boston mackerel, complete with head and tail, and forty-day dry-aged bluefin tuna, to be plucked from the plate with takeout chopsticks.) Some starters are familiar—lettuces, pickled beets, charred octopus—while others are more high-concept: spring-pea-and-garlic-milk soup topped with froth, or shelled snow crab stacked with uni, avocado, and assorted microgreens (occasionally from Brooklyn rooftop farms). A Hudson Valley foie-gras terrine was perfectly cool and buttery, but, paired with spring strawberries, rhubarb, and pine nuts, it came disconcertingly close to a dessert. A consistent hit is the spinach-and-ricotta gnudi, with candied Sicilian pistachios, micro sage, and a brown-butter sauce so tarted up with lemon it was impossible not to lick the bowl. And, for the best rack of Colorado lamb this side of the Rockies, look no further than the lamb two ways, grilled and roasted, resting on a swipe of smoked yogurt, with alfalfa sprouts, muscat grapes, morels, and amaranth grains.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">The design touches are quirky and charming: a wall made of reclaimed wood from the old Coney Island boardwalk, a chalkboard in the bathroom, and a series of found black-and-white snapshots of trios of early-twentieth-century women (they’re from the private collection of the sommelier’s father, who nicknamed them the Three Graces). Prospect has all the ambition of some of the city’s best restaurants; the only thing lacking is pretense. (Open Mondays through Fridays for dinner, Saturdays for lunch and dinner, and Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $21-$31.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/29/le-philosophe	Le Philosophe	55 Bond St. 	-33.731401	150.7861116	212-388-0038	2013/04/29	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="142" word_count="142">French restaurants in New York tend to put on French airs—whether on the model of the late, lamented Lutèce (hushed decorum, intimidating staff) or that of Balthazar and its countless imitators (red awnings, tiled interior, stencilled ads for “bières à la pression”). But looking around Le Philosophe, a fancy but casual new restaurant in NoHo, you’d have no idea what food it serves—a contemporary take on Appalachian barbecue, maybe, or upscale ramen? There are gray walls, exposed air ducts, industrial-style overhead lamps, tightly packed tables, and dishes written on a chalkboard above a cramped open kitchen. Not a tablecloth in sight. The only concession to Francophilia is the restaurant’s namesake: a wall of photographs of French philosophers, from Montaigne to Derrida. Anyone who names them all gets a free meal, but so far no one has succeeded.</p><p data-wc="229" word_count="229">And yet the food, for the most part, is not merely French but old-school French. There is Tournedos Rossini, a teetering tower of steak, foie gras, and truffles first ordered by Rossini himself. There is lobster thermidor, a dish from 1894, here cooked with tarragon, Meyer lemon, and a covering of Parmesan cheese, for an over-all effect that evokes butterscotch and lemon yogurt. Suffice it to say that a cup of coffee is about the only thing not prepared with a stick of butter. Modest portions keep prices surprisingly low and calorie loads just barely this side of insanity. The contrast between tradition and informality seems of a piece with the chef, Matthew Aita, a Philadelphian in his early thirties who has been a sous chef under both Daniel Boulud and Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He is continually running around his kitchen, instructing underlings and performing odd jobs—say, scraping scraps of foie gras into a vast heap to be made into pâté. Preparation is extremely impressive for a kitchen of this size: witness the tender meat of the duck à l’orange, which seems to have been cooked to the nanosecond. Though meats are to the fore, Aita is good with vegetables. Veal blanquette is a dialogue between the velvety, almost fonduelike white-wine sauce and the fibrous textures of the underdone root vegetables—turnip squares, a beet the palest pink imaginable.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">The restaurant is across the street from a lavishly sinister condo building designed by Herzog and de Meuron, and it seems perfect for what this neighborhood has become. The clientele is young and affluent, plus a smattering of fashion-forward retirees who perhaps bought lofts in the eighties. Dinner is invariably packed, and there are plans to expand the offerings; one chalkboard lists various French classics—pot-au-feu, bouillabaisse, cassoulet—that aren’t yet on the menu. “We’re working toward it,” a waiter said. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $18-$37.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Little Wisco, includes the neighborhood haunts Joseph Leonard and Jeffrey’s Grocery, the trendy cocktail den Fedora, and the excellent, more rarified Perla. To this commonwealth, Stulman has recently added Chez Sardine, a contemporary take on a Japanese <em>izakaya</em>, in a tiny space with large wood-slatted windows and very few tables and bar seats. The servers have a scrubbed Midwestern look (it has been said that if you’re from the Badger State, you’ll have an edge on getting a job at a Little Wisco joint), and seem to belong to a fraternal social organization that prizes not beer bongs and football games but chicharrones and unagi. </p><p data-wc="194" word_count="194">The crowd, mostly young and game for this sort of thing, thrive on the carefully rendered list of cocktails with oh-so-clever names (the Cousin Scotty Fails His Driving Test has bourbon, vermouth, sake-agave syrup, and bitters). The chef, Mehdi Brunet-Benkritly, of Fedora, is a trend hound who takes of-the-moment ingredients and gives them a twist. The menu of snacks, sushi bites, and small and large plates is full of oddities, ambitious, overwhelmingly rich, and delicious in turn. “Breakfast pancakes”—a stack of silver-dollar-size pancakes layered with chopped fluke, copious salmon roe, and a spicy yogurt sauce—is strange for dinner, or anytime. Charred octopus with lardons, kale, and tomato drowns in the garlic cream that makes the B.L.T. joke cloying. The gimmicky, ultra-rich foie-gras grilled cheese loses its appeal after a few minutes in the open air turns the smoked cheddar from gooey to gluey. But a plate of tiny cod fritters recalls not the state fair but sweet, wonderfully chewy beignets. In a standout special, cauliflower was magically transformed into a flawless disk of panna cotta, served with dashi broth and sprinkled with scallions, bonito flakes, and crunchy toasted bread crumbs.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">The successful more traditionally Japanese offerings tend to be clean and bright. Black Bass Sashimi, compositionally austere and beautiful, arrived atop a slash of black-garlic purée, mixed with orange and hidden under paper-thin slices of Tokyo turnip. Some sushi bites, like the briney marvel of chopped beef with uni, and the delicately smoked arctic char over a mix of chewy and crunchy rice, are spectacular. One night, when a tentative diner wondered how to best approach the rather foreboding miso-and-maple-glazed salmon head, the waitress instructed, “Just get in there and see what happens. Here are some towels if you want to get extra involved.” In other words, show some spirit. (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/15/mighty-quinns-and-john-brown-smokehouse	Mighty Quinn’s And John Brown Smokehouse	103 Second Ave., at 6th St. 	null	null	null	2013/04/15	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="115" word_count="115">New Yorkers are familiar with the blood sport of whoever-gets-there-first. At Mighty Quinn’s—a new restaurant that, somewhat suspiciously, bills its food as Texalina barbecue (the sauce is Texas spicy with a Carolina vinegar kick)—when it comes to finding a seat, it’s every meat lover for himself. It goes like this: enter the clean, white-tiled space and join the waiting throngs; send someone to the cafeteria-style line to order while eying the few four-tops, the long communal table, and the stools at the window; if you see anyone who might be about to rise from her chair, barrel through the crowd, pushing aside small children and the elderly, and be the winner.</p><p data-wc="167" word_count="167">The pit master Hugh Mangum has the best intentions, of course. The wood for those tables was salvaged from the Puck Building. The cardboard troughs that hold the food are made from recycled materials (the compostable cups and utensils are, too). And Mighty Quinn’s Cinderella story is so New York Right Now: Mangum’s stand was one of the most popular at the Williamsburg Smorgasburg, breeding grounds for the hippest of foodie obsessions. People stood in that gravel for hours for a reason: empires have been forged with lesser goods than this brisket. Smoked with oak, apple, and cherry wood, the meat is pink, juicy, and practically melting, with perfectly charred, salty-sweet burnt edges. As for the other stuff, the pulled pork is fine; the pork ribs are too salty; the baked beans and pecan-studded sweet potatoes are overloaded with sugar. But the delicious beef rib, a gargantuan thing that offers a vast array of beefy textural experiences, can, and should, be shared with six people.</p><p data-wc="189" word_count="189">Across the East River, on a desolate stretch of Long Island City, the folks at John Brown Smokehouse are practicing another sport altogether: relaxation. Last summer, Josh Bowen moved his Kansas City-style barbecue spot, named for the firebrand abolitionist, into this larger, homey place, with a beer garden out back. One recent Tuesday night at 7:30, the “86” list—of things not ready yet—included ribs, rib tips, wings, and pork belly. The brisket was a gray, dry disappointment. But there were worthwhile delicacies: silky, gamey pulled pork, with superb barbecue sauce to be added at the table (Kansas City ’cue is slow smoked and heavily sauced); piquant homemade pastrami; a juicy and amazing lamb sausage. Meaty collards and fresh-cut fries were plain and true. As the canned harmonica blues receded and a live Cajun band struck up, one felt at leisure to study the framed lock of John Brown’s hair, and notice the smiles all around and the amiably open seats. (Mighty Quinn’s is open daily for lunch and dinner. Meats $12-$23 per pound. John Brown Smokehouse is open daily for lunch and dinner. Meats $17-$22 per pound.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/08/the-pines	The Pines	284 Third Ave., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2013/04/08	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="101" word_count="101">If anyone knows how to get people to eat fancy food in unlikely places, it’s the crew behind the Pines. Seed money came from the owners of Littleneck, a clam shack a couple of storefronts down; on a good Friday night, when the room there is full and the rosé is flowing, it feels like a slice of Belle Époque life by the Gowanus. The chef at the Pines is Angelo Romano, who used to cook at Roberta’s, the pizzeria that opened on a desolate Bushwick block in 2008 and is now a favorite of the Clintons and Kirsten Dunst.</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">For those who have contended that what Gowanus needed was more ‘nduja, they will be pleased to find it here, along with oxtail, black truffles, and satsuma. In a sign of the menu’s almost absurd ambition, these last three ingredients are actually all in the same dish of cappellacci. (There are a couple of pasta dishes on offer, but even though this is South Brooklyn, there’s no red sauce in sight.) The ‘nduja—if you didn’t know that there exists a spicy pork sausage that is <em>spreadable</em>, eat some immediately—comes blended with amaranth, an ancient grain used by the Aztecs in religious ceremonies, which is now sold in bulk bins at Whole Foods. There’s even bone marrow topped with sea urchin, a combination that has possibly reached the point of cliché.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">The food has a kitchen-sink quality, and, as is the trend, the menu seeks to telegraph seriousness by naming dishes for a single ingredient (“greens,” “octopus”)—but what does it all taste like? At times, there was a sense of overreach: the pasta could be too al dente, like chewing electrical wire. That amaranth-and-‘nduja dish, which sounded so intriguing, was a chore, like eating meaty porridge. And the bread—albeit from Grandaisy, and served with caraway butter—cost six dollars. (This is too much to pay for bread when the restaurant remains obstinately cash-only.)</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">In an uneven meal, there were some delightful surprises. “Lettuce,” which could have been the most boring dish on the menu, turned out to be among the best. The visual pun was that the croutons scattered around the wedge of romaine were actually slowly rendered nuggets of guanciale. It came with a dollop of dressing on the side, egg yolk, honey, and agar whipped into a white orb, light and smooth, like a meringue. And there was a memorable cocktail called the Baked Apple, made with bourbon, apple cider, and “smoke,” with which the glass was filled before the drink was poured. The smoke came from an applewood log that had been infused with cinnamon, allspice, and blood-orange zest. Drinking it was like being in a college dorm room, near clove cigarettes, but more pleasant.

Now it also boasts an American outpost of a successful Danish sandwich restaurant in a space that resembles a museum café. Adam Aamann, a former colleague of the Nordic food prophet Claus Meyer, is widely credited with reinventing the traditional open-faced sandwiches known as smørrebrød. Slices of buttered rye bread topped with rich meats and fish were a fashionable lunch tradition in Copenhagen in the late nineteenth century, and now they’re being served on slab plates amid sleek Danish furniture in Tribeca. It’s Le Pain Quotidien with a Scandinavian makeover.</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">Every sandwich enthusiast has her ideal ratio of bread to protein to garnish, and smørrebrød, being open-faced, lean generously toward the filling. Still, bread can make or break a sandwich. At Aamanns, the heavily malted rye is complexly sweet, savory, and nutty, unlike any you’ll get on a pastrami sandwich in New York. Rectangles of it come artfully supplemented with beef tartare studded with potato chips and sliced cornichons, or creamy chicken salad with mushroom, celeriac, and garlic. Most are served cold, and some have what resemble traditional fixings, like roasted beef sirloin with crispy onions and freshly grated horseradish. Kale “tartare,” with endives, apples, and walnuts, could just as easily have been labelled “salad” to avoid a modicum of ridicule. One evening, toppings included breaded, pan-fried hake with herbs, and pork pâté with parsley, aquavit, hazelnuts, pickled apples, celery, and watercress—a unanimous favorite, despite what sounds like three ingredients too many.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">The best way to enjoy the range of options is “A Full Taste of Copenhagen” ($46 per person). It includes several rounds of smørrebrød with an intermission for meaty herring, which might come pickled with juniper berries, in a spicy tomato compote, or in a mustard tarragon cream. It remains to be seen what kind of foot traffic dill aquavit will attract. (Open Mondays through Fridays for breakfast, Tuesdays through Sundays for lunch, and Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner.

You must accept the fact that if your dinner companion is running a few minutes late, the topknotted, crisp-blazered, spike-heeled hostess may ask that you “please keep in mind your reservation is for five-forty-five” (as if you could forget). You must cheerfully agree to take a picture of the group of middle-aged bankers sitting next to you on a dads’ night out and chuckle appreciatively while they, discussing sashimi, exchange one-liners (“Cool Hand Fluke?” “You gotta be flukin’ kiddin’ me!”). You must delight in the moment when your waiter, who is wearing a custom tiepin and has been speaking with a formal, studied air, breaks character by leaning in to tell you that the rock-shrimp sushi is “bangin’.”</p><p data-wc="196" word_count="196">What are sashimi and sushi doing on the menu at a steak house? The question won’t be answered by ordering the latter—the shrimp, perched atop slices of an avocado-jalapeño roll, are tasty enough, but indistinguishable from what you’d get at any neighborhood joint. Cubes of rice fried golden brown and daubed with chopped kobe beef, truffle aioli, and snips of scallion fare a bit better, but it’s probably best to skip anything vaguely Japanese-sounding. Try, instead, ordering dishes that begin with “P”; they seem, for some reason, to be the superior things on offer. Two arrive at the beginning of the meal, free of charge: crisp, briny half-sour pickles and piping-hot, peppery three-cheese popovers, which look like inflated muffins and taste like Heaven, especially slathered in butter. These could comprise a satisfying meal on their own, washed down with an excellent New Dirty martini (vodka, Lillet, sea salt, orange bitters), but then you’d miss out on the many varieties of potato: the baked is monstrous and burrito-like, crammed with stringy Fontina, bacon, and sour cream, while potatoes Arlington are thinly sliced silver dollars with crunchy perimeters and creamy white centers.</p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">There is, of course, plenty of steak at this steak house, whose lavish décor evokes a Paris train station, but with Peter Luger just across the river, why bother? A juicy twelve-ounce skirt is made less palatable by its thirty-six-dollar price tag, and though the bone-in rib-eye’s charred crust has a complex, interesting flavor, similar to that of an aged-cheese rind, the meat itself is just average. Fortunately there are several desserts that begin with “P”: a peanut-butter-chocolate bar, for example, served with a scoop of popcorn ice cream, or pie (a buoyant banana crème), drizzled in Nutella.

Harold Dieterle could have helped out. The chef’s third West Village restaurant was inspired by the cuisine of his mother’s Italian heritage and that of his German-born father. Had the politicians broken bread with the Marrow’s salt-studded pretzel rolls, served with both whole-grain mustard and olive oil, or shared plates of duck liverwurst and addictive prosciutto-wrapped dates, one imagines a détente would have been achieved on the spot.</p><p data-wc="247" word_count="247">You could say, without insult, that Dieterle’s food is all over the map. After winning the first season of “Top Chef,” in 2006, the talented Long Island native, with his business partner, Alicia Nosenzo, opened Perilla, named for a species of mint, better known as <em>shiso</em>, favored by cooks from Laos to Japan. Their second spot, Kin Shop, plays winningly fast and loose with the cuisine of Thailand, and a similar creative spirit rules at the Marrow. Take its namesake dish: one long marrow-filled bone, topped with briny dollops of sea urchin and Meyer-lemon aioli, a one-two-three punch of umami, balanced by baby celery greens and crispy cubelets of potato. Just as harmonious are the pillow-soft gnudi, spruced up with salty baccalà and prickly-hot cherry peppers, then mellowed, Sicilian-style, by pine nuts and yellow raisins. Who knew the Germans did crudo? Let the starter of cured arctic char, served with beets, pistachios, and a kicky horseradish cream open your mind. The main courses are less predictable in their success rate. The pan-fried duck schnitzel is grease-free perfection, crunchy on the outside and fragrantly moist when the knife meets the cutlet. But, on one recent evening, the culotte steak of wagyu, a famously butter-soft beef, arrived chewy. One man’s meat is another man’s fungus, and vegetarians don’t get short shrift. There’s a roasted hen-of-the-woods mushroom so massive that when it arrived, atop cardoon-creamed kale, one friend teased another, “What did you order, a log?”</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">Even those who polish off their whole mushroom must save room for dessert from the pastry whiz Ginger Fisher. A golden <em>apfletasche</em>, billed on the menu as an “apple hand pie,” comes with caramel for dipping and ice cream made from quark cheese. A creamy chocolate <em>budino</em> is topped with crackly hazelnut brittle. But if you order only one sweet, take a cue from Shakespeare’s “Love’s Labour’s Lost”: “An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy gingerbread”—or, in this case, the delectable ginger stout cake.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/11/aska	Aska	90 Wythe Ave., Brooklyn 	40.7217038	-73.9582537	718-388-2969	2013/03/11	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="130" word_count="130">It is uncertain when the Nordic lands first became a source of trendiness. Early chroniclers mention one Erik Koolssen, who raided the Irish coast in the ninth century, subjecting the monastic settlements there to a regime of minimalist furniture and comprehensive health care. More recently, in the gustatory realm, the big news has been the Danish restaurant Noma and the foraging philosophy that underpins it. This movement now makes U.S. landfall in Williamsburg (which has been trendy even longer than Scandinavia), in the shape of Aska, a small restaurant and bar in a space that also encompasses an art-and-design studio. Five nights a week, a fantastical tasting menu emerges from the brain of Fredrik Berselius, a young Swede who previously ran the pop-up restaurant Frej in the same place.</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">The aesthetic is sparse and windswept-looking; a few plain twigs straggle from the light fittings, and food is served on rough earthenware, specially made by a potter upstate. There’s a bar menu that gives a good sense of the style for anyone who doesn’t want the six courses of the tasting menu. Standouts are a gentle potato soup, garnished with black-radish slices and crispy kale, and pork-filled potato dumplings in a frothy smoked-cheese mousse. On the tasting menu, which varies from night to night, innovative, delightful, and just plain weird touches abound. The one that has garnered the most attention is an amuse-bouche consisting of pig’s blood dried into a chip and topped with sea-buckthorn purée. Actually, the taste of the blood lacks focus and character, so the gimmick satisfies neither gastronomic nor vampiric urges. Far better is a dried-scallop chip: anyone who has ever scraped the pan after cooking scallops will recognize the flavor. But the most winning details are more unassuming. A pat of local butter is smeared casually on the side of a bread plate. Minuscule baby potatoes accompanying a herring are daringly undercooked.</p><p data-wc="166" word_count="166">It becomes apparent that Berselius enjoys juxtaposing subtle flavors with rich ones and also that he has a thing for hiding your food: pig’s trotter shelters under translucent shavings of sunchoke; monkfish and its liver are buried beneath cabbage leaves of various colors. If there’s a fault, it’s that his ability to extract huge flavors from unlikely ingredients overpowers not only subtler tones but, eventually, the diner. Three hours of cooking make a beet impressively luxuriant and sugary, but the dish is hard to finish. These are small points in the face of a meal that manages to be both refined and genial, earnest but not precious. It is typical of Aska’s love of details that, when serving a whey-and-lingonberry sorbet for dessert, Berselius explained that the whey was the residue from the making of the smoked cheese that had been served at the start of the meal. (Bar open nightly; tasting menu available Sundays through Thursdays. Bar food $3-$12; tasting menu $65.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

But for the occasional escapist dinner experience there is no beating Gaonnuri, a vast lounge-style restaurant floating high over Thirty-second Street that serves quite tasty Korean fare and offers impressive views of Manhattan—though it doesn’t actually feel like it’s in Manhattan. Gaonnuri means “center of the world” in Korean, and indeed it seems to be located in a kind of alternate universe: not quite Tokyo, not quite Chicago, and certainly not quite Koreatown. The décor is modern and slick; the entryway has the ambience of a nice-enough boutique-hotel lobby. Inside the dining area itself, the skyline views are too distracting for the interior to matter much. The service is crisp and no-nonsense and features the prominent use of iPads. The food is, for the most part, traditional—as in traditional Americanized Korean cuisine—but, in its way, it is as transportive as the surroundings.</p><p data-wc="175" word_count="175">Table grills always provide a certain amount of excitement, and, in keeping with the spirit of adventure, you may be tempted to order sliced duck breast or pork belly instead of the usual short rib for your barbecue. But the most predictable meats are still the best: rib eye and brisket, served with pickled radishes and carrots and bracing kimchi, do not disappoint. It’s fun, though, to watch your waiter snip squash and giant mushrooms with scissors directly onto the flame, even if they do get a bit dried out in the cooking. Beautiful bowls of bibimbap arrive topped not with the traditional egg but with “micro greens” and “mountain vegetables.” The effect is refreshing and spa-like. The sublimely slithery <em>japchae</em> was rich and chewy, yet clean-feeling. (Not so the delicious selection of delicately flavored but deeply fried pancakes.) Dessert is a fussy and baroque affair: the selections, like pineapple cremeux and deconstructed <em>soo jeong kwa</em> (poached Korean pear with cinnamon chantilly, <em>yakgwa</em>, and ginger ice cream), have a certain Cirque du Soleil quality.</p><p data-wc="71" word_count="71">Alcohol flows freely at Gaonnuri—there’s a full bar, and the cocktails aren’t bad, but soju is really the way to go.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/02/25/jones-wood-foundry	Jones Wood Foundry	401 E. 76th St. 	40.633036	-73.9155989	212-249-2700	2013/02/25	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="145" word_count="145">Before Coney Island and the Catskills, there was Jones Wood, a forested section of Manhattan running down to the East River between what are now Sixty-sixth and Seventy-fifth Streets. This rustic plot was a popular getaway for the island’s suffocated citizens, and the leading candidate to be its great new public park, before Central Park won out. Eventually the woods burned up, making way for the present-day veldt of hospitals, coffee shops, and frat-boy bars like the Stumble Inn. So Jones Wood Foundry, a two-year-old pub in a slender brick building that once housed an ironworks, is a welcome addition to a bar-scene wilderness. Elsewhere in town, the cool kids have been gorging for years on meat pies, kedgeree, and Fuller’s ale, but not so much on the Upper East Side. The new pub gospel was slow to reach the Bud Light hinterlands.</p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">“Pie and mash is pie and mash,” Jason Hicks, the chef and co-owner, has said. His pub grub isn’t putting on any airs, nor is it ironic. One of the best things on offer is that old pub standard bangers and mash, here a trio of sausages from Myers of Keswick, in the West Village, each one on its own pillow of mashed potatoes, with caramelized-onion gravy and a bit of veal stock. The lamb pie, chunks of sauced meat beneath a dome of pick-at-the-rim pastry, is old school, as straight up as a right to the jaw after an argument over a round of darts, yet the ploughman’s pork pie, which sounds tough, is something of a sophisticate: a terrine of spiced meat in a delicate pastry, served in slices on a cutting board with celery-root rémoulade, greens, pickled onion, and a boiled egg. It’s a hint that Hicks, who’s from the Cotswolds, has a bistro background; he was formerly a chef at Orsay and La Goulue.</p><p data-wc="159" word_count="159">A lot of this seemed, even to some ungrizzled tongues, a little undersalted—a phenomenon perhaps common to the U.K. and the Upper East Side. So sometimes the accompaniments—a tomato chutney, for the beef rissoles, or the Sir Kensington’s ketchup—came on like aging character actors in supporting roles, upstaging the leads. The so-called “toasts,” or small plates, did, as well, chief among them the Scotch egg, a delicious death bomb, and the scoop of foie gras encased in chicken liver, shaped like a bullata shell, which you smear on toast points. It’s the toasts, and the assortment of ales, that might counteract your suspicions, as you pass a cold, dark winter’s night stuffing yourself with meat and beer, that this regimen might be a hard sell in summer, the traditional season, centuries ago, for frolicking in Jones Wood.

She’s also a savvy interpreter of her native country’s slogan—the Land of Smiles. The walls of her year-old restaurant are dotted with proclamations of bonhomie—there’s a chalkboard announcing, “We serve with heart and proudly support local farms,” a blaring light-bulb-studded “LOVE” sign, and a giant stencilled Julia Child quote likening cooking to, well, love. So much love in the air is hard to resist, and, for the most part, it’s made its way into the food.</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">A kind waiter, generous and honest in good measure, answered the question “What’s your favorite thing on the menu?” with “Everything on the menu is good.” What about the curry rice with wings? “Don’t really like that one.” But the chicken wings, finished with tamarind chili sauce, are as addictive as any topnotch Buffalo variety. So are the spiced Chiang Mai fries, fashioned from kabocha pumpkin and sweet potato, for dipping in curry mayo. Oyster shooters in champagne are not as successful, unless you like something that resembles a tiny brain in your bubbly. Salads, like the <em>yum sum o</em> pomelo, are as tasty as they are fascinating—fennel is mixed with grapefruit-like pomelo sections, toasted coconut, kaffir lime, and candied citrus rind. </p><p data-wc="165" word_count="165">The servers go for the heavy sell on the lobster, available in soup, on pad thai, and in the lobster-dumpling <em>kao soy</em>. The lobster is fine, but it’s not as succulent as the Cutie Duckling <em>ghang ped bhed yang</em>, Long Island duck expertly crisped and accented with lychees, or the braised <em>hung lay</em> short rib, served with poached egg. The list goes on: lamb roti, the Dark Knight (skinny black squid-ink noodles, stir-fried to a perfect char), crispy whole branzino. The desserts—like the raw-tasting Ovaltine brownie and a poached pear over a hockey puck of sticky rice—don’t fare so well. You could opt for pad thai for dessert, the refreshing one made with papaya noodles, or another Tom Yum Tini cocktail. Either way, the staff will express their gratitude, and you might just take to heart what it states on the menu: “WE <u>LOVE</u> SERVING YOU!” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

Everything has a story: the tables are handcrafted from—what else?—vintage bowling-alley lanes, and the wooden folding chairs come from a Kentucky church. Where better to sit while food-worshipping? Ask for an explanation of the unfamiliar ingredients in a craft cocktail called the Lord Byron, and you’ll receive a friendly but overwrought monologue, followed by a drink that tastes pretty much like a Negroni. The beets are organic heirloom, the pork is Berkshire, the fluke is local. (How local—the East River? The Gowanus?)</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">Eye-rolling aside, it’s hard not to appreciate the elegant Art Deco light fixtures, and the food, creative yet controlled, is unusually delicious. Seafood fares particularly well—that local fluke, served as ceviche with grapefruit, mint, pickled chiles, and a side of popcorn, is delicate and refreshing, and tastes not remotely polluted. The Eden Brook trout may have travelled all the way from the Hudson Valley, but it’s no worse for the wear, its roasted skin and silky pink flesh complemented beautifully by smashed fingerling potatoes and béarnaise. Grilled octopus and glazed pork belly, served over arugula and white beans, seems like the logical evolution of surf-and-turf; for pure turf, try the excellent burger, topped with crinkle-cut bread-and-butter pickles, or the crispy, oozing Cuban. Vegetarians need not despair: in addition to a selection of small plates under the heading “veg,” there are meat-free entrées, like a surprisingly tasty cauliflower custard, accompanied by caramelized onion farro.</p><p data-wc="96" word_count="96">Mayfield is named for Curtis, which could account for why the food has been described as “soul-food influenced.” In fact, the only dish that qualifies is the buttermilk-fried quail, and it might be the menu’s single misstep: the batter is perfect, as are its sides of spoonbread (cornmeal pudding) and hearty, bacon-flecked collard greens, but the bird itself is just too dainty. Luckily, the spoonbread can be ordered on its own, and it’s sweet enough for dessert. (Open Mondays, and Wednesdays through Saturdays, for dinner and Sundays for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/28/lapicio	L’Apicio	13 E. 1st St. 	34.0721176	-118.358341	212-533-7400	2013/01/28	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="139" word_count="139">Gabe Thompson and Joe Campanale—the duo behind Dell’Anima, L’Artusi, and Anfora—have, for their latest Italian restaurant, expanded beyond the cramped charm of the West Village to a soaring space on the ground floor of an East Village condominium building. The décor is almost anonymously modern, with geodesic-globe lighting and window walls; the effect is more West Elm showroom than epicurean destination. It’s all the more surprising, then, to find such charismatic food emerging from L’Apicio’s kitchen. Diners should not be deterred by the restaurant’s hotel-lobby-ish lounge, where they likely won’t have to wait long for a table (the enormous space seats a hundred and sixty), but they might consider arriving early to sit and enjoy an herbaceous grapefruit Aperol spritz or a clever “white negroni,” made with Cocchi Americano.</p><p data-wc="259" word_count="259">Diners looking to bowl a strike should aim straight down the middle column of the menu, which lists pastas and polentas. Salads can miss, but when they hit they redeem the entire category. One recent evening, escarole came a little droopy, weighed down by tangy Pecorino-buttermilk dressing and not nearly enough cucumber to provide a lift. But an unusual watercress salad was tamed by cumin yogurt and sweet, meaty roasted carrots, and Bosc pear with radicchio and blue cheese was surprisingly delicate, given its bold ingredients. A lemonier cousin of Dell’Anima’s famous sautéed Brussels sprouts appears here with thin slices of speck; one woman couldn’t stop picking at them and declared that they tasted “like potato chips, in a good way.” L’Apicio’s waitstaff are rightly proud of its pastas, though they might consider using a word other than “toothsome” to praise the slightly-chewy-in-a-good-way texture—it’s a false cognate for al dente. Pastas and polentas arrive with a tall mound of shaved cheese, like a drift of fresh powdery snow. It looks sure to overpower the dish, but it never does. Watch out for salt, though; it’s so concentrated in the green garganelli with lamb Bolognese that it may serve as a safety brake for the fast eater. A good antidote to this intensity is the polenta, weightless like edible clouds of cornmeal. It doesn’t matter whether it’s topped with mushrooms, short rib, or pork meatballs—its texture caused one home cook to wonder, “Is it puffed up with air?”</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">One night, the cheese menu was proffered at the start of the meal—an unorthodox but not unwelcome twist. If the house-made ricotta is available, kindly ask your server to run, rather than walk, to retrieve a dollop of it with cranberry compote and crackers. It tastes more of butter than of cheese, echoing, of all things, breakfast toast and jam. Buyer beware: you may need to order it again for dessert.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/21/el-toro-blanco	El Toro Blanco	257 Sixth Ave., at Bleecker St. 	null	null	null	2013/01/21	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="143" word_count="143">There’s an old Mexican proverb: Conversation is food for the soul. In other words, for every gastronome standing in line for beef-tongue tacos at a food truck in Astoria, there’s a weekend warrior who just wants to unwind downtown with friends over warm chips and cold margaritas. Enter El Toro Blanco, the latest venture from John McDonald and Josh Capon, the team behind the crowd-pleasing SoHo establishments Lure Fishbar and Burger &amp; Barrel Winepub. At a moment when the city’s Mexican-food scene, which has long been defined by its absence, is vastly improving—from the bona-fide Chiapas cuisine at Casa Enrique in Hunters Point to the pan-Mexican marvels at Alex Stupak’s Empellón restaurants—the goals of El Toro Blanco seem comparatively modest. But if your dining-out checklist includes a buzzy room, fresh food, and good service, then mission accomplished.</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">The décor is So Cal modern, with exposed beams, glazed black and red tile, orange banquettes, and mid-century pictures of Spanish dancers and toreadors. A big stuffed sailfish at the entrance, near the ten-seat tequila bar, is a clue that the food here ranges beyond the bull’s turf to such surf-friendly options as ceviche, Baja fish tacos, and lobster. (The latter is worth ordering for the side of on-the-cob “street corn” alone.) Begin with a bowl of guacamole. Made to order in an open station near the front of the house, it’s chunky and tangy, and delivers a surprising degree of heat. It arrives with toasty corn chips and a trio of salsas, which can bring out the Goldilocks in a diner. The red salsa fresca is a little too mild, and the yellow habanero-and-pepita diablo is a little too spicy. But the garlicky tomatillo salsa verde, flecked with mint and cilantro, is just right.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Although the menu boasts authentic ingredients like nopales cactus (served grilled with queso fresco in tacos and diced in a salad that accompanies skirt-steak <em>tampiqueña</em>), it feels formulaic. There are the obligatory chicken enchiladas, the tacos al pastor, and the pollo en mole, a moist chicken a la plancha slathered in a <em>coloradito</em> sauce that errs on the sweet side, aptly summed up by the menu as “fruity, nutty, red.” But formulas are what keep people flocking to McDonald and Capon’s establishments—not for nothing is Lure Fishbar about to open a branch in Miami. In today’s global network, word gets around. After dessert at El Toro Blanco on one recent evening, a delighted young woman looked up from her iPhone and informed her table, “I just Instagrammed my churros, and three people already liked it!” (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/14/pig-and-khao	Pig And Khao	68 Clinton St. 	38.6080344514523	-89.6080862357592	212-920-4485	2013/01/14	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="150" word_count="150">“This is not Momofuku,” a diner said recently at Pig and Khao, a new restaurant on the Lower East Side. The distinction may seem obvious, but it bears repeating, since Pig and Khao displays many hallmarks of the empires created by both David Chang and this restaurant’s part owners the Fatty Crew (Fatty ’Cue, Fatty Crab). You’ve got your young chef dishing out irreverent takes on Asian street food: Leah Cohen, a “Top Chef” contestant, created the menu based on her travels to Thailand and the Philippines. Your casually hip setting: patrons sit on simple wooden benches and sip cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon while listening to Skrillex. And you’ve got your conspicuous references to the joys of eating animal fat. David Chang combined these elements to create a new breed of Asian-American comfort food, but at Pig and Khao, the formula doesn’t work as smoothly.</p><p data-wc="253" word_count="253">The menu is divided into small plates, large plates, and “snacks,” which tend to be fried: a cup of fried chickpeas resembles a helping of Kix cereal. The chicharrones are small, round, and greasy, as chicharrones tend to be. And then there’s salmon skin, sourced from nearby Russ &amp; Daughters. An intriguing concept—fish skin, a popular South Asian treat, is not common in the States—but the thick hunks of dried skin resemble scaly potato chips. Quail adobo, a small plate, is a bright spot. Battered, fried, and flavored with garlicky adobo sauce, it tastes like boneless chicken wings. A table unfamiliar with Filipino food was divided about the Sizzling Sisig: a pig’s head is broken down, braised, grilled, chopped, sautéed, and presented on a hot iron platter, with a raw egg. It tastes surprisingly mild—“It reminds me of turkey stuffing,” one eater remarked—but it’s not hard to be put off by the greasy, cube-shaped morsels of head meat. The idea behind the curry-spiced lamb, served next to a pile of whole-wheat chapatis, seems to be to wrap the meat in a chapati, forming a kind of lamb taco—a daunting endeavor, since the meat’s still on the bone. The whole fried fish arrives at your table in a pot of seasoned broth, its body curled into a dramatic C-shape, its face clenched in a grimace. The dish gets points for not pandering to American sensibilities, but that doesn’t mean you want to eat it.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">The best thing on Pig and Khao’s menu might be the <em>halo-halo</em>, a Filipino dessert whose name means “mix-mix.” Cohen has pared it down to a few tasty elements: shaved ice, <em>leche</em> flan, <em>ube</em> ice cream (made from purple yam), <em>macapuno</em> (a kind of coconut), and a toasted Filipino sweet rice called <em>pinipig</em>. It tastes like a bowl of cereal on steroids—the crunchy puffed rice mingling with the milky shaved ice—and it might even be better than a Momofuku creation, the popular “cereal milk” soft-serve ice cream.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/la-vara	La Vara	268 Clinton St., Brooklyn 	40.68846895	-73.9977108514445	718-422-0065	2013/01/07	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="101" word_count="101">Further proof that Brooklyn is set to become the new Manhattan: Alex Raij, who single-handedly popularized tapas in New York at the West Chelsea gallery haunts she founded (Tia Pol, El Quinto Pino, Txikito), has opened a new restaurant in Cobble Hill that is equally sophisticated—and just as pricey. At La Vara, on a quiet residential block, it’s hard to get out for less than seventy dollars per person, but there seems to be no shortage of parents with strollers who are willing to pay more than they are accustomed to for a meal that is hard to fault.</p><p data-wc="258" word_count="258">La Vara serves tapas, in the sense that most of the plates are small and designed to be shared, but it’s a long way from what tapas started as—a slice of cheese or meat used to cover a sherry glass to protect it from fruit flies. In a departure from the straight-up Basque flavors of her previous restaurants, here Raij has drawn influences from the Moorish and Sephardic foods of northern Spain. A hearty Iberian suckling-pig dish, for instance, is tempered with delicate, aromatic flavors of rose water and quince, and an appetizer of quail eggs is drizzled with green tahini, like a refined, pita-free sabich. The list of specials is long, and usually involves the crowd-pleasing concoction known as migas, which has nothing to do with the Tex-Mex egg dish: it’s chorizo and bread crumbs sautéed with grapes, onions, and capers, and is the kind of deceptively simple, perfectly executed cooking you can almost convince yourself would be possible to re-create at home. There’s an abundance of fried foods, which come in a parade like a Spanish version of dim sum, including a little parcel of greens (Swiss chard, black kale) with pine nuts and currants, and artichoke leaves, never greasy, with anchovy aioli. The lamb meatballs with yogurt sauce are juicy enough to require multiple napkins, and you’ll need even more when someone spills the jug of sangria in an eagerness to reach the plates on the other side of the table. Is there a higher compliment to the kitchen?</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">Tapas remains drinking food, and each night there are two white wines available, two types of Cava, and three variations on the gin-and-tonic. One is made with the wonderful Fever Tree tonic and one uses Kas Limon, a Spanish soda with plenty of actual lemon juice. The best “Gintonic,” though, is the one that comes with the peel of an entire lemon wrapped around the top of the glass, to be inhaled, like a bouquet, with every sip. It’s a drink so light and fragrant that it makes summer seem not just possible but imminent. (Open daily for dinner. Small plates $5-$19.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/ootoya	Ootoya	8 W. 18th St. 	29.8015194	-95.4365853	212-255-0018	2012/12/24	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="140" word_count="140">To the Westerner, it can seem as if there are two contrary Japans—one a slow, peaceful land of Shinto shrines and tea ceremonies, the other a jangling zone of automation, neon signs, and bullet trains packed with commuters. Most of New York’s notable Japanese restaurants work hard to evoke the almost intimidating refinement of the former. But now comes Ootoya, a chain restaurant that has a hundred outlets in Tokyo and two hundred more across Asia. Just as the classic New York diner serves everything from chicken Cordon Bleu to gyros and hamburgers, so Ootoya presents seemingly the whole of Japanese cuisine—yakitori, noodles, sushi, hot pots, and, for that matter, hamburgers. Known as <em>hanbaga</em> in Japan—say it out loud—hamburger is often eaten without the bun, and Ootoya’s version comes in a thick demi-glace sauce.</p><p data-wc="169" word_count="169">The décor, with beams set into the walls and a wood-panelled ceiling, evokes a classic <em>izakaya</em>, or sake bar. The place is reliably packed with Japanese expats in search of home comforts. (There are no reservations, and there’s usually a wait.) In the Japanese way, diners are announced when seated, eliciting a resounding “Irasshaimase” (“Welcome”) from the kitchen. Appetizers include classic Japanese bar food such as <em>ika no shiokara</em>, strips of raw squid dressed in sauce of its own fermented viscera. Definitely an acquired taste, its appearance and flavor resemble that of a well-rotted apple. Equally unfamiliar but more immediately palatable is a dish of cold soba noodles with <em>tororo</em>, a kind of mountain yam. Grating turns the yam to a pulp of unbelievable stickiness. (Wikipedia claims that it was used as a sexual lubricant in the Edo period—a fact too good to check.) The soba end up bound so firmly together that pulling a few strands with chopsticks lifts the whole mass off the plate.</p><p data-wc="163" word_count="163">Main dishes can be ordered either on their own or <em>teishoku</em>, on a lacquered tray with various sides (miso soup, rice, pickles, and so on). Ootoya’s grilled and fried dishes are sinfully good. Yakitori skewers of chicken skin and (especially) tail are succulent little delivery devices for fat. (Yakitori okra is worth trying, too.) Several dishes feature fantastically tender pork cutlet under a perfectly golden shell of panko bread crumbs. If the kitchen seems to have the oil end of the taste spectrum down, dishes involving water fare less well. Pickles, usually so crunchy and delicate in Japanese cooking, here seem waterlogged and tired. Sushi and sashimi—hardly the restaurant’s focus, admittedly—are lacklustre. But those who want fish have an exciting option in <em>hanabiwan</em>, which mixes sashimi with more of that mountain yam, plus other mucilaginous ingredients, like fermented soybeans, egg, and okra. The result is a pungent symphony of slime. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Main courses $10-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

As temperatures dropped in late fall, the menu, which changes daily and takes cues from British classics, seemed designed to bulk diners up for winter. The rillettes in a potted-duck appetizer were packed tightly into a small glass jar and sealed with a thick layer of creamy, peppered lard for spreading on toast triangles, while a mammoth pork chop, marbled with luscious fat, tasted of buttered popcorn. A veal potpie, densely packed with cubes of tender chuck, carrots, and peas, was big and rich enough to feed three people—“or one giant,” quipped a wide-eyed young woman. “Do you think they’ll let us sleep here?” she asked after a few too many bites, slumping into her seat.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">These dishes were tasty enough—as was, particularly, a happy-hour sandwich piled high with fried calamari slathered in chunky tartar sauce—and felt appropriate in the restaurant’s shire-inn-style setting: the décor, marked by exposed wooden beams, leather banquettes, and vintage wallpaper depicting British leisure-time activities like cricket and foxhunting, is as heavy as the food. But the focal point of the room is a tall, single-paned modernist window above the bar that perfectly frames the changing leaves of a tree outside, and the dishes that give at least the impression of lightness are truly memorable. A thin slab of gelatinous pork terrine, as beautifully translucent as stained glass, was served with a bright salad of crunchy celery, currants, and parsley; oysters, splashed with cream and prosecco, were flash-baked to an almost glittery sheen.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">The gastropub has become pervasive enough that the word alone invokes eye rolls; what the city could use more of is, simply, bars with great snacks. Sit in view of that window, pairing smaller plates with drinks from a roster of elegant cocktails—a citrusy Manhattan called the Greenpoint, say, or the Buckin’ Branca (featuring fernet), or, at brunch, an especially fiery Bloody Mary made with habanero and cilantro—and Allswell fits the bill.

He presented it with a flush of pride. “It’s . . . interesting,” she told him after her first sip. She took another, then traded it in for a glass of white wine. </p><p data-wc="179" word_count="179">But it is the exception when an experiment at Chop Shop fails. More often, the outcomes are toothsome and sophisticated—subtle takes on traditional Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese cuisine enlivened by unexpected ingredients and techniques. Salt-and-pepper quail arrives in crisp, golden pieces, the flavors succulent and surprising. Classics like sour <em>tom yum</em>, perfectly balanced Drunken Noodles, and irresistible pork buns—silky belly fat with Taiwanese-style ground peanuts floating on a buoyant cloud of dough—are executed with rare precision and, often, elevated by upscale proteins. Chicken with penang curry is built around a sliced, crispy pan-fried breast rather than the usual dull lumps of meat. Chop Shop Beef with Broccoli is refined as pan-seared short ribs with wonderfully sharp greens, though one longs for a slice of lime to cut the richness of the meat. The menu shifts regularly, but among the most satisfying standbys are the fried vegetable dumplings and the <em>zha jiang mian</em>: slightly greasy, nutty wheat noodles punctuated by cucumbers and brown beans in a lightly spicy pork sauce. The effect is both comforting and refreshing.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">Occasionally the cuisine, like the cocktails, gets weirder and faux-fancier than it needs to. <em>Laab</em>—a dish that usually thrills with crunch and fiery heat—was bland and underwhelming when reconfigured with cubed sea bass and pine nuts, served with lettuce cups. Service is inconsistent: the wait staff is very warm but not quite on top of it. And dessert is a nonevent, a choice of a couple flavors of ice cream and sorbet. But Chop Shop’s charms far outweigh its failings. The prices are low enough to take the sting out of the flops. It’s popular but generally not packed, serene but never dull, and ninety per cent of any given meal is delicious. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner and Sundays for dinner.

But perhaps most crippling to it and hundreds of other small downtown restaurants was the loss of power for nearly a week, which meant no refrigeration, and no customers. Now Bobwhite is back on its feet, thanks in part to the simplicity of its menu: fried chicken and catfish. Both are available either on a sandwich or as a supper plate, with a fluffy biscuit and a side of coleslaw. Occasionally, there are specials: a Buffalo-chicken sandwich was exactly what it sounded like—something a nineteen-year-old might concoct in a college dining hall—and just as satisfying, for about eight dollars. Not to be missed is the butterflied-pork-chop sandwich, which is surprisingly juicy and tender. The sandwich comes dressed with chowchow, a traditional Southern pickled-vegetable relish that adds brightness and tang.</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">In a city at risk of fried-chicken fatigue, Bobwhite distinguishes itself. Its meat is brined in sweet tea, and the skin is consistently crackling and crisp, with just enough pepper and spices to be both noticeable and memorable. The recipe favors dark meat—for the best experience, eat the thigh and the drumstick first. Fried catfish coated in cornmeal released steam upon first bite, and retained its flavor even amid a spicy remoulade. A variety of sides are available, but not all are created equal. Brunswick stew, a thick, tomato-based soup with vegetables, pork, and chicken, is a minor revelation—unassuming but mysteriously smoky—and collard greens with ham are dynamically spicy. Black-eyed peas come with chowchow, rather unexpectedly to some, and may go only half-eaten. Macaroni-and-cheese is unremarkable at best; instead, choose Cheddar grits, which do not reward patience—eat them fast, while they’re still soupy.</p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">The half-life of hot fried food is short, and the tiny dining space at Bobwhite does not permit it to travel far. All orders are available to go, but why delay gratification, thereby violating one of the main tenets of comfort food? The high tables and stools don’t invite customers to linger, but nobody seems to mind. One afternoon, a woman was lucky enough to place an order just as the chicken came out of the fryer, and no sooner had she taken off her jacket than her plate arrived at the table. “This must be a mistake,” she told her server, “but, if it isn’t, that was absurdly fast.” It’s good to have Bobwhite back in business.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/26/rosemarys	Rosemary’s	18 Greenwich Ave. 	41.7061248699043	-71.4632855477625	212-647-1818	2012/11/26	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="107" word_count="107">The West Village, in spite of the generally unreasonable real-estate prices, retains pockets of its original bohemian grit, and still feels like home to those who identify more strongly with Jane Jacobs than with Marc. In the space where a fire devastated the neighborhood shop Village Paper two years ago comes Rosemary’s, the second of Carlos Suarez’s restaurants to go straight from buzzy opening to perpetual scene (the first was Bobo). In the daytime, the large, lovely room—with high wood-beamed ceilings and picture windows looking onto the Jefferson Market Garden—belies the singles-playground atmosphere and egregious decibel levels that transform the place at night. </p><p data-wc="221" word_count="221">But there is good food to be had. The restaurant is named after Suarez’s mother, and the baroque, reasonably priced menu draws from the cuisine of her Tuscan home, balancing au-courant trends with playing it safe. Salumi—prosciutto di Parma, coppa cotta, sopressata—are impeccably sourced or house made. Focaccia, one slicked with lardo, another topped with mozzarella and tomato, are like fluffy pizzas. Ramekins of antipasti aim to showcase the harvest from the rooftop garden, and might include crisp radish shards, coated with creamy white butter, and lemony shredded cabbage with a chili kick. The chef, Wade Moises (of Eataly and Babbo), has a way with pastas, several of which are created on the premises. One night the smoky, creamy carbonara vied with the sweet oxtail-sauced cavatelli and a subtle pomodoro; <em>chitarra al burro</em>, served with the classic butter-Parmigiano-and-pepper combo, trumped them all. A rewarding meal can be made of any secondi—such as the <em>porchettina</em>, pink hunks of pork tenderloin with accents of fennel and mustard, or the crispy baked orata with grapefruit—paired with the exemplary rosemary potatoes. Occasionally, a dish feels like a failed experiment, such as the chopped salad Siciliana, in which the escarole is overpowered by sweet golden raisins and huge briny caperberries. But then its memory is erased by the ethereal rosemary-infused lemonade.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">A few weeks ago, just after the five-day Hurricane Sandy-induced blackout ended, the waitress made apologies for the limited offerings. But the menu seemed undiminished. The minestrone was like a garden in a bowl: baby turnips and carrots, tiny asparagus spears, tomatoes. In fact, diners can climb the stairs to peruse the garden, which in the November chill was lined with early lettuces and hardy herbs. It’s just a regular New York roof, a little grubby, and touchingly full of soul. (Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $12-$23.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/19/the-toucan-and-the-lion	The Toucan And the Lion	342 E. 6th St. 	33.5900973	-101.868105	212-375-8989	2012/11/19	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="127" word_count="127">You could call the Toucan and the Lion an Asian gastropub, but it might be more precise to say that it makes delicious food you never knew you wanted. Scotch eggs with lime aioli; a burger with cashew butter; burrata not with olive oil but with peanut-calamansi paste. This inspired, even audacious blend of culinary traditions has done a lot to enliven East Sixth Street’s Curry Row, which has lost some of its boisterous energy in recent years. The Toucan’s space is notably austere compared with its neighbors, and is ultra-modern in the way you might imagine a Singapore business-lunch joint to be, crammed with café tables so small that first dates are all but impossible since your knees touch awkwardly for the whole meal.</p><p data-wc="76" word_count="76">Half the restaurant is actually a bar, perpetually crowded, serving up remarkably successful riffs on the much maligned Asian-cocktail canon. No lychee Martinis here: instead, there’s a gingery margarita with a dollop of sriracha on top; an ambitious drink called a Tokyo Flip, made with egg whites and Yamakazi, the highly regarded Japanese whiskey; and a completely irresistible tequila-based creation called Crimson &amp; Clover, laced with a green-peppercorn simple syrup that dissolves into fresh muddled raspberries.</p><p data-wc="204" word_count="204">Freed from the tyranny of having to order everything at once (a policy on which so many other small-plates establishments insist), diners are encouraged to choose dishes as they go along. Among the “shares,” which are appetizer-sized and take up a large part of the menu, that peanut-spiked burrata is easily the best forkful of the night. It comes topped with shards of crispy prawn crackers—it’s just the kind of cheese with which you need some crunch. The burger is from the slightly squishy Shake Shack school, and is oozy with cashew butter. Another standout dish is the beef-short-rib tacos, which are dressed with aromatic dried curry, covered in queso fresco, and have a final unexpected bite of pickled shallot. Even the panna cotta makes a persuasive case for the resurrection of Asian fusion: it’s made with white chocolate, normally sickly sweet but barely discernible here beneath slivers of chile and the clean taste of pickled lychees. As with any good idea, and as with a lot of what’s on offer at the Toucan and the Lion, it’s hard to imagine why everyone’s not doing things this way. (Open for dinner every day except Tuesday. Entrées $16-$23.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/12/bistro-petit	Bistro Petit	170 S. 3rd St., Brooklyn 	40.7119305	-73.9612056	718-782-2582	2012/11/12	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="108" word_count="108">What’s in a name? In Bistro Petit, no more than necessary. The South Williamsburg restaurant is tiny, really, with just eleven counter seats and a few tables on the sidewalk, weather permitting, and serves food that is mostly French, though often seamlessly tinged with the flavors of Korea, the native country of the chef and owner, Sung Park. The name betrays a no-nonsense philosophy evident in every aspect of the place: the nowadays retro-seeming reservation policy, which is honored faithfully; the service, which is warm but unobtrusive, a triumph in such close quarters; and the atmosphere, marked by farmhouse décor and Benny Goodman on the stereo.</p><p data-wc="227" word_count="227">And then there’s the food. Anywhere on the menu is a good place to land—in late September, watermelon salad with grilled haloumi and fresh mint embodied the end of summer, while an artful composition of long-stemmed artichoke hearts with fava beans, niçoise olives, and red-pepper purée seemed perfect for any season. But certain dishes are transcendent. The kimchi bouillabaisse arrives in a cast-iron cauldron, its fragrant, spicy yet delicate red broth brimming with mussels, scallops, pollack, fried tofu, fermented cabbage, and chewy rice gnocchi, garnished with bright sprigs of watercress. A special of Beef Bourguignon Korean Style was comforting enough to evoke anyone’s grandmother, be she French, Korean, or neither: slick-sweet, falling-off-the-bone braised short ribs were sprinkled with freshly grated horseradish and nestled in a cast-iron skillet with glazed carrots, plump cipollini onions, crisp slices of Granny Smith apple, and golden chunks of crushed baked potato—delicious on their own but even better dragged through the last drips of pan sauce. At brunch, a French waffle, though topped with berries, mascarpone, and maple syrup, is made distinctively savory by the addition of Gruyère to its batter. Watch out, this may serve as a gateway to ordering pasta for breakfast. Park makes his by hand, then coats it with a luscious mix of crushed tomato, olive oil, garlic, fennel, pancetta, and broccolini.</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">Bistro Petit does not serve alcohol or tap water. But still and sparkling are available for purchase, and the staff is more than willing to pour whatever spirits you bring; Park himself might even sniff your cork. When, one recent night, the single server knocked a wineglass onto the floor, where it shattered, diners and kitchen staff alike erupted into a chorus of “Mazel tov!” Indeed, it felt like good luck to eat there. (Open Tuesdays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $17-$24.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/29/parish-hall	Parish Hall	109A N. 3rd St., Brooklyn 	38.658798	-90.1691899	718-782-2602	2012/10/29	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="149" word_count="149">Since the opening of the wildly popular brunch spot Egg, in 2005, Williamsburg has undergone extensive gentrification—the hipster’s natural habitat has been invaded by chains like Duane Reade and 16 Handles. So the arrival of Parish Hall, a new restaurant from George Weld and the rest of the team behind Egg, is a relief of the locally sourced, socially responsible variety. The new place is all grown up: while at Egg there are crayons for doodling on the white butcher-paper table covers, Parish Hall has colored pencils and sketchbooks, and instead of a half-hour wait reservations are available. The décor—if minimalist all-white can be called that—is airy and light, and the space is enormous, a far cry from Egg’s cramped quarters. There’s a bar, and a dining room, and even the menu has matured—beautiful things happen when George Weld stays open for dinner.</p><p data-wc="183" word_count="183">The food is a turn away from rib-sticking biscuits and gravy and toward the bounty of the garden, and some of the produce is supplied by Weld’s own Goatfell Farm, in the Catskills. One evening, a chilled corn soup came with basil and blackberries; a few weeks later they were raspberries. In a perfectly dressed salad of greens, prosciutto, shaved cauliflower, and pecans, peaches were later replaced by pears. Vegetables and fruits feature prominently, and many dishes come with a notable addition of nuts and grains. Crispy farro added texture and nutty flavor to a soft-boiled egg served with squash blossom, heirloom tomato, and turnip greens. Do not shy away from the duck with granola—it works. Even the meat dishes are prepared with an appreciation for the virtues of different cuts. Pork loin, shoulder, and rib arrive on the same plate, with yellow wax beans, fennel, peaches, and walnuts, and slices of duck breast are accompanied by leg meat, braised and seasoned with scallions and wrapped in ribbons of squash—it tastes like the best spring roll you’ve ever had.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">Parish Hall is more attentive than you’d expect a Williamsburg establishment to be—one weekend, a brunch order was misheard, and the table received complimentary loaves of lemon-cornmeal cake with blackberry ice cream. But don’t wait for the restaurant to make a mistake to try the desserts: the chocolate chess tart is filled with ingredients courtesy of Parish Hall’s next-door neighbors, the Mast Brothers, and is a must-order for any chocophile. When a slice of pear-and-Concord-grape tart came with a scoop of blue-cheese ice cream, the kids turned up their noses, and the adults dug in. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $22-$25.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/22/swine	Swine	531 Hudson St. 	42.3561888	-83.0837728	212-255-7675	2012/10/22	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="78" word_count="78">Bacon is the new black—or so reads the ironic T-shirt that would fit right in at Swine. In the upstairs bar of this split-level newcomer, you can start things off with a Pig in the City, a cocktail with a gimmicky name that, counterintuitively, improves on the classic Manhattan with apple bitters and bacon-infused rye. Downstairs, in the dining room, you can end your meal with a bacon-ice-cream hot-fudge sundae, which tastes better than it may sound.</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">The food, which is wonderful, trumps the atmosphere, which is not. (The stumble is a surprise, given that the restaurateur John McNulty, in partnership here with Cris Criswell, had a hand in such low-key West Village successes as Perilla and Joseph Leonard.) The décor is faux-dingy rock dive, with photographs of the Beastie Boys, the Dead Kennedys, and the Black Keys on the walls, and a pinball machine in the bar—but how many dives have a hundred-and-sixty-dollar bottle of sancerre on their wine list? At times, Swine strains for the kind of trailer-trash kitsch—a naked Pocahontas doll canoodles with a Wolverine figure above a banquette—that’s already the trademark of the Frito-pie-slinging Cowgirl Hall of Fame, which is situated on the same block. Then there’s the name Swine itself, not to be confused with the neighborhood’s more famous pig, which is spotted.</p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">The menu, from the chef Phil Conlon (Café Cluny), is extensive and doesn’t skimp on meatless options. Pescatarians could do far worse than the delicate house-cured gravlax or the Arctic-char crudo laced with cilantro oil and encircled by daubs of Greek yogurt and cucumber. A salad of heirloom cherry tomatoes arrives not with the predictable balsamic, mozzarella, and basil but brightened by orange zest and graced with a zucchini blossom stuffed with ricotta. One could also opt for all dairy, when ordering “the boards,” a selection of salumi, charcuterie, and cheeses, served with homemade condiments like arugula pesto and Espelette-pepper jam. But why skip the country paté or the creamy pork rillette—or, for that matter, the bacon marmalade?</p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">For those who prefer sharpened knives to forks, the swine chop beckons. Cooked to order—medium was springy and just the right shade of pink—the thick slab of meat is served with onion agrodolce, rustic crushed potatoes, al-dente green beans, and a zingy mustard jus. Carnivores who eat with their hands might go for the bone-marrow-and-brisket burger with melted Gruyère. But you can’t forego utensils when it comes to dessert—that bacon sundae requires a spoon. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $12-$28.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/15/hospoda	Hospoda	321 E. 73rd St. 	40.6285841985428	-73.9175484735883	212-861-1038	2012/10/15	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="169" word_count="169">Czechs like a nice big head on their beer, and as soon as you sit down at Hospoda, in the Bohemian National Hall, you are welcomed with a small glass of beer that is almost all head. The bubbles of froth are tiny, as in a cappuccino, and the effect is like a sweet, thin cream, with a sour edge of grain buried somewhere in the flavor. It’s called <em>mlíko</em>, meaning milk, and normally comes only from a keg’s first or last glass; here it’s produced by a special attachment on the tap that controls how much air enters the pour. This high-tech rendering of something traditional typifies the enterprise at Hospoda. The name means “pub,” but the room eschews nostalgia for something sparer. The walls feature a long, continuous mural cut into dark wood and lit from behind. Made by a Prague graffiti artist named Masker, it whimsically references national clichés—overflowing beer mugs, Škodas—that the restaurant itself seems anxious to avoid.</p><p data-wc="244" word_count="244">The menu, which changes monthly, curbs the stodgy, dumpling-prone proclivities of Czech fare, aiming at something sleekly international, albeit with one foot still in Central Europe. In early fall, it featured Hawaiian opah, possibly the world’s most un-Czech fish. The chef, Katie Busch, is attracted to unusual, slightly extreme flavors. Goat cheese on a green salad is not baked or grilled but deliberately singed. Often somewhat conventional elements are given a surreal twist. Slow-cooked chicken breast comes with black-currant foam, pea shoots, and a millet cake doused in acacia honey. You wouldn’t want to eat chicken like this every day, but it’s an enlivening experiment: the millet cake, with the honey caramelized on the bottom, gives the impression of a collision between dinner and breakfast. Sane dishes are available, too (poached lobster, veal schnitzel, duck-leg confit), and execution is uniformly excellent. There’s a bit of an over-reliance on foams and truffle oil, however, and it’s possible to wish for just a few more Czech classics. One of the most striking dishes is a variation on <em>obložené chlebíčky</em> (an open-faced sandwich with poached egg and Prague ham). Here the bread is split open, stuffed with ham, gherkin, and onion, dressed with egg on the outside, and fried. The result is somewhere between scrambled eggs and French toast, and even if you haven’t had many pilsners you can see it has the makings of a world-class hangover food.</p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">The Bohemian National Hall dates from the days when Yorkville had a big Czech diaspora, and in 2001 the Czech government took it over for use as a consulate. Hospoda, with its endearing mix of caprice and earnestness, shares this sense of cultural ambassadorship. The place is often busiest right after work, when consular employees crowd in, evidently keen to maintain their statistical lead: Czechs consume the most beer per capita of any nation on earth. (Open daily for dinner and Sundays for brunch. Main courses $25-$39.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/08/calliope	Calliope	84 E. 4th St. 	33.5907077	-101.8395576	212-260-8484	2012/10/08	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="154" word_count="154">A restaurant situated at East Fourth Street and Second Avenue seems like the sort of place where you can expect to have a bad brunch. Maybe it’s the proximity of so many halfhearted Irish pubs, but the lower reaches of the East Village have not been synonymous with culinary ambition. Calliope, a perky new French bistro on this corner, aims higher than Bloody Marys and gloopy hollandaise. In fact, the menu is so glamorous, so unabashedly retro, that it seems like the sort of food that might have been served in the first-class cabin on an Air France flight in the late sixties. There is no stomach-lining truffle mac and cheese, no burger, not even any elaborate six-ingredient cocktails. Instead, there are terrines, tarts, tripe, and rabbit, with a small selection of mixed drinks so classic they require no explanation. In other words, grownup food, which arrives as a whisper, not a shout.</p><p data-wc="196" word_count="196">The very existence of a bar menu is always a cause for celebration, even if it’s just some warm mixed nuts. It’s civilized, generous: the right thing to do. At Calliope, the snacks menu features one of the restaurant’s most irresistible offerings: the accurately named eggs mayonnaise with celery salt, which turns out to be so much more than the sum of its parts, thanks to the mayo, which is lemony and airy, a totally different thing from the kind in a jar. Another polarizing ingredient gets its moment of glory when toast spread with olive oil and anchovy paste comes to the table in place of the standard bread basket. The kind of restaurant that serves anchovies without being asked is by its nature a brave one, and some of Calliope’s main courses can even seem a little intimidating, such as a hot-and-sour braised lamb neck, falling off the bone and served in a surprisingly delicate stew of its own juices. There are little chewy packages of mascarpone<em> agnolotti</em> bobbing around in there, too—as with the marshmallows in a bowl of Lucky Charms, you’ll find yourself searching for them.</p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">Each component on every plate seems to have been considered carefully: one night, farm lettuces, piled high, tossed with feta and scallion, were so unerringly crisp it was as though the chef had hand-picked them, while the leeks in an unusual seafood terrine were artfully slow-cooked to the point where they tasted as sweet as the lobster. The waitstaff all seemed to get dreamy looks when asked about their favorites. Most answered the same thing: the apricot crème panisse, another complicated-sounding dish that turned out to be brilliantly simple. It’s essentially a crème brûlée without the brûlée, topped instead with an apricot compote. All the guests at one table agreed that it reminded them of Bonne Maman jam, in the best possible way, and the sound of spoons scraping up the last bits of custard could be heard even above the din of Second Avenue. (Open Mondays for dinner, Tuesdays through Fridays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $17-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/01/mission-chinese-food	Mission Chinese Food	154 Orchard St. 	41.6277939	-83.5542957	212-529-8800	2012/10/01	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="155" word_count="155">Danny Bowien, the thirty-year-old Korean-born chef and main owner of Mission Chinese Food, grew up in Oklahoma eating the Chinese dishes of Middle America, fried rice and lo mein. After stints at white-tablecloth restaurants in New York and San Francisco, Bowien wanted to cook at a place where he and his friends would actually eat on their day off, i.e., cheap and gutsy. He started experimenting—tasting his way through San Francisco’s Chinatown—and took over an existing Chinese joint in the Mission district, which went on to incite widespread cultish devotion. For his much ballyhooed outpost here, he chose a curious Lower East Side space that has housed more than one failed Asian expansion project (Bia Garden, Rhong-Tiam). The room, down a dim hallway/kitchen-viewing galley, isn’t much to look at—Chinese propaganda poster, big gold dragon—but it doesn’t matter, because the food is the star of the show.</p><p data-wc="189" word_count="189">Bowien took cues from the tried-and-true tradition of greasy Chinese-American food and one-upped it for some of his best dishes: Kung Pao Pastrami (house-smoked meat, celery, peanuts, red hot chilis); Thrice Cooked Bacon (poached, steamed, and wok-fried—“It’s like super-bacon,” an ardent fan marvelled); Broccoli Beef Brisket (fat-laced slabs of brisket and Chinese broccoli, doused in garlicky smoked-oyster sauce). The heat of Mapo Tofu—large cubes of silken bean curd tossed with equally large hunks of pork shoulder—spreads like fire in your mouth and stays awhile. Bowien’s spiciest dishes inspire discussions of various hot peppers: “Like, you know, that black one. The one that coats your mouth and numbs it, like novocaine,” one member of Bowien’s target audience mused. “Married Couple’s” Beef (tongue, heart, and tripe) produced a split decision—“It’s kind of cold and slimy, right?” a woman said with a “yuck” face, to which her husband replied, “Mmm, so soft.” Excellent lamb breast, with a crunchy cumin crust, served with pickled beans and charred dates, comes on little bones, good for picking up and gnawing—a delicate treat for Bamm-Bamm Rubble.</p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">The food assaults, and yet kindness abounds. The nearly inevitable wait for dinner (two or three hours at prime time, unless you e-mail ahead for a reservation) is made more pleasant by a free kegger. The restaurant donates seventy-five cents from every entrée to the Food Bank for New York City. The general manager, making the rounds one evening, talked about answering a Craigslist ad that stated, “Must speak Cantonese” (originally, there were to be Cantonese cooks, but it didn’t end up that way), which led to a couple of weeks in San Francisco, to learn the ropes. When asked about the difference between New York and San Francisco patrons, he demurred: “New Yorkers are nicer.” (Open for lunch and dinner every day but Wednesday. Large dishes $6-$15.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/24/reynards	Reynards	80 Wythe Ave., Brooklyn 	40.7219036	-73.9580607	718-460-8000	2012/09/24	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="121" word_count="121">If you haven’t been to Williamsburg in a while, it’s possible that you still picture the grimy hipster paradise of its recent past, a land of cigarettes and tattoos, well vodka and ironic hairdos. There’s still plenty of that buzzing around Bedford Avenue, but if you have yet to experience the artisanal cocktails and gentrified chic of the newer, richer, more grownup Williamsburg that has emerged along the East River, there is no better introduction than dinner at Reynards. The surprisingly good restaurant inside the new Wythe Hotel is the latest offering from Andrew Tarlow, who has been curating this milieu since 1998, at his South Williamsburg restaurants Diner and Marlow &amp; Sons, and at Roman’s, in Fort Greene.</p><p data-wc="187" word_count="187">This is Brooklyn, so the ingredients are ethically sourced and the bathrooms are unisex. One summer night, the menu, which changes almost daily, included a sublime bluefish appetizer—cool, cured, very fresh filets served with mint and crème fraîche—a subtle and refreshing chilled fennel soup, and grilled char served with bright pea shoots and fresh basil in a bracing brine (the flavors were surprising, and so was the price: $14). A spinach salad arrived with croutons so buttery they were like an entirely new food, crowned by just enough bacon lardons to wilt and flavor the salad without turning it into out-and-out junk food. The excellent sides included a tower of green asparagus buttressed by pieces of Parmesan and decorated with morels and caramelized-rhubarb sauce, and kohlrabi with golden raisins and puréed broccoli, a poached egg perched on top of the pile. Upon hearing that a table wanted a white wine that “tastes like grass,” the cheerful, chatty sommelier brought out a crisp and vaguely fizzy white Aligoté from Viti Vini Vinci, with a naked fat man lounging on the label. It was perfect.</p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">The service at Reynards is, in general, friendly and loose. Though they couldn’t find a reservation for four one Friday night, they compensated with so much warmth and comped wine that all was forgiven. In some ways, Reynards offers what one wishes a dining experience in Manhattan would be: kindness instead of attitude, inoffensive prices, glorious food, and aesthetic variety—the clientele is split roughly in half between the stylish and the schlumpy. If your tolerance for Brooklyn preciousness is low, limit yourself to dinner and resist the urge to check out the hotel rooms upstairs: they are lovely in a reclaimed-wood-and-exposed-brick kind of way, but the twee factor is pretty intense. As the proprietors put it on their Web site, “Wythe has rooms for artists, friends, brewmasters, musicians, concertgoers, mothers, brothers, grandmothers, bowlers, interns, engineers, chefs &amp; viogniers.” At Reynards, though, you don’t feel like part of a parody, you just feel lucky to be there.

Up front is a sprawling deli counter of meats and cheeses, freshly baked bread, and imported oils and vinegars, as well as a small bar that houses orange juice and coffee machines along with the hard stuff. In the lower-level dining room, the right balance of tile, exposed brick, and copper pots lends a rustic minimalism. The efficient use of square footage and enticing market clutter are features any New Yorker can appreciate, but unlike most restaurants decorated with cans of imported tomatoes and cured sausages, you may consider buying something here. The artisanal dry goods are a mix of local (hand-labelled bottles of upstate maple syrup) and imported (Sicilian anchovies in salt)—the stuff gift baskets are made of.</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">Throughout the day, casual patrons can stop in for sandwiches on ethereal, cloud-like focaccia, or homemade gelato. By night, the place is packed with a stiffer clientele—think blazers and silk dresses—whose collective temperament is discordant with the atmosphere of mealtime relaxation. Even the food looks at ease—the breezy, colorful plating is ready for its country-cookbook closeup. One week, an early-summer appetizer of tender bison tartare came with mint and bright-green chickpeas; a few weeks later, it was accompanied by favas and watercress. Skip the gem lettuces, a sort of deconstructed salad; for fourteen dollars, there aren’t enough white anchovies. A diner appraising the fried artichokes (“That looks like the potpourri in my mom’s bathroom!”) discovered they tasted much better than they looked. Rich <em>jamón ibérico</em> is sliced to perfection but costs about twice as much as it should. Instead, get the house-made <em>salumi</em>, with buttery ribbons of pancetta and aromatic <em>finocchiona</em>.</p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">There’s a strong selection of pastas, some of them house-made and others imported brands like Gentile, one of the oldest pasta-makers in Italy. Heavenly hunks of slow-roasted short rib, peppercorn-crusted and topped with freshly grated horseradish, come in parchment on wooden slabs. Whole roasted fish (branzino or turbot) are reliably flaky and tender, served with caramelized lemon. Slices of juicy <em>porchetta</em> were, in midsummer, accompanied by a bright palette of grilled peaches, pickled red onions, and a fresh-herb salad. A cracker-like garnish that appeared to be a bread stick was in fact crispy pork skin, which added the perfect crunch. On a recent Monday night, two women walked in only to be turned away—the house was full. “Oh well, I’d rather go to Italy,” one woman sighed to her friend. Someone should tell her that dinner reservations, unlike plane tickets, are free. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dishes $12-$38.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/10/yunnan-kitchen	Yunnan Kitchen	79 Clinton St. 	38.6081023613126	-89.6080870315779	212-253-2527	2012/09/10	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="172" word_count="172">Just a few blocks east of Essex Street, just a few degrees west of authentic Chinese cuisine, Yunnan Kitchen straddles the border of Chinatown and the Lower East Side both literally and figuratively. Easy fodder for cynics—who needs precious “small plates” when you can still get five dumplings for a dollar down on Mosco Street?—but it’s hard not to fall for the playful innovation of the menu, derived loosely from a food tour the owner and the chef took through China to sample Yunnan cuisine, previously underrepresented in Manhattan. The tapas-style dishes, which tend to arrive in rapid succession, are divided into four categories—cold, hot, <em>shao kao</em> (from the grill), and rice &amp; noodles—and described plainly: “braised beef rolls–mint, cucumber,” “scrambled egg–jasmine flowers, cherry tomatoes,” “spicy pork.” Some don’t surpass this simplicity; “lamb meatballs,” for example, are just that, on skewers, and not particularly exciting. And the jasmine flowers in the perfectly scrambled eggs, though satisfyingly unusual, are not as transcendent as one might hope.</p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">Others, though, exceed expectations. A dish of wood-ear mushrooms, gingko nuts, celery, and lily bulbs is delightfully reminiscent of pasta, the fibrous mushrooms like hand-torn flat noodles, the gingko nuts as pliant as gnocchi. “Want my heads?” one diner asked another, on a recent evening, while shelling whole shrimp. These come sprinkled with fried lime leaves, which melt on the tongue and taste, in the best possible way, like Froot Loops. Chicken, too often pigeonholed as boring, stands out: a tangle of cold, tangy tamarind-marinated shreds is mounded on a pedestal of rich, sweet, mashed purple taro and garnished with crispy taro matchsticks; tender chunks are stir-fried with lemongrass, Chinese celery, scallions, and sweet-bun croutons.</p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">Dessert is not offered at the moment (nor are cocktails; only wine and beer), but the back of the menu features a tantalizing list of hot and iced teas. Light, refreshing iced chrysanthemum comes in a pitcher big enough to serve four, with honey and mint syrup on the side. Hot Pu’erh Poe, poured from a porcelain pot into mismatched mugs, has a coffee-like consistency and a complex, earthy flavor. Sipping slowly is a welcome meditation at the end of a somewhat frenzied meal, and provides a chance to drink in the restaurant’s subtle décor, marked by sleek blond and black wood, simple ceramic tableware, and a display of Yunnan jewelry that looks like it could be on loan from the Met. What appears to be a framed tiger skin may inspire double takes, from across the room—is it authentic? It’s not, but as with the food, it doesn’t matter; it works. (Open for dinner every night but Tuesday. Small plates $5-$13.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/03/catch-3	Catch	21 Ninth Ave. 	-29.7865615	30.8904598	212-392-5978	2012/09/03	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="95" word_count="95">Why have one hostess when you can have four? At Catch, a typically cavernous restaurant in the meatpacking district—surely the only neighborhood in New York where you wish the restaurants would take up a little <em>less</em> space—the answer is that more is always more. Hence the velvet rope and two bouncers on the way in, the juiced-up samba version of “Move on Up” playing inside, the twenty-five-dollar tequila cocktail, and the grab-bag menu of dishes from around the world, governed by the principle that most, though not all, of it should be seafood. </p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">Spinning on the lazy Susan at any given point, there might be the Italian-American classic cioppino stew (thick with tomato pulp but served in a stingy shallow bowl), some sushi rolls (including a dried-coconut-encrusted Zulu roll), a chunk of “simply cooked” salmon or mahi-mahi (served à la carte, with the sauce, naturally, on the side), and, with any luck, a crispy whole snapper (done in the traditional Thai style, curved in on itself and covered in chili and garlic). It’s the best thing on the menu, but it’s also seventy-two dollars.</p><p data-wc="190" word_count="190">For those without expense accounts, simpler pleasures are hard to find. The hot, soft pretzels with honey-mustard butter don’t have a lot to do with seafood, but no one will complain. On the appetizer menu, there are some spicy tuna rice cakes that are appropriately crispy on the bottom and satisfyingly laborious for the jaw muscles, like good pizza crust, or nougat. Hamachi tartare with pear and potato chips works better than expected; in fact, this cleanest of fish provides a neat staging ground for the delightfully weird intermingling of salty and sweet, crunchy and mushy. The high-low dessert offerings sound like they should be cheap, but they aren’t, of course. The big draw of the cookie bucket is the fried Oreo, which doesn’t really taste like anything, except maybe tempura. The s’mores pizza is heavy on the cinnamon and comes with a little tub of burnt-marshmallow ice cream, from which you’re instructed to scoop your own. It’s diverting, though not delicious, and, like the over-all dining experience, feels dated, and a little too determinedly “downtown.” (Open every night for dinner. Entrées $26-$90.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/27/brooklyn-crab	Brooklyn Crab	24 Reed St., Red Hook 	40.6753603	-74.0165402	718-643-2722	2012/08/27	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="139" word_count="139">The haters came on early and strong for this venturesome tri-level seafood shack in Red Hook. Almost immediately upon Brooklyn Crab’s opening, in June, Yelp reviews collectively deemed it one of the worst restaurants in Brooklyn, mostly owing to poor service, high prices, and epic waits. It was as if New Yorkers had been hoping for so long for such a place—sure, there are lobster rolls on every corner, but what about a proper crab boil and seafood galore somewhere near the water?—that nothing could possibly live up to their fantasies. But, if you listen to the disgruntled Yelpers, you might be deterred from a rare experience: mini-golf and beer as a prelude to fresh cold oysters and perfectly steamed lobster, eaten in the open, relatively salty air, with a killer view of New York Harbor. </p><p data-wc="253" word_count="253">The owners, Jamie Vipond and Matthew Bohner—who also run the rooftop Mexican restaurant Alma—double as woodworkers, and, according to a server, built the place. The structure, reminiscent of a D.I.Y. Cape Hatteras stilt house, is impressively grand in spite of all the raw wood and cement. On the ground floor, there’s that eighteen-hole mini-golf course, a beanbag toss, and a pool table next to a porpoise-and-orca mural airbrushed onto corrugated steel. The charming salty-dog second-floor bar works overtime to appease the waiting hordes, who gaze longingly at the lucky ones already seated. The food, served in metal trays and plastic baskets on picnic tables, is simple and fresh, sourced from the Eastern seaboard. A large party should order big—the Super Cool Platter has peel-and-eat shrimp (juicy and sweet), Sewansecott oysters, from Virginia (a bit puny), or Malpeques, from Prince Edward Island (nice and big), king-crab legs (a little dry), and Maine lobster (just right). Steam pots have more of the same, but hot, with corn and potatoes. Fried Ipswich belly clams are succulent, crab cakes are the wet Maryland style, the wedge salad is drenched in dressing. Get the blue crabs if you’re in the mood for a project—they’re a lot of work for a little payoff. (And even less when they’re dusted with not enough Old Bay.) An aspirational dish of plump seared scallops with bacon-laced kale and a Hamptons vibe seems out of place, but is no less delicious for it.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">The savvy staff has learned that communication is the key to a happy relationship, and one evening, a solicitous waiter divulged that a simple design flaw is the cause of those onerous waits: the kitchen is too small to keep up. So far, that hasn’t stopped hipsters young and old from flooding the place, and the restaurant is already advertising a “Sunday football special,” with assurance that the upper deck will be “fully enclosed and heated, with spectacular harbor views.” That warm summer night, as the sky turned pink behind the Statue of Liberty to the west, a Manhattanite looked to the east and cried gleefully, “I see Ikea!” (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/13/biang	Biang!	41-10 Main St., Flushing 	null	null	null	2012/08/13	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="137" word_count="137">If restaurants were rock bands, a food-loving musician suggested recently, Xi’an Famous Foods might be Nirvana circa 1991, the year punk broke. For years, this food stall in a basement mall, serving western-Chinese food, was Flushing’s most famous underground act, drawing devotees from Manhattan, who stood in line for cumin lamb burgers and <em>liáng pí</em>—“cold skin” wheat noodles served with spongy cubes of gluten and a spicy sauce, whose addictive properties have inspired comparisons to crack. Media attention followed (an appearance on Anthony Bourdain’s “No Reservations” was the equivalent of an MTV video), and, finally, it went mainstream: recently, Xi’an opened outposts in Chinatown and on St. Mark’s Place, where N.Y.U. students and skater types crowd the takeout lines. Its original foodie fans were left feeling a little bereft.</p><p data-wc="231" word_count="231">The force behind the growing Xi’an empire is Jason Wang, a twenty-four-year-old Washington University graduate who now runs the restaurants with his father. Wang has stadium-size ambitions—including a food truck and a centralized “factory” kitchen to supply more outposts—but, in the meantime, he has taken a detour back to Flushing, opening Biang! on Main Street. Unlike its sibling restaurants, with their lines and numbered food pictures on the wall, Biang! is a sleek, sit-down affair. (Biang, the name of the restaurant’s signature noodle, mimics the sound the noodles make when they are being snapped into shape.) Biang!’s menu has all the staples, including those cold-skin noodles, but with an even more traditional bent. The simple chicken skewers, spiced with cumin, are an instant crowd-pleaser. But boiled-beef-stomach skewers, dressed with sesame paste and Szechuan peppers, have a more challenging (i.e., stomach-y) aftertaste. In place of lamb’s-face salad—a Xi’an item whose kicky combination of cilantro, celery, and lamb meat tends to linger on the brain—comes a dish described, graphically, as “cooked lamb cheeks, tongue, eyeballs, and palate meat served with bean sprouts, cilantro, celery, scallion, cucumber.” It’s delicious—tangy and refreshing—but, yes, that chewy white morsel is a lamb eyeball. Unconvinced? Then stick with the surprisingly nutty fiddlehead ferns, prepared with black vinegar, Szechuan peppercorn oil, and garlic—an instant classic.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Biang! is still working out its kinks. A quail dish—the result of a stint Wang did at the French Culinary Institute—is a nice thought, but it tastes too bland in this spicy company. The restaurant is waiting on its liquor license, and these oily noodle dishes cry out for beer. Console yourself with dessert: the fermented-rice egg-drop soup tastes, intriguingly, like a bowl of lumpy, cold sake. The Xi’an Famous empire might have mass appeal, but it hasn’t sold out.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/06/super-linda	Super Linda	109 W. Broadway 	41.2611835	-95.9140798	212-227-8998	2012/08/06	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="158" word_count="158">If you like humiliation and habañeros, then Super Linda, in Tribeca, is for you. It is not enough to merely secure a reservation at Matt Abramcyk’s newest establishment. (His other clubby spots include Warren 77, Smith &amp; Mills, and Tiny’s, and he ran the Beatrice Inn before it closed, in 2009.) One must arrive ready for abasement, which is served with considerable creativity. There is, of course, an intimidating bouncer stationed outside the front door, and a beautiful young hostess inside who manages to make the question “May I help you?” sound truly cruel. But that’s nothing new. One Friday night, a pair of diners found themselves staring longingly at an open two-top for thirty minutes after the appointed hour of their reservation when a chic host with tiny dreadlocks approached the couple, not to offer consolation or a round of drinks but to remark, “You really should check that,” pointing to their insufficiently glamorous gym bag. </p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">Diners are rewarded for their fortitude with food and beverages of a pan-Latin bent, a fusion of Argentine and Uruguayan from Abramcyk’s partners, Serge Becker and Richard Ampudia, of La Esquina. A forty-dollar rib eye accompanied by braised kale and roasted fingerling potatoes was nothing special; ditto for prawns served with smoked tomato, avocado, and rice. The best of Super Linda’s offerings are the bar-snack-style starters, like the perky <em>tostada de esquites</em>, a little pile of corn and cotija cheese topped with lime-spiked house-made mayonnaise on tiny crunchy tortillas, and the shrimp balls, with <em>chile de árbol</em> and cilantro. Inexplicably, an Italian entrée—chicken Milanese—has migrated onto the menu, and many of the vegetable sides seem similarly not quite South American. Regardless of their origin, the sweet and nicely crisp fried Brussels sprouts with toasted almonds and chile peppers are an excellent and unexpected addition.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">But food is not really the point here. Super Linda is a place to watch rich men flirt with young women and buy them tasty drinks with funny names, like the Alex Comfort (rum, sloe gin, orange juice, and bitters) and Blue Skies, No Candy (tequila, gin, apricot liqueur, and Cocchi Americano). The space is fetching, with glowing lanterns illuminating a diner-like décor of gleaming green tiles and comfortable maroon booths. Once you are finally seated, the place offers a certain preposterous charm. Just don’t arrive hungry, and leave any frumpy totes—or friends—behind, and you may enjoy the novelty of a Savage Detective (a mezcal Old Fashioned with sherry, maple syrup, and charred pineapple) amidst the buzzy blend of flirting, texting, and social climbing that is Abramcyk’s signature dish. (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $18-$40.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/perla-2	Perla	24 Minetta Lane 	40.73050445	-74.0012474783562	212-933-1824	2012/07/30	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="146" word_count="146">It’s no surprise that dinner at Gabriel Stulman’s new West Village restaurant starts with a twist on two American classics: potato chips and P. B. &amp; J. After all, the mini empire he’s established in the neighborhood since 2009 (Joseph Leonard, Jeffrey’s Grocery, Fedora) is staffed by so many Wisconsinites that it’s called Little Wisco. But the bustling, banquette-lined Perla is strictly Italian. So what gives? Skip the scoffing and order. When the bowl of golden, crisp chips lands on the table, dusted all’amatriciana—a powdery update of the classic sauce of guanciale, pecorino, and tomato—you’ll rue the day you ever disrespected your palate with barbecue-flavored Lay’s. Take a bite of the tramezzini of foie gras, cherry jam, and pistachio butter on finger-size slices of crustless white bread and it’s clear: Stulman has another hit on his hands. </p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">On one recent evening, a table of Italian-American epicures was ready to be a tough crowd. What was the provenance of the olive oil? A Sicilian variety was whisked out from the kitchen and met with grudging nods of approval. By the time the questions extended to water—why pour San Pellegrino and not the superior Lurisia?—the waiter replied by raising an eyebrow. The interrogation ended when the pasta arrived. Perla serves eight different kinds, all made in-house. Cavatelli was sauced with a duck-rich ragù and topped, in a table-side flourish, with shavings from a frozen block of foie gras. Strands of black tagliatelle were flecked with succulent peekytoe crab and sweet cubanella peppers. Spaghetti, with a medley of rock shrimp, tomato, and basil, was deemed too acidic by one fussy eater; her delighted neighbor polished off the rest of the plate. </p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">Save room for secondi. The whole roasted branzino, one of three dishes from the wood-burning oven, was salt-spangled on the outside and delicate inside, its fragrance enhanced by lemony yogurt and a brown-butter zabaglione. The twenty-four-hour steak (poached for a whole day) was perfectly medium rare—Perla’s chef, Michael Toscano, earned his stripes at Eataly’s meat emporium, Manzo—and attended by bone-marrow agrodolce, which prompted one diner to launch into an ad-hoc tutorial on the role of sweet-and-sour in ancient Roman cuisine. After a meal this rich, one begins to understand why the Romans ate while reclining, and lighter dessert options beckon, like the silky disk of panna cotta or the fresh berry sorbetto. Thanks to the Emperor Nero for demanding that snow be brought down from the mountains and flavored with fruit. (Open every night for dinner and Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays for lunch. Dishes $10-$35.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/23/joanne-trattoria	Joanne Trattoria	70 W. 68th St. 	40.722208	-73.8945859	212-721-0068	2012/07/23	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="121" word_count="121">Joanne Trattoria is a simple mom-and-pop outfit, but the mom and pop in question are Joseph and Cynthia Germanotta, the parents of Lady Gaga. The music idol is not involved in the restaurant, but it has other celebrity connections. In the kitchen is Art Smith, who for years was Oprah Winfrey’s personal chef. The aim is clearly to create a typical family-style place serving unpretentious Italian fare. The dishes are named for relatives like “Papa G” and “Aunt Josephine,” the staff are loquacious and friendly, and the walls are hung with what look like family photos and some impressively hideous Mediterranean landscapes. The over-all effect, surely intentional, is of the sort of place Joey from “Friends” would take a date.</p><p data-wc="229" word_count="229">The meal starts auspiciously, if far from healthily, with a homemade focaccia that is basically a meal in itself, topped with caramelized onions and crumbled Pecorino and drizzled with what seems like an olive grove’s worth of oil. It is good in the same way that the garlic bread at Domino’s is good. Also creditable are staples like lasagna, an overwhelming paving-stone slab of meat and ricotta with micro-greens on top. But more ambitious dishes go uniformly awry. Osso buco is more or less just osso, and such bone marrow as there seems to be is oddly chewy. The squid in the grilled-calamari salad, though bearing the browned marks of grilling, has none of the charcoal richness you might expect—indeed, it has almost no flavor at all. The mixed leaves on which it sits look suspiciously like the prepared salad you’d buy in a bag at the supermarket. On the menu a few weeks back, there was something described as “Art’s healthy selection of the day,” which turned out to be grilled chicken breast, penne, and broccoli rabe, with a tangy pasta sauce on the side. However, the chicken was bland and a little dry. It was as if the dish had been dreamt up to discredit the idea of healthy food altogether—a supposition strengthened when it disappeared from the menu soon after.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">The restaurant draws a convivial multigenerational crowd. One recent Friday, a graduation party was taking place on a patio at the back as a grandfatherly figure entered exclaiming, “What a place! I love New York.” Weekend brunch draws groups of young girls chaperoned by their mothers, excitedly tweeting their friends about Lady Gaga. Brunch features a dish that’s billed as “Art’s famous fried chicken and waffles.” It comes with bourbon-infused maple syrup. Perhaps it ought to be called “Art’s unhealthy option” instead. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner, Wednesdays through Sundays for lunch, and weekends for brunch. Main courses $18-$38.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/09/la-promenade-des-anglais	La Promenade Des Anglais	461 W. 23rd St. 	29.8070113673469	-95.4050373877551	212-255-7400	2012/07/09	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="108" word_count="108">Zucchini-flower beignets: the prospect of blossom fritters brightened a recent muggy afternoon, and for a while obscured thoughts of other dishes that might appear at dinner that night, at La Promenade des Anglais, Alain Allegretti’s homage to his home town of Nice. The beignets were supposedly a signature touch, and sounded like just the thing to ease the onset of summer in the city. “Sorry, they are the one thing we don’t have tonight,” the waiter said, when the table started in on its choices. So it goes with ephemeral ingredients, and yet a note of disappointment had been struck, like a string out of tune.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">The room, on the ground floor of the massive London Terrace apartment complex, is a confident, if self-conscious, homage to La Prom, as the Niçois call their seaside boardwalk, the restaurant’s namesake. The booth benches are upholstered in Baie des Anges <em>bleu;</em> the ceiling is painted with patterns evoking umbrellas and palms. The brass fixtures bring to mind one of those mid-scale seafood restaurants with a nautical theme. All that’s missing is a binnacle. You could venture that this bistro is a snazzy Manhattan version of such a place, bustling with aging Chelsea gents instead of Sunday drivers in polyester slacks. If London Terrace were a cruise ship, this would be its first-class smoking lounge. At one point, the smell of laundry drifted into the dining room, a whiff of steerage.</p><p data-wc="222" word_count="222">Allegretti, a classically trained Ducasse acolyte and a handsome “Iron Chef” contestant, seems to have in mind an affordable, casual incarnation of his previous restaurant, Allegretti, which failed to navigate the recession. There are signs of schizophrenia, only some of which are attributable to the Franco-Italian mélange of the Côte d’Azur and of Allegretti’s upbringing, on both sides of the border. Strokes of precision chefliness—for example, a deliciously fishy Provençale fish soup with no discernible fish in it—can seem conspicuous in a place where waiters take your wine hostage, and then suddenly sneak up to pour some of it in a glass you have just thirstily half-filled with water. The food and the service, whether out of laziness or bad luck, can seem uneven. Roasted (and fried) baby artichokes, drizzled with olive oil and anchovy paste, conjured Vieux Nice; fried gnocchi summoned up good ol’ Tater Tots. A cube of cod, speckled with bits of sausage and red pepper (“Riviera style,” the menu tells us), was an exquisite piece of fish, no two ways. Tasting a few flakes, along with an unadulterated sip or two of wine (just back from an undisclosed location), banished any lingering recollection of a zucchini-blossom shortage or industrial dryers tumbling London Terrace linens. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $17-$30.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/francesca	Francesca	17 Clinton St. 	38.608962167245	-89.6078916247574	212-253-2303	2012/07/02	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="114" word_count="114">Diners at a new restaurant in the space that formerly housed Frankies Spuntino 17 may find themselves preoccupied by an ambivalent déjà vu. The owners remain the same: Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli (together known as the Frankies), New York’s kings of the casual Italian snack, or <em>spuntino</em>, so well known that they’ve bottled an eponymous brand of extra-virgin olive oil. After establishing locations in Brooklyn and then on the Lower East Side, they expanded their marinara-and-meatballs empire to the West Village. Now, in their first departure from Italian food, the Frankies have reincarnated the Clinton Street location as a Basque-inflected Spanish cognate, with a small menu from the chef Ryan Bartlow.</p><p data-wc="96" word_count="96">Where once there were crostini, now there are <em>pintxos</em>—bar snacks, served on slices of bread. The old ones were well toasted, but the new ones are only sometimes crisp. Gloopy toppings, like egg salad with anchovies, or <em>brandada de bacalao</em>, an emulsion of salt cod and potato, can make for messy handoffs (there is only one piece per order), but a side of extra bread helps sop up spills. Creamed leeks over quince paste and sheep’s-milk cheese come piled high with a tower of cured-ham shavings, creating a structural challenge with a sweet-savory reward.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The careful simplicity of the menu sometimes results in a bland dining experience. Fideuà, a Valencian noodle dish served without any meat or seafood, is less like the paella it is compared with in the menu’s glossary than like a thin macaroni and cheese. <em>Jamón ibérico</em>, a Spanish ham known for its marbling, was sliced so thin as to sublimate much of the nutty flavor; La Quercia Rossa prosciutto, from the American Midwest, upstaged the imported ham with its deep-red color and rich, silky texture. The bravest order is, as it happens, the most flavorful: a chopped salad of dime-size coins of chilled, braised octopus with chives and red peppers.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">Among the limited selection of more substantial dishes, <em>patatas riojanas</em>, a traditional northern stew, is well balanced, with onions, spicy chorizo, and <em>pimentón</em>, a peppery Spanish spice like paprika, but it’s ultimately a straightforward meat-and-potatoes dish. The most notable risk that Francesca takes is encouraging patrons to drink sherry with dinner instead of wine (one waitress joked, “It’s not your grandmother’s sherry,” as if that were a selling point). There’s nothing wrong with simplicity or grandmothers, of course, but suggesting that diners forego wine in favor of the sweet stuff bespeaks an eagerness bordering on impatience to show off what Francesca knows about Spain.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/25/pok-pok-ny	Pok Pok Ny	127 Columbia St., Brooklyn 	40.68730275	-74.0013265828431	718-923-9322	2012/06/25	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="184" word_count="184">When the chef Andy Ricker chose the location for the New York branch of Pok Pok, his Southeast Asian restaurant in Portland, Oregon, he went a bit off the beaten path, to the Columbia Street Waterfront. Pok Pok Ny would be lower-key than its wildly popular Portland counterpart, more of a neighborhood spot. Nice try: you can run from the food bloggers, but you can’t hide. Aside from the beachy décor—laminate walls, kitschy plastic tablecloths, flickering lights—there is nothing relaxed about Pok Pok Ny. It’s dining as sport, beginning with what can be a two-hour wait, followed by a frenzied huddle over the menu, which lists two dozen dishes, each more tantalizing and involved than the last. It’s wise to assign a captain, to oversee selection, prevent overzealous ordering, and request appropriate coursing, lest everything arrive at once. For hydration, there is water flavored with pandanus leaf, which tastes pleasantly of toasted rice, and fruit-flavored drinking vinegars, which, mixed with seltzer, are like sweet-and-sour sodas. Brusque hosts and servers, armed with walkie-talkies, dart around the restaurant like referees.</p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">If all this sounds a little high-stakes, take comfort in the fact that the food lives up to the hype. An obvious place to start is Ike’s Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, named for a chef in Ricker’s Portland kitchen, which are so popular they’ve earned their own separate annex, on the Lower East Side. They’re best ordered spicy, with plenty of beer and rice to temper their sweet, sticky heat. Pok Pok’s excellent version of <em>som tam</em>, the traditional Thai tangle of shredded green papaya, dried shrimp, peanuts, and tomatoes, seasoned with lime and chiles, makes an ideal accompaniment. Moving down the menu, it’s hard to go wrong. Standouts include a bowl of stewed mustard greens and pork ribs in a smoky tamarind broth; a dish of pork belly and neck in an almost mole-like Burmese curry, studded with long beans; and a “one-plate meal” of buttery turmeric-marinated catfish medallions, pan-fried and served over vermicelli with peanuts, dill, and <em>mam nem</em>, a fermented anchovy sauce, a dish so satisfyingly complete you could eat it every day. </p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">It would be easy to leave Pok Pok Ny without ordering dessert; sugar is a key element in the complex flavor profile of Southeast Asian cuisine, and, by the end of the meal, you may have had your fill. But the Pok Pok Affogato—tiny scoops of rich, creamy condensed-milk ice cream floating in black Vietnamese coffee, served with the type of crispy Chinese crullers usually eaten with congee for breakfast—is nothing short of heavenly, and it’s hard to imagine anything more simply delicious than sticky rice and mango drenched in salted coconut cream. A sweet finish to an exhausting game, and everyone’s a winner. (Open daily for dinner. Dishes $8.50-$20.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/18/alison-eighteen	Alison Eighteen	15 W. 18th St. 	29.8017351	-95.429355	212-366-1818	2012/06/18	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="76" word_count="76">It’s not a great sign when your waiter’s response to the question “What’s in the braised rabbit?” is a harried “some spices.” Particularly when he’s already shared the news of his trip to Schenectady to catch a Moody Blues concert, discussed Ford Madox Ford, and remarked that your wine, a crisp, well-priced Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire Valley, is “good juice.” You would think he’d have time to squeeze in “oregano.”</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">Like the service, the food at Alison Price Becker’s new Flatiron restaurant is uneven but friendly. The emphasis is on classic bistro fare—roast chicken, seared scallops, grilled sirloin—with a de-rigueur locavore bent. Price Becker’s last Manhattan venture was the critically acclaimed Alison on Dominick, in SoHo. (It opened in 1989, and closed after 9/11.) If her new menu feels familiar, it may be because the chef, Robert Gurvich, ran that kitchen, too. Their straightforward formula clearly still works. The red-runner-lined tables in the high-ceilinged room—whose décor one design snob summed up as “West Elm with whimsical wallpaper”—bustles with a combination of expense-account diners and polished locals whose median age suggests that they may have been Alison regulars the last time around. </p><p data-wc="76" word_count="76">The appetizers here are a strong suit. On a recent Monday, they included a velvety mussel velouté with grace notes of saffron. A basic endive-frisée-and-watercress salad was enlivened by the sour-sweet kick of Banyuls vinegar, dollops of Point Reyes blue cheese, and a handful of pansies. A white crock of artisanal polenta, topped with foraged mushrooms, fava beans, and a dusting of Parmigiano Reggiano, earned a split decision: one vote for “classic,” another for “bland.” </p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">Alison Eighteen is justifiably proud of its rotisserie. (An illustration of a fellow turning a spit full of chickens appears on the menu.) The juicy lamb shoulder arrived perfectly cooked—one bite banished all memories of shoe-leather gyros. But the accompanying medley of roasted baby carrots and snow peas was a flashback to nouvelle cuisine, as was an unremarkable piece of poached halibut topped with flimsy slivers of blood orange.</p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">For dessert, skip the beignets—oily delivery systems for lemon-bright custard—and the milk-chocolate mousse dome and head straight for the fragrant comforts of franzipan cake, served with a spiced poached pear and caramel ice cream. Wash it down with what’s left of your Sauvignon Blanc as your waiter quotes a line from James Joyce: “White wine is like electricity.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $25-$43.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/04/gwynnett-st	Gwynnett St	312 Graham Ave., Brooklyn. 	40.7132918	-73.9438557513385	347-889-7002	2012/06/04	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="78" word_count="78">The whiskey’s in the bread and the almonds are in the cocktails at Gwynnett St., a contrarian establishment named for a street that no longer exists serving defiantly grownup food to Williamsburg’s skinny-jeans crowd. Where else would you find a perfectly good wagyu steak hidden underneath some watercress (talk about burying the lede!), or fiddlehead ferns, the prom queens of the farmers’ market, outmatched by giant stalks of spinach, served crunchy-raw, in a spectacular appetizer salad?</p><p data-wc="94" word_count="94">This is food that’s meant to challenge you, which is presumably why the kitchen presents it as art: the plating tends to the starkly asymmetrical, with a brushstroke of beet or some stippled rhubarb dust around the edge. But this isn’t molecular gastronomy (although the chef, Justin Hilbert, used to work at WD-50), and you won’t walk away hungry, not least because of that whiskey bread: springy, slightly sour, and moist like banana bread without the bananas, served with cultured Vermont butter melted to the point where no knife is required.</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">The five-dollar loaf has become so popular that the servers provide it on more of an opt-out basis. You shouldn’t. Nor should you skip the cocktails. The Rye Tai—the one with the almond syrup—is a bizarre hybrid, made with rum, of course, but also apricots. It’s as refreshing as its tropical antecedent, though thankfully less sweet. There are more surprises to come: a maitake mushroom comes to the table dripping with what you might think is melted cheese but is actually lardo. This turns out to be a good thing, because the salted pork fat brings out the delicate umami flavor of the mushroom even better than a blanket of cheese could. It has lately become necessary for all ambitious restaurants to serve an egg appetizer; here, it’s slow poached, with the egg floating in an especially fragrant broth of braised pork and Pecorino with green peas and celtuce, a Chinese lettuce. </p><p data-wc="181" word_count="181">Also delightfully aromatic is the Amish chicken, served on “burnt hay,” which smokes up at the table and tastes like a brisk walk through the woods. The salmon comes with a fragrant oyster cream, and the miniature cabbage leaves accompanying it resemble oyster shells. This being Willamsburg, the server is quick to point out that there is an entrée with tofu and a dessert without gluten. But whereas the tofu is the least successful dish of the night (the chicory that comes with it tastes unfortunately like muddy peanut butter), the gluten-free dessert is a triumph. It’s a particularly elaborate version of a meringue, which begins with birch bark steeped in sugar syrup and finishes with a powder of roasted cashews. Like much of the menu, a dessert listed as “mint, milk and green strawberries” comes with an extended explanation tableside that it does not require to be enjoyed. The “mint” part is a fluorescent-green chewy sponge cake, and although it looks like space-age packing material you’ll devour it. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/28/the-bowery-diner	The Bowery Diner	241 Bowery, between Rivington and Stanton Sts. 	null	null	null	2012/05/28	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="183" word_count="183">Remember that grilled cheese? The one you had when you were ten? It was after school, or a sporting event, and you stopped off for a bite with a grandparent, teammate, or friend from the neighborhood, and it basically changed your brain chemistry, and since then, you’ve never lost hope of stumbling upon that one delicious grilled cheese again? Well, you won’t find it at the Bowery Diner, a new venture from Motorino’s Mathieu Palombino, next door to the New Museum. The diner’s décor screams nostalgia, with its Formica tabletops and vinyl booths, but Palombino, who is Belgian, has grander ambitions. He seems to be more interested in occupying the conceptual space vacated by Florent, the former meatpacking-district institution that was half diner, half glamorous brasserie. His grilled cheese has a Continental touch (Swiss and Cheddar, layered between wide slabs of buttery grilled farm bread) and demands to be pulled apart and eaten open-faced, like a cheesy bruschetta. It’s good, in an indulgent way, until you realize how much bread, butter, and cheese you’ve just eaten. </p><p data-wc="170" word_count="170">Though it doesn’t always succeed at either, Bowery Diner’s menu aspires to satisfy adult cravings as well as childhood ones. The tuna tartare tastes, disappointingly, like the mushy insides of a spicy-tuna roll; the main draw of the smoked-salmon appetizer plate is the reappearance of that buttery grilled bread; mussels come in a shallow serving dish that skimps on juice. The menu also includes plenty of randomness. It’s part of a strategy, a waitress explained, of floating new dishes as specials, and keeping them, or not, based on their success. The salty, thoroughly average fried chicken, which comes with a caramelized-apple pancake, has apparently made the cut. So, inexplicably, has the lobster roll, which consists of a dry bun and minced, mayonnaise-drenched meat. On a recent Thursday night, around 10 <small>P</small>.<small>M</small>., an informal survey of the patrons revealed the secret to the Bowery Diner—you need to be drunk to enjoy this food. Soaking up alcohol: one of the eternal, if less noble, purposes of diner cuisine.</p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">A night at the Bowery Diner can be troublesome, forcing you to question your most cherished childhood diner memories. Was the food even that good to begin with? Take solace in the creamy milkshakes, which, despite their unconventional ingredients (peanut butter, maple syrup, optional shots of alcohol), are served in the traditional, time-honored fashion: in a small glass, with whipped cream and a cherry on top, and the extra in a shiny metal cup. While not exactly diet food, those shakes are the one bright spot on the menu, and keep alive the elusive diner dream. (Open 24 hours. Entrées $14-$18.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/21/atera	Atera	77 Worth St. 	41.7017888056676	-71.3812988847061	212-226-1444	2012/05/21	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="145" word_count="145">New York has seen cupcake and fried-chicken fads, but the city’s current food idol is the ramp, a limp and unassuming wild onion harvested in early spring. Ramps are featured in several dishes at the forager chef Matthew Lightner’s Atera, in Tribeca. Lightner is a Portland import, by way of the world-famous kitchens of Noma, in Denmark, and Mugaritz, in northern Spain. Like Mugaritz, this restaurant takes its name from the Basque: the word <em>atera</em> means “to go out,” which suits its wild-food ethos. Lightner and a full-time forager provide Atera with wintergreen, nettles, other plants, and fungi, mainly from upstate New York, and one wall of its dining room has been transformed into a vertical herb garden, overflowing with aromatics like camphor, lavender, and mint. When a curious guest asked about the wall one evening, his server coyly replied, “It’s alive.”</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">He’s right, in more ways than one. The intimate dining room vibrates with life and warmth, from the friendly service to the hand-thrown ceramic dishes. Diners fearing an experience akin to a “Portlandia” sketch will be pleasantly surprised. Lightner has a fondness for things found on forest floors, but his technical skill is what defines the food, which is showcased up front in a series of amuses inspired by the flavors and textures of snacks: crunchy, salty, sticky, chewy. Thin crackers of savory granola dipped in frozen black sesame butter melt on the tongue into a satisfying grit, and a miniature lobster roll comes on a tiny yeast-flavored meringue. A pickled quail egg is literally too good to be true (it’s a trick egg, made of aïoli bound in a milk skin), as are wholly edible razor clams (the “shells” are formed from baguette dough). </p><p data-wc="204" word_count="204">Lightner continues to dazzle with a dozen or so main courses on a set tasting menu. Among them is a forager’s breakfast parfait: a dollop of sheep’s-milk yogurt topped with a disk of frozen crystallized beet, with nuts, freeze-dried pear, jasmine petals, and chamomile. Continuing the theme of found food, a soft-shell crab is presented as an edible beach treasure, surrounded by amaranth grains for sand and brown-butter sauce for seawater. The first of several playful desserts is a “rock,” complete with a dusting of what looks like green moss. It has the texture of a slightly melted Cadbury Creme Egg, with a shell made of crumbled cookies instead of chocolate and filled with refreshing lemon-bergamot sorbet instead of oozing sugar. Lightner isn’t just playing with his food; there is a method to his modernism. He prioritizes flavor over flair without sacrificing either, sourcing basic and familiar tastes from nature. Even the ramp craze is a tale as old as time: Rapunzel was named for the plant <em>Campanula rapunculus,</em> or <em>Rapunzel</em> in German, after her mother plucked the onions from the witch’s garden to satisfy her pregnancy cravings. So go on; go out. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner. Prix-fixe $150.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/14/thirstbaravin	ThirstbaràVin	629 Classon Ave., Brooklyn 	40.6791407	-73.9583915	718-857-9227	2012/05/14	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="164" word_count="164">Scientists have suggested that food tastes better when you have to work for it. In an experiment at Johns Hopkins, in 2010, mice were confronted with two levers, one that dispensed a treat after being pressed only once, another that required fifteen presses before it released a similar snack. When they were later given equal access to both treats, the mice chose the one they had exerted themselves for. Might this principle be applied to certain New York restaurants? Is the food at the pizzeria with the line around the block really that good, or does the effort of the ninety-minute wait enhance its flavor? At the moment, eating at the restaurant and wine bar Thirstbaràvin involves no work at all. Thanks to its unfortunate location, on a bleak corner between neighborhoods, there is no wait for a table, no tense negotiation with the hostess. It seems safe to say that the food—expertly executed, unfussy, French—is delicious entirely on its own merits.</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">Add in a guarantee of fast, attentive service in an empty, beautifully minimalist dining room, and the place becomes an anti-destination destination. The proprietors, who also own Thirst, a wine store in Fort Greene, have modelled Thirstbaràvin (“Thirst bar à vin”) after the natural-wine bars of Paris, and the chalkboard wall behind the long cork bar advertises an all-organic, additive-free selection. A glass of barely pink, almost sparkling Provençal rosé pairs perfectly with a bowl of earthy, al-dente lentils, tossed with smoky lardons and chopped scallions, and crowned with half of a medium-boiled, golden-yolked egg. Slightly chilled, rough-hewn pork pâté, spread with spicy mustard on crusty brown bread and washed down with musky Melon de Bourgogne, conjures visions of a farm in France.</p><p data-wc="178" word_count="178">The entrées, too, evoke the countryside: chicken and sautéed shallots with a simple salad; pork-and-sage <em>caillettes</em> (somewhere between meatballs and sausages), fragrant and juicy atop creamy mashed potatoes. The best of an array of excellent desserts are the rich, buoyant chocolate mousse and a golden-crusted almond cake, each topped with a generous dollop of dense whipped cream. For coffee, there is a retro-looking Kees van der Westen espresso machine, as sleek and sexy as a motorcycle, and a bartender with plenty of time to make and remake shots, unprompted, for finicky bean snobs. Spilling out of Thirstbaràvin and onto the street, into view of the gas station up the block, is a bit cognitively dissonant—Paris this is not—but there’s something almost charming about the stray cats slipping in and out of the overgrown lot next door. And, with the time saved from not waiting, you may even be able to make it to a movie at the nearest theatre—a half-hour stroll away. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/07/littleneck	Littleneck	288 Third Ave., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2012/05/07	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="141" word_count="141">A clam shack by the Gowanus Canal? It sounds like the setup for a joke, as God only knows what freakish mollusks lurk in that fetid post-industrial waterway. Never fear: Littleneck sources its seafood from more pellucid waters up and down the New England coast, and is a full block away from the canal, in a gritty, rapidly developing area where live-music spots and an artisanal pie shop stand beside warehouses and a forbidding old-time social club. Opened by a couple of former rock musicians, the enterprise is almost a compendium of the Zeitgeist: furnishings are made from salvaged materials, nightly specials are tweeted, and capital was raised on Kickstarter. In their fund-raising video, the owners hang out near the canal. “You know what goes great with clams?” says one. “Beer.” His colleague: “You know what goes great with beer? Clams.”</p><p data-wc="164" word_count="164">With its white wainscoting and nautical paraphernalia, the room affects the look of some old dockside haunt. The menu follows suit, and is comprised mostly of no-fuss classics like fried oysters, skate wing, and steamers. The lobster rolls and clam rolls, made with nostalgia-tinged Sunbeam bread, are piled high with fish. There’s an unpretentious raw bar, craft beers, a small but well-chosen wine list. The predictable is leavened with notes of idiosyncrasy: a pea-shoot-and-watermelon-radish salad provides just the right edge of tartness to the greasier offerings, as does a beautifully balanced pickle garnish—sweet with a little chile—that accompanies several dishes. If there’s a criticism to be made, it’s that the aggressive flavors of the more ambitious options can obscure what’s underneath. A piece of flash-marinated mackerel was no match for the surrounding kimchi and pepper paste. A bowl of mussels, while enjoyable, was dominated by a heavily salted, Thai-accented sauce of coconut, ginger, and a lot of garlic.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">These bold choices might betray some insecurity about letting fine ingredients speak for themselves. But maybe the restaurateurs simply know their clientele. Most nights, the place is thronged by a local-seeming hipster crowd. The staff have a hard time keeping up with the success, but they are friendly and motivated, with a likable informality that defines the dining experience. On a recent night, a waitress speeding across the room stopped just long enough to point out the beauty of some barnacles on the underside of an oyster shell.

The palate-dazzling newcomer is the eighth restaurant lining the short Village block that also boasts Po (Mario Batali’s first venture) and Pearl Oyster Bar (the lobster-roll-craze pioneer). Not that the Malaysian-born chef Simpson Wong is a Johnny-come-lately. His charming Café Asean has been a neighborhood standby for first dates and takeout since 1996, and his higher-end, highly praised Jefferson was so buzz-worthy it hosted a wedding reception on “Sex and the City,” before closing, in 2005.</p><p data-wc="159" word_count="159">Wong’s space is simple: three rows of tables, a counter open to the kitchen, and a handful of seats at the bar. (Avoid the table for two at the end of it, which is plopped like an afterthought next to the door.) When the restaurant is full, which is usually, the room can get noisy, but it’s unlikely that conversation will be your top priority once the plates start arriving. From the first bite of the pungent paratha, served, in lieu of bread, with a curry-rich dipping sauce, the food’s complex flavors may reduce the most talkative diners to monosyllabic expressions of bliss. When one quick-witted guest tucked into her cast-iron skillet of lobster egg foo young—a succulent concoction of poached tail and claw, leeks, and half-cooked yolks with tomatoes and chiles—she declared, “It’s the gourmet answer to hangover food” before trailing off into a mumble, “I, I, I . . . it’s so good.”</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">Wong bills itself as the city’s first locavore Asian establishment, and its farm-to-table approach means the menu is constantly changing. A coriander-sauced Finger Lake rib eye one visit might be replaced by a Berkshire pork chop with pineapple-laced Brussels sprouts the next. But a handful of specialties make the cut every night: tender scallops with crisp duck-tongue meatballs no bigger than marbles; pork belly with “tater tots” made of taro; savory rice noodles and hake with the drag-queen-like moniker Cha Ca La Wong. With two days’ notice, you can have the seven-course “duckavore” dinner, but even last-minute types can indulge in the single best thing on the menu: roast-duck ice cream, so salty-sweet it puts caramel to shame, paired with star-anise-poached plums. If you’re lucky, skeptics will scoff at the fowl-based confection and you won’t have to share it. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $16-$35.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

At North End Grill, in Battery Park City, what is normally the most boring item on a menu—mixed greens—is transformed with an aggressive lime-and-mango-pickle number that begs to be bottled and sold at Whole Foods. To infuse the most pedestrian of vegetables with such unmistakable flavor is a trademark of Floyd Cardoz, formerly of the universally beloved Indian restaurant Tabla, which has closed. Like Tabla, North End Grill is a Danny Meyer production, which becomes obvious on entry, when the host reflexively compliments an item of your clothing while leading you to your table. Meyer and Cardoz have created a temple of calm for captains of industry—which is to say, people who work in the nearby office towers of the financial district—with a shiny marble bar, discreet booths ripe for deal-striking, and a preternaturally quiet open kitchen. </p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">With its telltale proteins section—you can order an eighty-eight-dollar rib eye for two, sides not included—the menu seems specifically designed for expense accounts. That would explain the extensive Scotch selection, though not the misguided Scotch-based cocktails. Best to stick with Tabla’s signature drinks, carried over here: the famous tamarind margarita and the “kachumber cooler,” a gin-and-cucumber drink. On a menu of new American standards, Cardoz allows himself one moment of whimsy: a puzzling selection of dinnertime egg dishes. “Chef thinks eggs are not used enough in the evening,” a waiter explained in a slightly rote way. None of the egg dishes would look out of place at an East Village hangover brunch—scrambled with mushrooms and grilled bread, coddled with grits—but perhaps there’s a reason eggs are not normally regarded as a dinner delicacy. They’re monotonous in both flavor and texture, and too filling, even in appetizer portions.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">As wrong as it seems to devour an entire bowl of thrice-fried spiced fries mere steps from the Irish potato-famine memorial, the success of this simple dish is a reminder that North End Grill is all about the classics, executed with flair. Desserts fit with the theme: oldies but goodies. A butterscotch pot de crème comes recommended by multiple servers as their favorite. Its real delight is hidden; the whole table dives, as if for sunken treasure, through the depths of pudding in search of the whiskey-soaked marshmallows buried at the bottom. It’s a final, gentle reminder from the chef that all work and no play makes for a dull dinner indeed. (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

Inside, however, there is no mistaking skate wing for catfish; everyone—staff included—is likely better coiffed and better dressed than you, and that neon sign happens to be part of an installation by the downtown artist Hanna Liden. Think of Acme as the trendy younger sibling of Indochine, the clubby home of the art and fashion crowds since the eighties. It’s no coincidence that the two places have a similar scene—they share owners—nor was it by chance that Acme opened in time for New York Fashion Week.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">Unlike Indochine, this hot spot is determined to be known for its food. The owners hired Mads Refslund, a Danish chef most famous for his association with René Redzepi as a co-founder of Noma, in Copenhagen. The two were friends from culinary school, but could not make their kitchen marriage work; Refslund soon left to open his own place, and Redzepi’s Noma soared to the top of everyone’s best-restaurant list. Early publicity has labelled Acme’s food Scandinavian, but there is little on the menu to support that notion besides a dessert of Danish doughnuts, the traditional spherical pancakes known as <em>æbleskiver</em>. Smaller plates are listed under new-Nordic buzzwords—raw, cooked, soil—but the entrées run high bistro: lobster, rib eye, pork chop. </p><p data-wc="218" word_count="218">One gets the sense that most of the clientele wouldn’t know what to do with the Duck in a Jar, tender chunks of duck confit among tart, pickled vegetables, except fiddle with the latch top. A dish of sweet shrimp-and-bison tartare with bitter lettuce and white walnuts, while pleasantly tender and refreshingly lean, was nearly knocked off its pedestal by an excess of oil. Foam makes a few casual appearances: roasted sunflower seed over an avant-garde stew of nutty pearl barley, clams, and scallops, and winter truffle and Gruyère atop knobby, blackened sunchokes, the coolest new kids on the tuber block. Black heirloom carrots, each delicately blanketed in a thin sheet of salted lardo, were undercooked and crisp, but their savory flavor was cut cleanly by blood orange. The same went for salt-baked beets: too tough, but beautifully balanced by tart red grapefruit and aged vinegar. Refslund’s best work arrives last, and late (getting to dessert can take up to three hours): wafer-thin chocolate crisps glued together with ganache and coffee ice cream, and dried pears over lush green wheatgrass granité.

Picture Manhattan’s self-satisfied organ-meat enthusiasts obliviously dining on the flanks and kidneys of their Brooklyn counterparts—Bushwick jerky, Greenpoint terrine. Talk about your locavores. But, no, the name is actually an homage to the legendary Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx, and also a sidelong way for the owner, Christian Pappanicholas, a cycling fanatic who owns Resto, the Belgian restaurant next door, to summon the spirit of the hard-core carnivore. </p><p data-wc="284" word_count="284">The Cannibal is three things at once. It is an artisanal butcher shop, with meat supplied by the West Village purveyor Pat LaFrieda. It is a beer store; refrigerators by the entrance are stocked with hundreds of brands, most of them obscure, with funky labels that make trophies of empties. Finally, it is a snug and rustic barroom, where you can partake of all that beer and meat. You sit on stools at the bar, or else stand in what little space is left (there’s a beer garden out back in warmer months). The walls are lined with local dry and canned goods—Bobby Sue’s Nuts, Sour Puss Pickles, Sweet Deliverance jam, Finish Line Ceramic Wet Lube (for bicycle gears)—and, on the bar, there are jars of cookies and little wooden bowls of uncracked filberts and almonds. The nuts are pretty much the last good fats you’ll see, once the plates and cutting boards start to show. And they come in no particular order. One does wonder whether it is proper to have the veal tartare before or after the braised pork belly. When should the civilized man eat his pork rinds: prior to the pair of hot dogs smothered in beef-heart chili, or after the dogs, as a palette cleanser, in preparation for the slow-roasted half pig’s head? Emily Post is unclear on the matter. Recently, a patron, after a lunch consisting of bone marrow and a pig’s-head Cuban sandwich, decided on a dessert of blood sausage with diced onions and apples. It was, like the meal before it, excellent, but all of it, what with the pints of high-octane pale ale, made for a gouty afternoon. </p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">To call the menu “bare bones” wouldn’t be fair to Michael Berardino, the chef (or “meat head”), whose ways with slain beasts are not totally unmediated. The barest bone is the wrench of marrow, roasted and salted, and it comes dressed with parsley, lemon, and radish. The pork-liver terrine, a wedge the size of a cassette, wears a dollop of fennel marmalade. The hot dogs come with mustard. And, in all fairness, you can have a salad. The one of escarole, sunchokes, anchovies, and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms does not lack heft. Pair it with a Westmalle Trappist Tripel, from Belgium, and you’ll be all lubed up for a sprint to the top of Mont Ventoux. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/02/talde	Talde	369 Seventh Ave., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2012/04/02	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="134" word_count="134">Ten years ago, the cooking of the Filipino-American chef Dale Talde might have been categorized as Asian fusion, a designation that today holds all the appeal of a frozen stir-fry dinner. In 2012, Talde—standing, perhaps, on David Chang’s shoulders—has given his Park Slope restaurant the more modern-sounding label of “Asian-American,” which is also the ubiquitous adjective for the new New York Knick Jeremy Lin (a Californian of Taiwanese origin), who, for a while, seemed to be pumping air into a deflated franchise. Talde was a popular “Top Chef” contestant, and fans were waiting two hours for tables weeks before anyone uttered the word “Linsanity.” It’s clear, though, that the chef takes pride in the athlete’s rise—wear Lin’s jersey, get a free cocktail—and, moreover, in their shared identity. </p><p data-wc="170" word_count="170">In decorating, Talde may have gone a little overboard—it’s as though someone ran wild at a restaurant-supply store in Flushing, amassing enough mahogany Orientalist reliefs and faux-jade dragon sculptures to far surpass any intended irony. The menu, however, is much subtler, offering playful, family-style food, inspired by a variety of Asian cuisines, and, more often than not, quite good. Pretzel pork-and-chive dumplings taste like the love child of a Hong Kong hawker stall and a New York hot-dog cart: salty, blistered, and stuffed with juicy pink pork, they’re served with the kind of spicy mustard that comes with Chinese takeout and is too often relegated to the kitchen junk drawer. Kale—the overexposed vegetable of the moment—is given new life in a salad with squash and apple, dressed in miso-ponzu and panko. Order the luscious lobster <em>tom kha gai</em> (Thai coconut-milk soup) with a side of rich, thick-cut black-pepper-butter toast and you may have to be carried out of the restaurant before the entrées arrive. </p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">That would be a shame: impossibly crispy Korean fried chicken comes with green-grape halves and a kimchee yogurt sauce so addictive that, one night, when a busser tried to clear a plate that had only a few swipes of it left, an entire table chorused “No!” The slightly cloying, plummy oyster-and-bacon pad thai elicited the opposite response, as did Filipino short ribs <em>kare-kare</em>, which, though well flavored with coconut, peanuts, and pickled chiles, were almost chalky in texture. But the whole branzino, roasted with tomato and turmeric in a banana leaf, was as succulent as silken tofu, and perfect wrapped in warm moo-shu pancakes. It may seem surprising that a restaurant that doesn’t exactly shy away from excess offers only one dessert, but, then, that dessert is a heaping bowl of <em>halo-halo</em>, traditionally made with shaved ice, condensed milk, and a hodgepodge of Filipino fruits and sweets. Talde’s, featuring charred banana, tapioca pearls, and Cap’n Crunch, could be the Asian-American answer to apple pie. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $15-$26.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/26/caffe-storico	Caffè Storico	170 Central Park W., at 77th St. 	null	null	null	2012/03/26	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="152" word_count="152">A serious restaurant in a museum: what a good concept. Pioneered by <small>MOMA</small>, with the Modern, and spreading, with varying degrees of success, to the Whitney (Untitled), the Guggenheim (the Wright), and the Museum of Arts and Design (Robert), the formula, if executed well, can create a sum that is greater than its parts. An afternoon spent looking at Klimts at the Neue Galerie sounds much better if it includes a strudel at Café Sabarsky. At Caffè Storico, the restaurant in the newly renovated New-York Historical Society, you can combine your love of nineteenth-century historical documents with fine Italian dining. What do the two have in common? Not much—which is probably a wise choice. A menu more historically accurate to New York, according to William Grimes, in “Appetite City: A Culinary History of New York,” would have included “sinkers” (grilled biscuits sitting in a pool of butter), pickled oysters, and beef-and-beans.</p><p data-wc="239" word_count="239">The main nod to thematic affinity at Caffè Storico, besides the name (a press release helpfully points out that <em>storico</em> is “Italian for ‘historic’ “), is the décor. The walls are lined with fifteen-foot-high white shelves with Victorian-style woodwork, displaying nineteenth-century china from the museum’s collection. The effect is lovely, like a cross between a mausoleum and a butler’s pantry, but, fortunately, with none of the stuffiness of those places. On a recent Saturday night, when the Upper West Side yuppie contingent made up a majority of the patrons, there were strollers parked beside the white marble tables, and a waitress cheerfully accommodated a party that wanted to crowd in extra seats. The three-part menu starts with <em>cicchetti</em> (tapas-like plates served in Venetian bars) and moves on to primi and secondi. The low-key <em>cicchetti</em> include a chunky, satisfying chicken liver on crostini; sweet scallops in a white-wine reduction; a dollop of burrata, with artichoke heart; and a salty rabbit porchetta. They’re perfectly fine, these little dishes, but, as you work your way through them, the downside of museum dining begins to sink in: they’re not cheap, and despite the waitstaff’s insistence that you can survive on <em>cicchetti</em> and pasta alone—standouts include the gnocchi, in a creamy truffle fonduta, and the ricotta cavatelli, with lobster and black-trumpet mushrooms—if you eat like a twenty-first-century American you’ll likely want to progress to round three.</p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">The osso bucco, while tasty, is just osso bucco, and the salmon, while buttery and comforting, is just salmon. The slow-roasted chicken, tender and moist, is apparently one of the chef Jim Burke’s specialties. For dessert, the chocolate budino, or, even better, the apple crostata, should go well with your heated discussion about the Stamp Act, the original copy of which currently resides only a few feet away.

In the late seventies, you could watch Andy Kaufman wrestle a woman for fifty dollars. Following a fit of reinvention in the late aughts, Kutsher’s became home to All Tomorrow’s Parties, an indie-music festival featuring acts like the Flaming Lips, but the sleepaway-camp vibe didn’t appeal to enough hipsters to make it profitable. Now Zach Kutsher, fourth-generation resort royalty, has assembled a group of investors including Jeffrey Chodorow—a co-owner of aggressively themed restaurants such as China Grill—to open a Manhattan outpost. In his attempt to straddle the past and the present, Kutsher conjures memories of poolside cha-cha lessons, pass-the-medicine-ball, and Milton Berle while fully realizing a restaurateur’s vision of modern-day Tribeca capitalism that lands just short of kitsch.</p><p data-wc="236" word_count="236">At Kutsher’s upstate, for Passover 2012, you’ll find entertainment by Uncle Moishe, a singles program with Sharon Ganz, and “the most affordable Glatt Kosher Full Service Resort program on the East Coast.” At Kutsher’s Tribeca, you’ll find geometrically arranged sixties-esque blond-wood slats, trapezoidal lighting fixtures, and a menu that embellishes traditional Eastern European Jewish classics, with prices to match (and, presumably, to fit into the neighborhood, where a family breakfast at Bubby’s can easily run to a hundred dollars). Authentic kosher it’s not, but the chef, Mark Spangenthal, has deftly crafted a menu full of comfort foods—and rife with key words like schmalz, borscht, and Fox’s U-Bet—that are accomplished and delicious. Fried artichokes Alla Judea (alla Rome’s Trastevere district) are addictive, dusted with lightly fried parsley and Parmesan. The oft-dreaded gefilte fish turns up as a super-fresh disk of wild halibut chunks, dressed elegantly with beet and horseradish tartare, tiny arugula leaves, and parsley vinaigrette. Potato pancakes, perfectly crisped on the outside, are also slightly crunchy on the inside, making for an extra-chewy treat (sour cream and topnotch homemade applesauce helped appease a table of eager diners). Well-executed entrées include a mild, creamy ricotta-stuffed kreplach (“like Jewish ravioli,” a server explained) and perfectly rare duck breast. Flanken, popular in the early twentieth century for its low-price-to-high-flavor ratio, is reimagined as meltingly tender red-wine-braised “flanken-style” short ribs.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Kutsher’s does not disappoint when it comes to charcuterie; selections of fish (silky salmon pastrami, Nova, and sable) and deli meats (expertly house-smoked beef and duck pastramis, veal tongue) rival the best in the city. For brunch, avoid the knishes, redolent of the refrigerator, and stick with eggs, smoked fish, and a homemade celery soda or a freshly mashed cherry-lime rickey. As they used to say in the Borscht Belt, It’s on the menu: you eat. (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/12/rouge-et-blanc	Rouge Et Blanc	48 MacDougal St. 	40.7273101	-74.0025924	212-260-5757	2012/03/12	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="161" word_count="161">The décor at this seductive French-Vietnamese bistro—antique Chinese screen panels, red wooden chairs, rattan-matted walls, bas-reliefs of pagodas—conjures up a bordello somewhere in interwar Indochina. A French zinc bar sits near the front, and, in the dining room at back, there are several romantic nooks. A nice feeling for the charms of wear and tear—a couple of damp patches may or may not be part of the design—saves things from getting too precious. Even though there isn’t an old gramophone horn emitting crackly jazz in the corner, it feels as if there could be. The owner is Thomas Cregan, formerly a sommelier at Chanterelle, which accounts for the excellent wine list and, presumably, the name of the place. The chef, Matt Rojas, is neither French nor Vietnamese, but his previous work, at Degustation and Eleven Madison Park, has paved the way for an imaginative approach and an expertise in packing delicate morsels with many calories.</p><p data-wc="197" word_count="197">The menu offers lots of small plates and a few larger ones; preparation is imaginative, and presentation often exquisite. A mildly spiced Vietnamese sausage is loosely formed around a licorice-root stick, like an upscale corn dog. Octopus tentacles are braised and pressed together, then sliced, like deli meat, into a mosaic of cross-sections. Rojas has a thing for pairing cephalopods and beasts of the field: squid mantles are stuffed with tangy short rib; crisped baby octopus sits on the marrow of a laterally bisected bone. Even plainer-looking dishes exhibit well-balanced flavors. A mound of julienned papaya, served with fried shrimp and curry vinaigrette, is like a bonsai green curry—a wealth of flavors articulated in just a little space. The star of the show is a whole rouget, served dorsal fin upward as if the fish were still swimming. The skin is fried to a crisp, but the flesh beneath remains delicate, and the accompanying <em>nuoc mam</em> sauce vibrates with the tang of sweet basil, chili, and cilantro. A Sunday-brunch menu includes a formidable banh-mi sandwich, filled with a strip of deliquescent, almost sweet pork belly, lathered in soft pâté and offset by pink vinegared onions.</p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">The place is often on the quiet side, and, while it deserves more acclaim, there is an appeal to the current state of casual conviviality. Some guests are evidently friends from other restaurants or otherwise connected to food. On a recent evening, a stylish group—pomade, pocket squares—hovered at the bar consuming soju cocktails and discussing a forthcoming Joe Bastianich TV appearance. It is, to paraphrase Milton, a fit audience though few. After the short ribs and the banh mi, perhaps not that fit, either. (Open daily for dinner and Sundays for brunch.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/05/battersby	Battersby	255 Smith St., Brooklyn 	40.6831231	-73.9927719	718-852-8321	2012/03/05	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="173" word_count="173">At Smith Street’s newest restaurant, standards are so high that even the napkins are not exempt. “That was a very poor fast fold, and I apologize,” said a waitress on a recent evening of her efforts to tidy a table between courses. Battersby sounds like an appropriately British name for a place with such decorous service, but, in fact, it refers to the street in Philadelphia on which Joseph Ogrodnek, a chef and co-owner, formerly of Gramercy Tavern, grew up. Walker Stern, the other chef and co-owner, has cooked at Blue Hill and most recently at the Vanderbilt, another of the new breed of refined Brooklyn restaurants fancy enough to feel like Manhattan. But where the Vanderbilt is known for its small plates, the sophisticated, intimate Battersby serves deliberately paced, elaborately conceived four-course meals. It’s an old-fashioned idea, but the eclectic food is anything but, starting with an amuse-bouche that changes daily but always delights: a Greek-yogurt mousse with vegetable muesli one day, a luxurious schmear of chicken-liver mousse the next.</p><p data-wc="246" word_count="246">For tables of young Brooklynites and their supportive parents taking them out for dinner (overheard: “I don’t want to be one of those fathers who doesn’t let you pursue what you love”), Ogrodnek and Stern are producing some of the borough’s most accomplished and exciting food. There are beautiful salads to start, one made with Castelfranco, a rare white radicchio with delicate pink stripes that looks like an orchid; a crowd-pleasing dinosaur-kale dish, prepared two ways and served with a tangy, Thai-basil-infused fish sauce and kohlrabi; and a slow-burn kimchi, which offers up such depth of flavor that it tastes almost like braised meat. More complex dishes are just as consistent. Veal sweetbreads bob alongside romaine-lettuce boats in a briny Caesar dressing, while a more classic combination of octopus and chickpeas, sometimes mushy together, retains the texture of both ingredients. Triggerfish with an aromatic vegetable broth sounds horrible, like something consumed on a detox diet, but a waiter assures the group it’s his “ex-favorite” dish on the menu, and, sure enough, it turns out to be rich and velvety, the hit of the night. His current pick, the buttery polenta soup, is redolent of sweet Maine shrimp. On every table, there is a dish of puréed potatoes, already Yelp-famous, which taste like a delicious cloud of cream. Slow-roasted oxtail is a bold garnish, and it’s a testament to the humblest of starches that you almost forget the meat is there.</p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">In lieu of another round of puréed potatoes for dessert, there’s a boozy olive-oil cake, and a dreamy fennel panna cotta, salty and sweet in the right measure, served with a single frond of the vegetable on top and little strands throughout. To turn out anything beyond buffalo wings in a space this small is remarkable; that the food is this good makes it all the more so. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

Say what you will about skinny jeans, but the home of the hipster has some of the most exciting new restaurants in New York. At Isa, Taavo Somer (the restaurateur and scene-maker behind Freemans and Peels) has taken a highly personal approach to the space, and, like a teen-ager’s bedroom, it deliberately resists being understood. Some days, the menu is a kooky graphic collage, and until recently the bathroom was a neon-fluorescent hall of triangular mirrors. (Perhaps in response to quizzical attention, it has been toned down.) Geometric forms abound, the furniture looks vaguely Scandinavian—woodsy yet sleek—and the over-all feeling is that of a hippie ski cabin. In one corner, a small succulent potted in a green ceramic mug with an ear for a handle features a button that asks, “Why be normal?”</p><p data-wc="206" word_count="206">The food is anything but rustic. The menu lists components only—no sources or even methods of preparation—with the result that expectations are muted. One night, artistically arranged starters of “beet, apple, granola, foie gras” and “tartare, sunchoke, flax soil, crème fraîche” looked ultra-modern, on large, flat plates, as if they had been nicked from a haute-cuisine kitchen. A dish called “calamari, ink, pil pil, dill” elicited another kind of surprise, arriving as a whole squid, completely intact; the flesh was startlingly tender and the ink satisfyingly briny. There are less challenging options: “ham,” “cheese,” and “wings in sticky caramel,” the last being easy to understand and even easier to eat, if a couple of notches too sweet. There are generally only two or three entrées on offer; one night they were duck breast, mackerel, and porridge. “Porridge? For dinner?” a woman asked, of no one in particular. The savory concoction came piping hot, studded with walnuts, radicchio di Treviso, and sharp, salty Gorgonzola; not a spoonful was spared. The mackerel, paired with carrots, yogurt, and egg yolk, could have used more acid but was cooked to perfection. Slivers of rich duck breast and liver were balanced by celeriac and dandelion greens.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">Dessert is another juke—instead of sweets and chocolate, there are expositions on taste. Grapefruit curd with mascarpone and a crumble of pistachio and green tea demonstrated the more elegant notes of bitterness, and sunchoke cream with chestnut, black-trumpet mushrooms, and coffee expounded on the sweet-savory spectrum of nuttiness. Diners are often so disarmed by the food that they break the fourth wall to consult with their neighbors. After weighing in on a discussion of ice cubes and exchanging bites, one couple asked another, “Wait, are you having ham for dessert?” Why not? (Open daily for dinner and weekends for brunch.

The Tuscan-style Beppe was a hit for nine years, before closing in 2010. Within months, another upscale down-home establishment sprang up in its place, helmed by the rising star Shea Gallante, and it may well be serving the finest, if hardly the cheapest, Italian food in New York. Beppe’s chef used to greet guests wearing rosemary tucked into his pocket; by coincidence, small vases on Ciano’s tables sport sprigs of the herb in lieu of flowers. Think of it as the Italian four-leaf clover.</p><p data-wc="246" word_count="246">Not that Gallante needs luck. At the now defunct Cru, where he earned a Michelin star, he was so esteemed by critics that when the news broke that he was leaving, the <em>Times</em> ran the headline “<small>SAD DAY</small>.” The rustic cuisine at Ciano has been garnering well-deserved raves since it opened, and the cozy farmhouse interior (made of wood reclaimed from a bona-fide farmhouse) is packed with well-heeled locals, zealous Yelpers, and expense-account-fuelled out-of-towners. With popularity come a few problems—the wait for your table can feel interminable, and the service can be more than sloppy—but who cares if a Martini lands in your lap when the food on your plate tastes like heaven? Gallante saves the best for first: fist-size veal meatballs, so earthy they give dirt a good name, resting on silky polenta that’s lent smoky depth by truffle Pecorino. The appetizer (two to an order) is so impossibly tasty that you may be tempted to cancel the rest of your meal and binge, but man cannot live by meatball alone—not with duck-bolognese-topped pappardelle, tortellini with pumpkin in nutty brown butter, and a carnivore’s dream of a veal chop on the menu. Vegans and the gluten-averse can take solace in classic contorni—broccoli rabe with raisins and pine nuts, spinach aglio olio—and in salads like the pretty plate of rainbow beets, a still-life of fuchsia, crimson, and yellow, its sweetness offset by the peppery bite of bright-green wild watercress.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Ciano’s impressive wine cellar, the work of the ex-Cru sommelier John Slover, runs the gamut and offers an extensive list of half bottles. Frugal couples can wash down their pasta with a twenty-four-dollar <em>demi-bottiglia</em> of Valpolicella; one-per-centers can cap off their meal with a twenty-seven-hundred-dollar (full-size) Sauternes. If you prefer your dessert in a non-liquid form, try the Honeycrisp Napoleon, with its unexpected kick of spiced apple. After cleaning his plate, one diner scanned the menu for <em>digestivi</em>, then announced, with resignation, “I couldn’t put another thing in my mouth.” Defeat has never tasted so good.

In the end, Nights and Weekends, in Greenpoint, falls squarely in the former category; only at a bar does a waitress tell you, on a busy Friday night, that tables are every-man-for-himself. The most anxious of diners can recruit the waitress to give a nod when a party is leaving, try again on a Tuesday night or a Saturday morning, or head across the street to Five Leaves, which shares owners and is a definite restaurant, wait list and all. But the bar’s Latin-American theme makes the hands-off attitude seem fitting, even inviting. What’s the rush? Relax, have a margarita (the Millionaire’s, made with tequila, Hennessy, and mezcal, comes in a metal tumbler rimmed with black-lava salt), watch the vibrantly dressed crowd mingle in the triangular, concrete-and-brushed-metal space. When the weather’s warm, big windows open onto outdoor counters, and the place takes on the air of a snack bar at the beach. </p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">The food—better than any bar’s should be—is worth waiting for. “Best toast in town!” a young woman declared after sampling several varieties at brunch: crusty seven-grain topped with mashed avocado and chile flakes; crisp golden triangles painted with cinnamon butter; and a special of rum-raisin French, dolloped with <em>crema inglés</em>, banana, and macadamias. <em>Provoleta</em>, a round slab of fried cheese, makes for a savory sort of pancake, and a salad of papaya, pineapple, and mango, tossed with toasted coconut flakes and creamy goat-milk caramel, is a ticket to the tropics. After dark, there is <em>mariquitas</em> pie, a Cuban-inspired, nachos-like pile of plantain chips loaded with black beans, avocado, and <em>Cotija </em>cheese; fried shishito peppers with sour-orange rock salt and thin slices of kumquat; and a <em>chupe del día</em>, or daily stew—on a recent night, rich with pork, yucca, and potato.</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">Those who ask only booze of their watering holes will be happy to find fourteen types of rum on the menu, as well as cocktails with names like El Piloto (featuring Macchu Pisco) and the Hemingway Daiquiri (a bit weaker than the name might imply). But one shouldn’t drink on an empty stomach, and it would be a crime not to try at least the fried chicken skins, with a squirt of hot sauce, or the battered rock shrimp, crisp as popcorn and dotted with orange-chile aioli and sliced serranos. This bar’s kitchen may be small, but it’s mighty. (Open daily for dinner and weekends for brunch. Plates $7-$14.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

If the premise seems jarring—it’s a bit like that of “The Simple Life,” the 2003 reality show in which Paris Hilton went off to milk cows in rural Arkansas—the restaurant’s literal-minded décor doesn’t inspire confidence, either: instead of chandeliers, as you’d find at David Burke Townhouse, on East Sixty-first Street, the Kitchen’s basement space is decked out with a soaring, barn-like wooden ceiling, blue gingham napkins, and a wooden chopping block; on the walls are Kodachrome portraits of beaming farmers clutching live lambs, roosters, and pigs. Get it?</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">The style in Burkeville could be described as over-the-top, and how well this meshes with farm food depends on the dish. It’s fun to spoon chicken liver from a pint-size jelly jar before your meal, or to pluck mini tuna tacos, garnished with whipped avocado and lime, from a doll-size metal holding rack. But stay away from the salmon pastrami, leathery strips of fish wrapped around slightly soggy pretzel sticks. Some foods, apparently, should never assume lollipop form. The octopus is a winner—crispy on the outside, in a lemon-zesty chili sauce. One of Burke’s signature appetizers is the pretzel crab cake. A rectangle of pretzel sticks garnished with pepper marmalade and beer foam, it doesn’t look like any crab cake you’ve ever seen. It’s not bad, but the crabmeat is hard to taste beneath the crunchy, tempura-like exterior, and a pragmatic diner pronounced it “not worth the calories.” “Ants on a log,” however, was. A giant bone that looks like it was on its way to the farm dog’s dish, it contains rich marrow, earthy snails, and a surprisingly delicate splash of liquefied parsley.</p><p data-wc="175" word_count="175">There are some missteps among the entrées, too: the monkfish is presented, unappealingly, with its skin, gray and charred, and its tail poking at the side of the dish. A succulent slab of rib eye—served with nothing but a dollop of horseradish crème fraîche and a butcher’s knife—provides a welcome nod to simplicity. Though it’s not, perhaps, worth going out of your way for, David Burke Kitchen is certainly better than the average hotel restaurant, and it’s a good option if you happen to be in the area. On weekends, it’s peaceful at brunch, when sunlight streaming through the windows near the high wooden ceiling creates the pleasant sensation of being inside the hull of a ship. Order the lobster soup: dumplings served in a pungent, beet-red vegetable broth, steamed before your eyes in a glass contraption resembling a coffeepot. You’re a long way from the farm.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/23/do-or-dine	Do or Dine	1108 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn 	40.6867794	-73.9547635	718-684-2290	2012/01/23	<p data-wc="176" word_count="176">It’s not every day that you find a restaurant with both a Michelin rating and a New York City Sanitation Grade B in the window. But, then, Do or Dine, in Bed-Stuy, is odd and aggressively irreverent in almost every way, from its name, a play on the fading motto of the neighborhood (“Bed-Stuy do or die,” a rhyme made famous by Biggie Smalls and Lil’ Kim), to the décor, which includes trompe-l’oeil wood-grain wallpaper, a rotating disco ball, and a poster of a fallen Sonny Liston at the feet of a triumphant Muhammad Ali, with a dialogue bubble that reads, “David Chang is my favorite food!” Cocktails are listed under the heading “Dranks,” and one of the weirdest and most popular is a shot of whiskey served with a homemade pickle-juice chaser, which, through the magic of molecular gastronomy, has been transformed into something chemically and aesthetically very much like an egg yolk; you shoot the whiskey and then pop the slimy green sphere into your mouth, where it bursts into action.</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">The food is just as berserk, but it also happens to be mostly delicious. A starter called “E666S” consists of culantro-and-bacon-infused devilled eggs that are deep-fried and topped with red dots of sriracha, giving them the distinct appearance of small tempura breasts. “George’s Steak Tartare” comes with “Bedford Hill espresso aioli,” but the lovely lean meat, which arrives molded into the shape of a cow, doesn’t taste anything like coffee. Some of the best dishes are actually the least outlandish. The “Mac 11,” two fillets of perfectly cooked mackerel served with enoki mushrooms and slivers of parsnips and carrots in a clear, tangy broth, is a welcome spot of lightness on a menu larded with the fatty, the fried, and the foie-gras-filled. There are goose-liver doughnuts, a sumptuous lamb-breast starter, and a toothsome deep-fried Cornish game hen, named, with characteristic hipster preciousness, “A Chicken and Some Woffals.”</p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">It is pretty difficult to leave Do or Dine without feeling very full and very fat, and it would be nice if the chefs devoted any energy at all to vegetables. As it stands, the only options are a bland salad and a very tasty plate of blistered shishito peppers served with four sorts of salt: green tea, wasabi, hickory, and yuzu. But it is unlikely that health-consciousness or even a sense of balance will become a preoccupation of the proprietors anytime soon. A very friendly, profoundly competent waitress informed a table on a recent evening that one of her bosses, inspired by the return of horse slaughterhouses to this country, was eager to put pony on the menu come spring. “I feel like you’ll be serving human by summer,” a diner remarked. The waitress smiled, put a finger to her lips, and said, “Sh-h-h.” (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $16-$25.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/16/whitehall	Whitehall	19 Greenwich Ave. 	41.7062825958546	-71.4633652880635	212-675-7261	2012/01/16	<p data-wc="87" word_count="87">Until recently, the duller end of Greenwich Avenue was punctuated by an upmarket children’s restaurant, GOOP-recommended and decorated like something Marie Antoinette dreamed up. That space is now a serious gin joint, named after the central offices of the British bureaucracy, and so fittingly discreet in its signage that you may walk past it a few times before realizing it’s there. It’s a dramatic transformation, and a clear win for a neighborhood where it can feel as though Marc Jacobs stores outnumber casual-dining options.</p><p data-wc="179" word_count="179">Thankfully, the food at Whitehall is less literally British than British-inflected. Mashed potatoes, for instance, appear on the menu just once. There’s London Pride on tap, and one of the cocktails contains marmalade, but most of the wines are Australian, and so is the chef, whose menu is inspired by Britain’s former colonies. The oysters Kilpatrick may be New York’s only example of the Antipodean speciality, the ultimate in canapé kitsch. Here they are briny little Fanny Bay specimens, doused in a vinegary dressing and topped with cubes of bacon. They melt under the heat of the broiler and go down quivering and gooey. Another unusual appetizer, equally successful, is described simply as grilled squid but might also be called Commonwealth chorizo. It’s served in a skillet, alongside potatoes, sausage, and arugula, and has the funky, burnt-caramel aftertaste of Worcestershire sauce. On the side, bread is served with Gentleman’s Relish, a lip-puckering anchovy paste made from a secret recipe in a factory in Elsenham, England, and, as the name suggests, beloved by idle aristocrats.</p><p data-wc="160" word_count="160">As at a real British pub, many patrons seem primarily intent on drinking, filling up only incidentally on appetizers and multiple orders of chips and HP sauce. The front room looks like a London Underground station, all gleaming white tiles and iconic black benches, but eating is best done in the quieter, wood-panelled parlor, where there’s enough elbow room to tackle the excellent lamb chops. The mushy-pea fritters that come with them are pleasingly green, rather than bruised brown, and are particularly addictive dipped in a side of Mum’s mint sauce. Dessert brings another old-fashioned delight, a Honeycrisp-apple charlotte for two. Whitehall may be a name associated with office workers, but when the genteel and elegant charlotte is presented tableside, with a flourish of sabayon on top, it’s enough to make the nine-to-fivers feel like they belong to a different class altogether.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/09/tertulia	Tertulia	359 Sixth Ave. 	53.7558567	-1.4654847	646-559-9909	2012/01/09	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="142" word_count="142">In a city of transience, few restaurants hold both our imagination and their leases for very long. Tertulia, in the West Village—a tapas bar only recently excavated from its brick foundation by the chef Seamus Mullen, formerly of Boqueria—feels like it’s been there all along. The trappings are substantial, and have the implication of a previous life in Spain. A large tarnished mirror advertising northern regional seafood specialties in euros serves as wall décor, slatted wooden banquettes trimmed with wrought iron and tile look as though they were lifted from a public square in a northwestern hamlet, and an old barrel with six functional taps adds to the Asturian-cider-house aesthetic. The wine list is accessible in two forms: hanging chalkboards or hefty slabs of slate. You’ll want to peruse it while you wait, for wait you will.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">The menu consists of small dishes ranging from bites to bowlfuls, and the starters—meats, cheeses, toasts—sound dangerously simple enough to skip, but they should not be overlooked. The <em>pan con tomate</em> is an experience much greater than the sum of its ordinary parts: garlic-and-oil-rubbed toast, smeared with a thin layer of tomato. Dry-cured meats such as <em>cabecero</em>, <em>sobrassada</em>, and chorizo, served on thick wooden boards, afford a chance to see a manual fly-wheel Berkel slicer in action (Mullen had a vintage model custom refurbished in Italy). A take on the <em>cojonudo</em> replaces the traditional chorizo with bites of pig’s cheeks topped with quail egg on toast rounds. Its meaning falls somewhere between “brilliant” and “ballsy,” and one may feel as much having ordered it.</p><p data-wc="210" word_count="210">To follow, there are straightforward standards as well as imaginative twists on classic tapas. Crispy cubes of <em>patatas bravas</em>, covered in fiery <em>pimentón</em> and drizzled in aioli, are brought to the table in a small frying pan. <em>Croquetas de jamón</em>, creamy fritters filled with béchamel and chunks of <em>ibérico</em> ham, are served over an earthy quince paste. Fried <em>pimientos de padrón</em> are, true to their description, covered in “lots of sea salt”; that some are much spicier than others makes for a lively guessing game. <em>Arroz a la plancha</em>, an ingenious cross between risotto and paella, with wild mushrooms, <em>ibérico </em>ham, and snails that are foraged and then fed only basil, is creamy, crispy, and rich. Mullen, who was raised in Vermont, is a true Hispanophile, and it shows: his tortilla española is as bona fide as his Spanish accent, which is flawless. Most telling is his obsession with <em>jamón ibérico de bellota</em>, the finest and most expensive grade of Iberian ham, made from pigs fattened on acorns. Upon learning this fact, one diner noticed the nutty flavor and mused, “What would I taste like?” (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

Or else they may conclude that Mediterranean cooking made people loose with their money. For the cost of a proper dinner at Boulud Sud, anyway, you could probably bail out Spain. </p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">The executive chef, Aaron Chambers, who is of all things a lapsed vegetarian from Yorkshire, draws on cuisines from every corner of the “Middle Sea” and presents them in high style, with the poise, balance, and good service that one expects of a Boulud operation. The room, big, bright, and open, is hard to figure: its modern elegance is so muted you might mistake it for an airport business-class lounge. Legions of employees buzz around your table or watch you coolly, during lulls, from their stations in the open kitchen. This is not really a place for a date. The virtue, though, is that you keep your eyes on the plates that gradually overtake the tabletop—one elaborate confection after another, each full of subtle surprises. It’s a euro zone of color and taste; each plate soon becomes a mess.</p><p data-wc="217" word_count="217">The menu is ordered by provenance: Sea, Garden, and Farm. Chambers seems at home in each column, and in many ports. The kibbeh (Lebanese lamb meatballs served with little bits of Swiss chard and feta and pine nuts) and the rouget (a folded-over mullet filet grilled in a wrap of paper-thin cedarwood, with fennel and <em>espelettes</em>) manage to be both delicate and meaty at once. The sauces inspire even the headlong plate-wiper to stop, dip a fingertip, and touch it daintily to the tongue. The octopus expert fixated on the marcona-almond purée that kept a jumble of singed octopus arms afloat, while his Thessalonikan wife marvelled at the sardine <em>escabèche’s</em> sweet yet vinegary ooze and the pistachio-yogurt sauce that accompanied a little plate of baby beets. Chambers, it appears, has a knack for nuts. The desserts, conceived by the Tunisian pastry chef Ghaya Oliveira, are ambitious. That is to say, what arrives doesn’t always resemble what the menu led you to imagine. The Thessalonikan bestowed her laurels on the <em>givré</em>, a hollowed-out frozen grapefruit filled with grapefruit sorbet, a grapefruit jam, sesame foam, Turkish delight, and candied halvah, all of it sealed off with a lid of caramelized sesame <em>tuile</em>. Austerity it ain’t. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $26-$37.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/12/19/la-mar-cebicheria-peruana	La Mar Cebichería Peruana	11 Madison Ave. 	35.7970456984983	-81.4326389421198	212-612-3388	2011/12/19	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="116" word_count="116">Gastón Acurio is Peru’s most famous chef, with a TV show, some two dozen cookbooks, and more than thirty restaurants across the globe. This one, his first in New York, sets out to educate the local palate in the cuisine of his homeland. The menu is overloaded with Peruvian terms, and the restaurant’s Web site features a “gastronomical dictionary” to aid the bewildered. Sadly, this proselytizing zeal stops short of offering fried <em>cuy</em> (that’s guinea pig), a national specialty featured at other Acurio restaurants. The large duplex (in the old Tabla space) eschews strong national accents, except for the odd dried gourd lying around, in favor of a generic sleek upscale look.</p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">Peruvian cuisine is characterized by an array of cultural influences—not only Amerindian and Spanish but also Japanese, Chinese, and Italian—and an overwhelming fondness for the potato, which was domesticated in Peru around eight thousand years ago and of which the country cultivates more than three thousand varieties. The most famous dish, and the restaurant’s mainstay (as its name suggests), is ceviche. Acurio’s version is, if not a revelation, certainly far better than average. Fiery and fruity, it’s notable for the subtle balance of spice and citrus, and the impeccable quality of the fish. There are numerous creative variants, including one with creamy, peppery sea urchin laid over disks of scallop. <em>Tiraditos</em>, a related dish, cut like sashimi and often lacking ceviche’s onions, are similarly excellent. Other standouts include <em>anticuchos de corazón</em>, a grilled skewer of beef heart, muscular and alarmingly smooth, dressed in a tangy <em>huacatay</em> (black mint) sauce. One specialty, the <em>causa</em>—a cylinder of whipped potato topped with various ceviche-like concoctions—is well prepared, but it doesn’t seem destined to catch on.</p><p data-wc="181" word_count="181">Some dishes fare less well. In a <em>sudado</em>, or stew, of halibut and clams, the fish was dry, as if the broth (of white wine and <em>ají</em>, or chili pepper) had flushed out its native oils without infusing any other moisture. Anything involving chicken—the creamy <em>ají de gallina</em> stew, for instance—is mystifyingly insipid, to the point that you start to wonder if bland chicken is some sort of Peruvian tradition, possibly having to do with high altitude. A simpler explanation may be that Acurio’s attention is spread thinly among his many enterprises. The staff is universally charming but not universally clued in; announcing that you have a reservation can result in long whispered discussions, as if this were an entirely new concept. On a recent evening, a table polished off a varied order of ceviche, only to be confronted with yet more. “Yes, this is the food you <em>actually</em> ordered,” the waiter said, his smile suggesting that this is not an uncommon accident.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/12/12/the-beagle-hannah-goldfield	The Beagle	162 Avenue A 	30.0784219230769	-94.110273	212-228-6900	2011/12/12	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="157" word_count="157">It is firmly established on the Web site for the Beagle, an East Village restaurant and cocktail bar, that the place “is not named after the dog.” Lovers of the breed may find their crests falling; lovers of evolutionary theory, meanwhile, will be charmed by the bathroom doors, labelled not “Men” and “Women” but “Charles” and “Emma,” as in Darwin. Aha: the Beagle, as in His Majesty’s Ship. Thankfully, the theme is manifest in little else but the tasteful, vaguely nineteenth-century décor—dark wood, dim lights, antique wallpaper—a style that has long been the mark of Portland, Oregon, the fashionably quaint home town of the Beagle’s owner, Matt Piacentini. That city has had quite an influence on New York’s restaurant scene—seasonal menus, Mason jars, barkeeps with beards and vests—and at the Beagle it extends even to the clientele, who seem more relaxed and less painfully hip than the neighborhood standard.</p><p data-wc="186" word_count="186">The produce-driven food and craft drinks are best enjoyed in the form of the pairing boards, which, though priced like appetizers, are more like generous amuses-bouches. Earthy tarragon fingerling sweet potatoes, slicked with uni and washed down with a musky Spanish sherry, made for a thrilling forest-meets-ocean effect, while the lusciousness of seared foie gras, served with rosemary, caramelized shallots, and salty-sweet black-olive shortbread, was cut perfectly by chilled, sweet Pineau des Charentes. It’s probably wise to pass over the “tidbits” and starters—baby corn cobs looked like they got lost on their way to a Chinese stir-fry and drowned in a blob of mayonnaise; an heirloom-lettuce salad was almost insultingly small—and jump straight to the entrées. Brussels sprouts in oyster broth were good enough to distract from an unexciting fillet of amberjack, and it was nearly impossible to keep from ravenously attacking the crispy half chicken, served with hearty chestnut spaetzle and a questionably named but unquestionably delicious “liver sauce.” Dry-aged duck, sliced over farro with endive and apple, showcased the bird’s lean meat and fatty skin at their most superb. </p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">In this age of mixology, it seems perfectly reasonable to top off a meal with drinks instead of dessert. No matter that chocolate custard, with cornflakes and grapefruit, and cranachan, a dollop of Scotch-infused, oat-flecked whipped cream beside a few apple slices, are as appetizing as they sound; the Beagle’s artfully composed cocktails will make you forget you skipped the sweets. The White Monkey (pisco, dry vermouth, orgeat, lemon juice, milk, and bitters) somehow exactly evokes the flavor of a Granny Smith apple, and the Hop Over (I.P.A., Falernum, genever, and orange-blossom water) is like beer-flavored soda pop, on the rocks.

You’ve been waiting for well over an hour for the chance to eat at what is undoubtedly New York’s trendiest farm-to-table Jewish-deli/Chinese-restaurant mash-up. You run down the street as if about to miss a flight, and enter a dining room that feels less farmhouse than economy-class cabin. The walls may be whitewashed, and the bathroom may be covered in gingham wallpaper, but there are two distinct aisles, and to get anywhere requires a cavalcade of apologies. You can’t shake the suspicion that a beverage cart will come trundling past your table. </p><p data-wc="216" word_count="216">The crowds are here because RedFarm is a Chinese restaurant like no other. There are middle-aged men, perhaps refugees from Ollie’s uptown, crowded around the bar; cool girls singing “Happy Birthday” to a friend on “the bad side of twenty-five”; cocktails made with sugar-free vodka for a lady who is “completely off sugar.” The fact that there are cocktails at all—not to mention a Yellowtail-free wine list—is unusual. The menu, made up of starters, dim sum, main courses, and noodles, is even more surprising. The best of the lot might be the kung-pao dumplings, in which a chicken dumpling is buried below peanuts and finely cubed onions and peppers. It’s an ingenious take on the go-to takeout option, a brilliantly simple invention that makes you wonder why it’s not everywhere. Other dishes are presented with uncommon sophistication, too, like the lobster dumplings, which come in a mini martini glass with an olive slice, and a filet-mignon tart, more curried than Chinese. Also not particularly Chinese are the Kumamoto oysters, served with caviar and topped with a slushie-like Meyer-lemon-and-yuzu ice. The frozen concoction is too sweet, and winds up overpowering the oyster, but this is a case of the kind of overthinking that’s bound to occur in such a playful kitchen.</p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">“Farm-to-table” here boils down to more vegetables than you’d normally see in a Chinese restaurant, cooked to an al-dente crispness rather than steamed to oblivion. The old-school deli influence seems harder to trace, with the exception of the soon-to-be cult dish on par with Momofuku’s pork buns: a deep-fried pastrami egg roll with hot-mustard sauce, which is exactly as delicious as it sounds. On a recent evening, a manager bringing out a doggie bag recalled a “Curb Your Enthusiasm” episode in which Larry reprimands his date for stealing the last of an order of dumplings (which came, incidentally, from NoHo’s Chinatown Brasserie, where RedFarm’s Joe Ng is also the executive chef). It seems safe to say that Larry would guard RedFarm’s dim sum with equal ferocity. (Open daily for dinner. Dim sum $7-$19; entrées $15-$39.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

An excerpt: “Away from it all. Beneath it all.” Did the artist’s epigrammatic style subliminally influence Meyer and his executive chef, Chris Bradley (formerly of Gramercy Tavern)? Note the motto, printed on the paper placemats at their farm-to-table update of a traditional coffee shop: “Breakfast all day. Lunch all morning.” </p><p data-wc="194" word_count="194">Some call it brunch. No surprise then that the place is jam-packed on weekends, when art lovers, couples with toddlers and in-laws in tow, and tourists wait on benches for the first-come-first-served tables. (The lucky score one of the upholstered booths that bookend the space, but the airy room has no bad tables.) Service, while friendly, is less than impeccable. On one recent Sunday, a party of four was seated in just twenty minutes and drink orders were taken immediately, but an hour and a query later, a Bloody Mary had still not materialized. Happily, glasses of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and cups of Stumptown coffee arrived right away. Kudos went to an Americano with the ideal ratio of water to espresso. Not so for the chocolate egg cream, which one native New Yorker and self-proclaimed expert deemed long on syrup and short on seltzer. But other classic diner fare—a fluffy stack of huckleberry-topped buttermilk pancakes, a crisp and golden grilled cheese, a hamburger upgraded with beef from Pat LaFrieda and savory roasted tomato—hit the spot unimpeachably, as did a breakfast bowl of cheese grits under two perfectly poached eggs and chard-covered toast.</p><p data-wc="180" word_count="180">On weekend evenings, the restaurant forgoes its panoply of omelettes, Greek salads, and tuna melts and pares things down to a three-course prix-fixe dinner. The simple menu changes weekly. One mid-autumn night started strong with a robust Caesar salad that swapped kale for romaine, a fine match for the authentically anchovy-laced dressing. But it plummeted in one sip of a mushroom velouté so bland and watery that any self-respecting roux would disown it. Grilled brisket was succulent, but seared Nantucket Bay scallops on a bed of grits—renamed polenta for the after-dark set—were oversalted, if brightened by a scattering of pickled chanterelles. The dessert options were a trio of local cheeses and a forgettable pear upside-down cake. The latter was nearly redeemed by a scoop of Brooklyn’s Blue Marble vanilla ice cream, until a memory surfaced of the brownie sundae, root-beer float, and milkshake, all of which were contenders at breakfast.

He was meticulously plating several “tartinettes,” crunchy peasant bread topped with things like hazelnut-and-orange-zest pesto, heavenly <em>aligot</em> (potatoes whipped with Cantal cheese), rich, slow-braised oxtail with gherkins and caper berries, and anchovies atop thick slabs of salted butter.</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">The room, styled to evoke a Provence kitchen—with carefully arranged baskets, rolling pins, mezzalunas—is romantic, at times verging on precious. “These are the smallest water bottles I’ve ever seen,” one woman said upon receiving a tiny carafe and a bubble-shaped glass (glassette?) that appeared to hold about an ounce of water. A barrage of little things with big flavor followed: a glass jar of salty, creamy chicken-liver mousse; a crock of <em>brandade de morue</em>, also salty, and just a tad fishy; <em>poireaux en vinaigrette</em>, leeks laced with mustard; savory, meaty lentils with kale. After a while, you get used to the diminutive proportions and start to look forward to having just a bite or two of everything—such as the exemplary “viandes,” which might include creamy rabbit potpie; coq au vin, deeply infused with wine, soft and tender; and perhaps the smallest cassoulet in the world.</p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">A <em>buvette</em> is a place to eat or drink at any time of the day, and that is exactly what Williams provides. In the mornings, it’s a casual meeting place for neighborhood folks looking for a little politesse and Gruyère (not to mention a La Colombe café au lait). At night, what Buvette lacks in floor space it makes up for in good will. After an extended round of musical chairs at the back communal table one evening, a charming waitress made amends, telling a group, “Dessert is obviously on us.” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Kajitsu achieves both with its haute Japanese food, which gives the dining tradition known as <em>kaiseki</em> a Zen Buddhist twist. The restaurant serves <em>shojin ryori</em>, or “devotion cuisine,” one tenet of which is an objection to taking life. Meat and fish are prohibited, and vegetables, nuts, and legumes are served strictly and respectfully within season; the menu changes each month. The spare décor is in keeping with the pursuit of enlightenment through asceticism: the colors are neutral, the volume is hushed, and the joinery of the wooden tables is flush, as though nails would be a distraction. Stepping into the restaurant, which is below street level, is not unlike entering a spa; you half expect to hear the trickling sound of a waterfall.</p><p data-wc="229" word_count="229">The menu comes in four- or eight-course options, and choosing between the two is akin to deciding whether your massage should last for forty-five or sixty minutes. In October, dinner began with a terrine of autumn vegetables set in a clear gel of agar, atop a turnip purée sprinkled with chestnut crumbs and <em>sudachi</em> zest. The colors on the plate went from green to yellow to orange to red, mimicking the changing foliage across Japan from north to south. Next came a bowl of red miso soup with a maitake-mushroom tempura on a bundle of silky, sweet Japanese eggplant. A bowl of springy udon noodles with slivers of chayote in sesame sauce required especial dexterity with chopsticks but was worth every splash. A bland course of slow-simmered vegetables was upstaged by a stone platter of assorted grilled vegetables enhanced by flame and seasonings: smoked soy sauce, a wedge of <em>sudachi</em>, and a pinch of Maldon sea salt. With them came a crispy mushroom croquet and pillowy rectangles of <em>nama-fu</em>, an elastic protein made of wheat gluten and millet flour. Though treacherous to celiac sufferers and gluten-averse faddists alike, <em>nama-fu</em> is a staple of <em>shojin</em>, and could easily be consumed by the plateful. Apparently modern Buddhists get to eat dessert, in this case a ball of mashed sweet potato over coconut tofu cream, served with walnuts and Macadamia nuts.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">The original meaning of <em>kaiseki</em> derives from the kanji symbols for “bosom” and “stone” and refers to monks’ practice of putting warm stones in the folds of their robes to stave off hunger before a tea ceremony. At Kajitsu, the traditional matcha tea, bright-green and hand-frothed, arrives as an epilogue to the meal, which, unless you’re a vegan or a Japanophile, is not guaranteed to ward off cravings for postprandial ice cream.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/07/monument-lane	Monument Lane	103 Greenwich Ave. 	41.7309120263158	-71.4758258157895	212-255-0155	2011/11/07	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="176" word_count="176">Lined with ho-hum cafés, shops, and remnants of St. Vincent’s hospital, Greenwich Avenue always seems more dishevelled than the ultra-gentrified precincts to its west. But before the Revolutionary War, when most of the area was still fields, part of the street led to a monument honoring General James Wolfe and his victory over the Québécois, and was known as Monument Lane. The restaurateur Josh Früm has spun this historical perspective into a kind of theme for the new restaurant he opened in April. One wall is dominated by a reproduction of Bernard Ratzer’s 1767 map of New York; on another is a Betsy Ross American flag, an eighteenth-century Union Jack, and a Dutch flag. Tables made from salvaged antique doors have a weather-beaten patina, and lights above the bar rest on a sleigh-like wooden pig carrier from a meatpacking plant. Ironically enough, Früm’s historical efforts were opposed by the Historic Districts Council, which hoped to preserve the metal Art Moderne façade of the previous tenant, a Caribbean diner. </p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">So much for the history lesson; how’s the food? Early reviews were gently deprecating, and the original chef, an alumnus of Picholine, soon left. On a visit a month ago, the impression was of an establishment treading water. The original menu had been retained, and the food was neither good nor bad. Dishes sounded better on the menu than they appeared on the plate. The place seemed uncertain whether it was meant to be a foodie destination (striped bass with fennel fronds for two) or an unambitious neighborhood hangout (meatloaf).</p><p data-wc="185" word_count="185">However, a new chef, Robert Berry, formerly of Cookshop, took over a few weeks ago and has effected an instant and considerable improvement. He kept the most successful dishes from the old menu (a perfect lobster roll) and ditched clichés both high end and low. Execution is vastly improved: witness the pillowy, snowy perfection of a boudin-blanc appetizer. Ham biscuits meant for nibbling are mini-popovers sandwiching a small curl of ham and a dollop of molasses butter—tiny parcels of satisfaction, which get eaten in seconds. Among more substantial dishes, a standout is Adam’s Virginia Ham and Farm Eggs—a chicken-and-pork broth filled with poached egg, flecks of ham, cranberry beans, sweet potato, kale, salsa-verde-laden bread, and purslane. The ingredients are an inspired mix of the obvious and the slightly unusual, and together they produce an unself-conscious but completely distinctive dish, perfect for fall. Without seeming to strive for novelty—or history—Berry has introduced a vibe of informal inventiveness into a venture that can seem too hung up on earnest research.

It could just as easily apply to the Leopard, the restaurant that Gianfranco and Paula Bolla Sorrentino, the owners of Il Gattopardo in midtown, opened this year in the former Café des Artistes. That restaurant, which was established in 1917, was, of course, an uptown landmark—in its final decades, its romantic floral displays, elegant Howard Chandler Christy murals, and plates of Wiener schnitzel made it one of the city’s last outposts of Old World glamour. It closed in 2009, a loss that some people evidently still haven’t come to terms with. “What an awful name!” read a post on the <em>Times</em>’<em>s</em> Web site regarding the Leopard. Another added, hopefully, “Perhaps all this will disappear as time goes on.”</p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">But the Leopard at des Artistes doesn’t seem likely to disappear anytime soon. It’s the kind of convivial, unpretentious place that, in the end, is practically un-hatable. As before, the atmosphere is the star, though it’s been updated: the floors are polished wood and terrazzo; magnolia branches line the leaded windows; and Christy’s murals—pink-cheeked, pre-Botox nymphs frolicking in a lush tropical paradise—have been restored to their original, vintage-porny glory. It’s worth a trip just to sit at one of the candle-lit tables, sipping a goblet of Tintore and watching the tastefully blinged-out clientele file past.</p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">But unlike at other historic restaurants with buzzy new incarnations and Animal Planet names—hello, Monkey Bar!—the food at the Leopard is far from an afterthought. The Sorrentinos stick to old-style Sicilian cuisine. A tip for ordering: simple is better. Burrata, a special on a recent night, came with speck, wrapped in a purple cabbage leaf; it was delicate and not too creamy, but it was upstaged, later, by plain old mozzarella and tomatoes. Pappardelle with roasted rabbit was, surprisingly, less flavorful than pasta alla Norma—kinky noodles with basil-streaked tomato-and-eggplant sauce. Neither was as good as the <em>trofie</em>—firm shards of pasta mixed with a bright, earthy almond-and-pistachio pesto. Among the entrées, the dorado, cooked with lemon, oregano, and olive oil, and the tender veal loin, similarly prepared, proved to be better bets than the lamb loin (dry), or the signature meatloaf, which was like an oversized meatball crying out for pasta. The splashiest dessert item: <em>zabaione</em> with berries—egg yolks and Marsala wine, beaten tableside over an open flame, until it reaches the consistency of a sugary, alcoholic cloud. Here’s hoping things stay as they are for a little while longer. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $17-$90.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/24/st-anselm	St. Anselm	355 Metropolitan Ave., Brooklyn 	40.71426675	-73.9560448291932	718-384-5054	2011/10/24	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="180" word_count="180">It’s easy to forget—unless you live on a farm or spend a lot of time in Chinatown—that a chicken has feet, and a neck, and a head. It may come as something of a shock, then, to order the innocent-sounding sweet-tea-brined young chicken at St. Anselm, a new Joe Carroll-owned grill in Williamsburg (on the same block as his barbecue pit, Fette Sau, and his beer garden, Spuyten Duyvil), and learn that it will arrive stripped of nothing but its feathers. Ask too many questions, and your server might tell you that guinea pigs in Peru are served with their heads on, “to prove they’re not cats.” There’s plenty of time, fortunately, to forget that conversation ever happened—certain meats, the menu warns, require up to forty-five minutes—and there are plenty of appetizers to pass that time. Salads are a good start: Bibb lettuce with fried shallots and cherry tomatoes is surprisingly complex, dressed in a vinaigrette with a subtle note of licorice, and pea shoots topped with grilled haloumi taste of pure garden.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">When the chicken arrives, it’s possible to find a sort of beauty in its charred appendages, especially given that the more familiar parts are quite tasty. Proponents of nose-to-tail eating will be happy to see that the menu also offers head-on prawns, as well as several varieties of whole fish. Those who prefer not to look their food in the eye, however, will fare best at St. Anselm. None of the fine beef, lamb, and pork cuts resemble the animals they came from—despite the restaurant’s décor, which, with handsaws as wall hangings and buzz saws as light fixtures, conjures a crude butcher’s shop. Never mind: the juicy pink pork chop tastes delightfully of the bourbon in which it was brined; the tender, gamy lamb saddle marries perfectly with a dollop of tangy mint yogurt; and the inexpensive hanger steak, cooked medium rare, is a bloody steal. </p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">St. Anselm (with whom Carroll’s grandfather shared a name) was a Benedictine monk who made the first ontological argument for the existence of God. St. Anselm’s dessert menu makes a less than convincing argument for the existence of a pastry chef. There is little appealing about a half-full jar of peanut butter surrounded by chunks of chocolate (unless, of course, you’re stoned), and a plate of marshmallows, strawberries, and crumbled graham crackers drizzled in chocolate sauce looks like what happens when a four-year-old is left alone in a pantry. An excellent vanilla ice cream from Il Laboratorio del Gelato is the one saving grace, and the nose-to-tail crowd will be pleased to find that its garnish of spicy crackling, brittle enough to rattle the skull, is indeed fried pig skin. Waste not, want not. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $15-$39.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/17/miss-lilys-favourite-cakes	Miss Lily’s Favourite Cakes	132 W. Houston St. 	32.3436526666667	-95.3011461754386	646-588-5375	2011/10/17	<p data-wc="77" word_count="77">This Jamaican jerk hut makes for another buzzy opening from Serge Becker, the New York night-life king best known for La Esquina and the adult-oriented cabaret joint the Box. Miss Lily’s is a little racy, too; the name plays on cakes of both the carrot and the cannabis variety, and an enormous print of a busty girl in a wet T-shirt hangs by the entrance. As with La Esquina, the food seems completely beside the point.</p><p data-wc="294" word_count="294">But while most people are not coming here for a square meal, it’s certainly possible to assemble one. In fact, the menu is full of oddly heavy choices for what is really a night club, and dinner has an unfussy, home-cooked feel. Everyone’s favorite thing to eat is the festival, a deep-fried corn muffin shaped like a mini-baguette; on a stick, it wouldn’t be out of place at the Iowa State Fair. It’s probably meant for sopping up sauces, but a basket of festivals will inevitably disappear before any other food hits the table. The entrées are substantial, though not always exciting. A vegan bushman plate is about as joyless as it sounds: giant mounds of jerk seitan, tasting a little like packing peanuts, with unadorned couscous and callaloo, a Caribbean leafy green. It’s nice to see goat—one of the more environmentally friendly meats—appearing on more menus, but Miss Lily’s particular take on the traditional Jamaican goat curry fails to hide its essential stringiness, and getting through it feels like work. The best of the main dishes is a whole steamed fish: snapper, spicy and sweet in the right measure, with an addictively crispy skin. There are multilayered cakes displayed diner-style up front, but they taste as if they’re just for show; the better dessert choice is Grape Nut ice cream, which must be the center of the Venn diagram of Jamaica and Northeastern college campuses. It’s just the thing before a long night out, for which most of the patrons here seem to be preparing. “I’ll just put this order in and let you hang for a while,” the effortless waitress said on a recent evening, unencumbered by pen or pad.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The diners, on the other hand, appear to be trying very hard. If there’s a distinct feeling you’ve been seated according to how well you’re dressed, take comfort in the fact that the competition is stiff. In one corner, there’s a guy in a skirt and a woven porkpie hat; in another, several girls in a uniform of denim shorts, topknots, and wire-rimmed glasses. Re-creating Jamaica in a narrow nook on Houston Street was always going to be tough. But if it weren’t for Miss Lily’s reservations policy, and her prices, this could be Brooklyn.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/earls-beer-cheese	Earl’s Beer & Cheese	1259 Park Ave. 	42.3358534	-83.0513643	212-289-1581	2011/10/10	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="153" word_count="153">Disheartened Upper East Siders mutter now and then about opening a basic mug-and-grub joint in their part of town, to remedy the fact that no one else has in the dozen years since the demise of a dive called the Madison Pub. But earlier this year word started getting around about an odd establishment called Earl’s Beer &amp; Cheese, on Park Ave. just north of Ninety-seventh Street, in a kind of eddy between Carnegie Hill and East Harlem. Earl’s is very small, which is both a boon (to its fish-out-of-water, Avenue C aura) and a nuisance (to anyone aspiring to be a patron). It is usually so packed—it draws a heavy Mt. Sinai contingent—that the mutterers can’t even get in to try the place they’ve been spreading the word about (or wishing they’d opened themselves). This may, in fact, keep the Carnegie Hillers from ruining the place.</p><p data-wc="140" word_count="140">Earl’s is principally a bar specializing in craft beers; each day sees a new set of four drafts—say, an ale described as “dirty,” an I.P.A. with a “pine finish,” a pumpkin porter, and a stout tasting of crème brûlée. (There’s also beer in cans and organic wine.) You order food at the bar, which is a small booth in the back corner, and eat it at a big communal table or at a stool along the wall. Service time can vary; it got glacial on a recent evening when an inspector from the Health Department, wearing a Captain America pin on his lapel, dropped in at prime time to give the kitchen a pop quiz. A half hour later, the inspector, occupying a highly coveted stool, handed the owner his grade: A.</p><p data-wc="197" word_count="197">The menu consists of just eight or nine excursions in the key of cheese. These range from a simple cheese board—four local varieties, served on a sheet of brown paper, with their names written out in marker (Humble Pie, Bayley Hazen, Pipe Dreams, etc.)—to some bizarre and brilliant inventions. (The chef, Corey Cova, previously worked in the galley of a Navy submarine and the kitchen at Momofuku Ssäm Bar.) For example, a lipid cannonball that goes by the name Asian gnocchi consists of scrolled rice cakes, spicy, garlicky ground beef, and mini cheese fries, in a single-serve cauldron. There are three kinds of grilled-cheese sandwich. The Calabro-mozzarella variation (on a toasted English muffin, with miso mayonnaise, ridged potato chips, and sliced pickles) strikes a peerless balance between high and low, and crunch and ooze. The most intrepid white-glove/white-trash combo is the now notorious Earl’s Eggo—a toasted waffle with slabs of cheddar, cured bacon, and foie gras, and a sweet sauce that the menu calls “syzzurpy goodness.” Eating frequently at Earl’s may result in untimely death; at least this could keep the numbers down.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/legend-bar-restaurant	Legend Bar & Restaurant	88 Seventh Ave., between 15th and 16th Sts. 	null	null	null	2011/10/03	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="175" word_count="175">When you go to another country, it’s best to be adaptable. If you visit India, for instance, you will have a better time if you relinquish the concept of queues, and just accept that large groups move into small spaces there as an amoeba, not in a line. Fight it and you will only suffer: resistance is futile. Legend Bar &amp; Restaurant is not in another country, it is in Chelsea, but it serves food from several other places; namely, China, Vietnam, Japan, and Thailand. It is advisable, though, to go there with the flexibility you might reserve for foreign travel—if you arrive expecting logic and efficiency, you will leave feeling frustrated. But if you simply shrug your shoulders when a dish ordered at another table arrives at yours (or vice versa) and you are braced for a long wait (thirty minutes, on a recent evening, before a beverage order was taken), you will be free to savor the food, which is well worth the journey. (For the armchair traveller, Legend does offer delivery.)</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The Dan Dan noodles, springy and toothsome, with a funky, savory sauce of fermented bean paste and ground pork—an earthy proto-Bolognese—remind you that pasta originated in China, not Italy. The succulent Chengu Duck swims in a broth studded with tree-ear mushrooms, leeks, and Sichuan peppercorns, with their numbing, somehow lemony, sour heat. The pungent peppercorns are integral to many of the dishes at Legend, where Sichuan is the house specialty, from the delicious and aptly named Hot and Spicy Crispy Prawns to the dry sautéed pig intestines with dried red chile. Balance such things with the grassy bitterness of Chinese broccoli or the delicious homemade bacon with green leeks to avoid oral heatstroke.</p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">The Southeast Asian fare on Legend’s voluminous menu is perfectly adequate, but it makes no sense to order it at a restaurant where the chef, Ding Gen Wang, previously of Grand Sichuan Eastern, is the main attraction, at least for the patrons who’ve come to eat. Legend also has a following among karaoke enthusiasts—usually young, Chinese-American, and fairly drunk—who take the stage downstairs on weekend nights and are a trip indeed.

But does the nation’s capital of artisanal bitters really need another nostalgia-soaked outpost for herb muddling? In the case of the pitch-perfect Maison Premiere, which complements its absinthe-slanted cocktail menu with a very fresh raw bar, the answer is absolutely.</p><p data-wc="210" word_count="210">The co-owners Josh Boissy and Krystof Zizka (of the Brooklyn bistro Le Barricou) enlisted the designers John and Kevin McCormick (who helped turn back the clock at Freemans) to create an interior so convincingly bygone—from the horseshoe-shaped bar, with its green marble absinthe fountain, to the print of Napoleon near the rest room—that you may feel as if you’ve stumbled into the Belle Époque scene in Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris.” Not that you’re likely to find the director in the crowd, which swells during the dollar-per-oyster happy hour—and not just because the median age of Maison Premiere’s patrons hovers somewhere below thirty. Allen once quipped, “I will not eat oysters. I want my food dead.” The only cooked options here are succulent chilled lobster, crab legs, and a shrimp cocktail worth ordering just for the addictive kick of its sauce. (Technically, the sorbet-cold red-snapper ceviche isn’t raw, either.) With more than thirty-three varieties of oysters on ice—Naked Cowboys from Long Island Sound, Beausoleils from New Brunswick, Moon Shoals from Massachusetts—the bivalve-averse should head elsewhere. There’s not so much as a bread stick to dunk in your quartet of condiments: mignonette, aioli, and horseradish, in addition to cocktail sauce.</p><p data-wc="164" word_count="164">One secret to Maison Premiere’s success (it already ranks among <em>Esquire</em>’<em>s</em> best bars of 2011) is its intimacy, which heightens the mood of Big Easy romance, as does the Delta-blues soundtrack. First dates might opt for a seat at the raw bar in the back, where expert shuckers offer something to focus on should conversation run dry. (A late-summer visit found the outdoor garden charming but rain-soaked.) The place is so popular that even three can feel like a crowd, especially after the arrival of the multi-tiered “La Grande” Plateau—that is, until the cocktails kick in. Eying a tabletop still-life of seafood with flute, coupe, and highball (drained of an egg-white-and-raspberry Clover Club, a champagne-and-Cognac Arnaud’s French 75, and an absinthe concoction known as Lafitte’s Swizzle), one usually reticent diner turned to the stranger on her left and announced, “This place is a little utopian.” (Open daily for dinner. Raw bar from $1.35 for a littleneck clam to $140 for “La Grande” Plateau.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

In the case of Alex Stupak—a disciple of Albert Adria’s school of dessert wizardry—and his wife, Lauren Resler, the result is an exceptional new Mexican restaurant in the West Village. After years of laboring over hydrocolloids at Wylie Dufresne’s WD-50, Stupak turns his attention from foams to <em>fundidos</em>, while Resler, formerly of Babbo, oversees the desserts. Dufresne, who called Stupak one of the best pastry chefs in the world, recently lamented that “fine dining lost a star.” On the other hand, the rest of us gained an unbeatable taco-and-tequila joint serving inventive, unfussy fare. Like Rick Bayless and Diana Kennedy before him, Stupak has gone in search of complexity in Mexican cuisine, and he’s found it in amalgams of spice and depth.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">Guests awaiting their parties are encouraged to have a drink at the bar, which is decorated with bottles of Espolón, a hand-crafted tequila, and an oddly esophageal mural of red-and-purple undulations. On one visit, the only available seat was next to a young man in a tailored jacket reading “The Selected Essays of Gore Vidal” on an iPad. Classic drinks like margaritas and micheladas come with a graciously half-salted rim, and the ¿<em>por qué no?</em>, an intriguing combination of silver tequila, cilantro, serrano chile, and pineapple, is a standout.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">Dinner begins with an entreaty to chips and guacamole, notable only for the smoked-cashew and árbol-chile salsas that accompany it. Coins of octopus and parsnip are impossible not to finish in a sauce of pleasing heft and slow-burning spice, made with árbol chile, chipotle, and pumpkin seeds. <em>Queso fundido</em>, with pea tendrils and mole poblano, is like a deconstructed, scoop-it-yourself quesadilla, and is best enjoyed with forgiving friends—melted cheese is not a dish for polite company. In tacos, Stupak pairs proteins like lobster, duck confit, and sweetbreads with authentic regional flavors like epazote, <em>tlatonile</em>, and avocado leaves. One night, a waitress revealed that the fish-tempura taco with cabbage and lime mayonnaise was made with “baby shark,” prompting one diner to wonder aloud, “Should I feel bad about this?” She should not; the term is a colloquialism for <em>cazón</em>, a small school shark common in Mexican cooking, and not the veal of the sea. Then came Resler’s desserts: an ethereal chocolate flan and a pillowy tres leches cake, each flanked by a perfect ellipsoid of ice cream. (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

If the Cub Room was a watering hole for bankers and bad first dates, the Dutch has taken up the mantle (but with better food): on a late-summer Monday when the Dow Jones had dropped more than six hundred points, one diner, whiskey sour in hand, surveying the buoyant mood, observed, “It doesn’t look like Black Monday in here.” Those without reservations might end up with the oyster shuckers up front, or in the barroom, where self-important fellows deign to fill cocktail orders, but that’s not such a bad thing, especially if the windows are flung open to let in the evening air. Those lucky enough to be whisked down a hall to the elegant, hushed oak back room, outfitted with suave round booths and plain wooden tables—vintage schoolhouse à la J. Crew—might wonder, “So what’s the theme? Like fifties something?”</p><p data-wc="162" word_count="162">The answer cannot be found on the menu, which shows influences from just about everywhere and seems organized according to mood. There’s a raw bar (oysters, peel-and-eat shrimp, seafood towers) and a pricey “dry-aged prime meats” section. There are “snacks”—a smoky mayo-heavy eggplant dip with sesame lavash or fried-oyster sliders, the perfect bite—as well as appetizers. An ethereal burrata with numerous varieties of heirloom tomatoes trumped a summer-lettuce salad, which seemed to be doused with musty spices from a long-lost cupboard. The odd “dressed crab, bloody mary, green goddess” (empress crab according to the waiter; peekytoe according to the more accurate busboy) was uneventfully lumped amidst a pool of the drink. The generously portioned entreés are where Carmellini reveals his enthusiasm: tender duck breast with pecan-studded dirty rice; succulent grilled quail with cashew mole and a poblano kick. Chicken smoked in-house, atop runner beans and more of those fine tomatoes, fell from the bone it was so moist.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">One evening, when asked why the renowned fried chicken wasn’t on offer, the waiter pointed out that it’s on the lunch and late-night menus, and besides, the challenge of coming up with something else “gives Chef something to do.” (For the record, the fried chicken is fresh and light, if a little heavy on the paprika-cayenne dusting, and accompanied by a highly worthy honey-glazed biscuit.) A chalkboard in the hallway hawks various oysters, “ice cold beer, stuff from Loire” and implores, “EAT PIE!!” Sweet peach with a lattice crust was summer on a plate; salted lime evoked a Florida sea breeze. Chef has a point. Who cares about a theme when there’s pie this good? (Open weekdays for lunch, weekends for brunch, and daily for dinner. Entrées $18-$52.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

His partner in the venture is Yoshiki Tsuji, who runs a culinary institute in Osaka and pretty much wrote the book on Japanese cooking (or, at least, appended a preface to a classic work on the subject by his father, Shizuo Tsuji). The chefs come from the cookery school, and some sense of the labor involved in producing such fanatically fiddly food may be gleaned from the fact that the restaurant’s vast open kitchen is just about as big as the dining room.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">There are two <em>kaiseki</em> set menus, one yet more elaborate than the other. Dishes arrive on wooden boards with a slightly adhesive waxy surface, so that artful presentations don’t slide around. Each plate is different: the bowl containing a jumbo Pacific oyster mimics the frilly shape of the oyster’s shell, while the oyster itself lurks beneath a spume of plum-wine-flavored gelatin. The fish dishes (a scallop-and-lobster dumpling, like a scoop of ice cream; miso cod with a sea urchin glommed onto its side, like a barnacle on a boat) are on balance more interesting than the meat ones (duck salad with a plumlike Japanese eggplant; wagyu beef with sansho pepper). A star of the menu is an unbelievably delicate <em>chawanmushi</em> custard with crab and truffles. Desserts are a study in transformations with recherché ingredients like powdered honey and baked rice paper.</p><p data-wc="200" word_count="200">Though <em>kaiseki</em> is the restaurant’s raison d’être, more casual diners can get sushi and other small plates in the bar area. There is fermented tofu, which is created with an Okinawan <em>koji</em> mold; it’s not only more pungent than regular tofu but more resilient in texture. The barman Gen Yamamoto creates cocktails with unusual ingredients, like heirloom tomatoes. A few weeks ago, explaining that he’d passed a farmer’s market on his way in from New Jersey and thought the peas looked good, he extemporized a drink of green peas and shochu with shisito pepper. The bar area has a trapezoidal floor plan narrowing to a shardlike nook in one corner and is lined with books set spine-inward, as if waiting for Rachel Whiteread to make a sculpture of them. (For some reason, there’s one spine on view: “The White House Transcripts.”) Set in tiny alcoves in the walls’ literary lining are miniature dioramas of traditional Japanese life. Arguably, though, an even better microcosm of Japan is found in the bathrooms, which feature textured walls, altarlike granite sinks, and terrifying computerized toilet seats.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/29/imperial-no-nine	Imperial No. Nine	9 Crosby St. 	43.6769783471675	-70.2948973829982	212-389-0000	2011/08/29	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="185" word_count="185">The Mondrian is a new hotel with an aggressively downtown demeanor in the neighborhood that real-estate brokers have taken to calling Solita. The hotel’s seafood restaurant feels like a cross between a JetBlue terminal and an expensive gym, catering to a transient crowd carrying wheelie suitcases and tiny Louis Vuitton handbags and shouting over very loud dance music. The restaurant rambles through several distinct rooms off the hotel lobby: a chilly, glass-domed greenhouse in which nothing grows; a bar area with a high, surfboard-shaped communal table; and a cavernous back dining room, decked out in the space-age style of Dr. Evil’s lair. Regardless of the room in which you are seated, the food, by the onetime “Top Chef” contestant Sam Talbot, is not easy to discern: the entire space is lit a violent shade of purple, a bruise that only gets darker as the evening proceeds. By the time dessert arrives, the composition of the plates can be a complete mystery. “Is that a marshmallow?” was an actual question asked, though not definitively answered, in regard to a mushy banana-bread pudding one evening.</p><p data-wc="160" word_count="160">The restaurant bills itself, modishly, as a purveyor of “sustainable seafood,” but the menu harks back, not unpleasantly, to the nineties, when “globalization” was a catchphrase and “fusion” wasn’t a dirty word. On a recent visit, the best dishes weren’t seafood at all but, rather, ingenious cross-cultural mashups, usually of a vegetal variety: a bountiful green salad with a tangy “blond miso yuzu vinaigrette”; buttery black chickpeas and raita; crisp nuggets of peanutty potato, served with an otherwise unremarkable skirt steak. But these small delights don’t add up to a satisfying meal, and the eclectic “global” flavors don’t work as well with the main event, the seafood, which often winds up overpowered. Crab legs in a sweet-and-sour sauce, a waiter’s favorite, may as well have been Chinese takeout chicken, and four chunks of octopus, each disconcertingly the size of a large man’s index finger, came swimming in soy and had the texture of sausage.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">As has become the fashion, you’ll be reminded at the start of your meal that the menu of small plates is “designed to be shared.” This piece of advice always feels a little bossy, and it also makes for difficult ordering: how can you insure a well-balanced meal when kimchi and a whole stone crab are presented as equivalents? Inevitably, the check adds up quickly, and it’s hard to feel at ease eating at a place so elaborately styled. Imperial No. Nine seems the sort of restaurant that people who are not from New York might think New Yorkers frequent, or, at least, frequented in the “Sex and the City” era. There’s only one appropriate ending to such a meal, and that’s a dessert cocktail. There are two to choose from: the Golden Cadillac and the Original Sin.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/15/the-castello-plan	The Castello Plan	1213 Cortelyou Rd., Brooklyn 	40.6403649	-73.9666929	718-856-8888	2011/08/15	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="201" word_count="201">To anyone who spends a lot of time in, say, midtown Manhattan, Ditmas Park, a historic district in western Flatbush, is a revelation: its wide, quiet streets are lined with sycamores and Victorian houses, and its central thoroughfare, Cortelyou Road, abundant with easygoing, independently owned shops and eateries, feels almost like Main Street, albeit grittier and more culturally diverse (this is still, after all, New York City). Among the most emblematic of Cortelyou’s establishments is the adjoining trifecta, with owners in common, of a hummus café called Mimi’s, a grocery called Market, and a wine bar, the Castello Plan. Named for an early map of lower Manhattan drawn by the seventeenth-century Dutch surveyor Jacques Cortelyou, the Castello Plan has an old-timey feel, evoking both a barn and a boat, all rough-hewn wood and glass, vintage scuba-diving helmets and clocks. The room is but a slip, and, especially at the narrow communal tables, it’s hard to avoid grazing noses, let alone making eye contact. On a recent evening, a pair of diners looking for their server found only a casually dressed gentleman hovering dreamily over their shoulders. “Um, are you a waiter?” one ventured. “I could be!” he replied.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">Regrettably, this cozy informality does not lend itself well to live music, which is featured twice weekly and can be deafening, and the food tends to suffer from the lack of order. The best offerings are straightforward and tasty, if a bit heavy: beer-battered shrimp, rib eye with puréed yam, rosewater panna cotta. The worst dishes smack, endearingly but unfortunately, of a freegan potluck, marked by wildly incongruous combinations like butter-poached squid atop smashed stone fruit, and fettuccine with hunks of blue cheese, sunflower seeds, and roasted peaches, drowning in brown butter. A dessert special of Riesling jello, encasing berries and crowned with what looked like whipped cream, appealed in its Mason jar, until the topping turned out to be a strikingly funky Camembert, sprinkled with coconut shavings. (An Uruguayan dessert wine that tasted like “a cupcake dunked in rum,” according to one would-be sommelier, did something for damage control.)</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">The Castello Plan may not be a culinary destination, but the wine list is extensive and interesting, sold convincingly by a gently professorial staff, and it’s a lovely place to have a glass or three. For a snack, order carefully (the charcuterie and cheese plates are a safe bet); for dinner, head two doors over, past the sidewalk backgammon players, to Mimi’s, for hummus so fresh and flavorful it might change your life, or at least expand your palate. It’s a great excuse for a stroll down the block. (Open daily for dinner and weekends for brunch. Entrées $14-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/08/the-highliner	The Highliner	210 Tenth Ave. 	-27.4933669	153.0502935	212-206-6206	2011/08/08	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="137" word_count="137">The Empire Diner, which graced the corner of Twenty-second Street and Tenth Avenue for thirty-four years, was a New York superstar. Its Art Deco façade had a cameo in Woody Allen’s “Manhattan” in 1979, it was depicted on the cover of this magazine in 2010, and it still flickers by in the opening credits for “Saturday Night Live.” The food was nothing special, but they had live piano, and they were open all night long, even when far-west Chelsea was something of a foreboding wasteland. Many of the neighborhood’s pioneers agreed with the establishment’s tagline and self-assessment: the hippest diner on earth. In May, the Empire closed its doors, and, without substantial renovation, the proprietors of Coffee Shop have opened a new restaurant there called the Highliner. The body remains, but the soul has vanished.</p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">The Highliner is representative, though, of the new Chelsea that is emerging on weekends, as visitors flood the elevated park the restaurant is named after: touristy, overpriced, and shiny. It is not uncommon to see guidebooks and maps spread out on the nascent eatery’s outdoor tables. Of course, tourists need to eat, too, but at the Highliner they do not get to eat particularly well. On various visits, hamachi arrived in hulking hunks, a steak ordered medium rare came out gray through and through, and a lemon roasted chicken, though crispy-skinned and nicely moist, had none of the promised citrusy zing and lacked flavor in general. </p><p data-wc="155" word_count="155">Still, the place has its merits: what the servers lack in skill, which is plenty, they almost make up for in joie de vivre. Late on a Thursday night some weeks ago, a waiter who has since departed for Broadway serenaded a table with a vibrant rendition of “On the Street Where You Live.” Unfortunately, he also neglected to bring one patron her dinner, and by the time he realized his mistake, the kitchen was closed. A leisurely weekend brunch is when the staff’s cheerful incompetence feels the most appropriate, and the Highliner offers solid Bloody Marys, good, thick-cut bacon, and, idiosyncratically, a tasty farro salad spiked with crisp bits of cauliflower. (The hash browns, however, were a pile of shredded white nonsense.) The Highliner is not open all night like its predecessor, but, given the new clientele, nobody in the neighborhood is complaining.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/01/the-smile	The Smile	26 Bond St. 	52.6347296	1.26692491767956	646-329-5836	2011/08/01	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="133" word_count="133">London’s Bond Street is known for high-end retail shops and fashion houses; its cobblestoned American cousin is a younger, artsier version, anchored by a Herzog and de Meuron luxury residence. The Smile, a charming subterranean café, is the casual social nexus for its bed-headed idlers. The owners, Carlos Quirarte and Matt Kliegman, who are the bearded duo behind the exclusive Jane Ballroom, have cultivated a cool crowd of bohemian types with a robust celebrity contingent, pint-size former child stars and quart-size mumblecore actresses alike. The executive chef, Melia Marden, is the daughter of the abstract painter Brice Marden, who, in the sixties, lived and worked in a studio upstairs from the restaurant. Her menu is chiefly American, with a few detours inspired by a lifetime of family vacations to Greece and Morocco.</p><p data-wc="208" word_count="208">A starter of minted sugar snap peas with olive oil and sea salt makes for delightfully crisp snacking; washed down with a glass of basil lemonade it’s the perfect late-afternoon refreshment. Those who prefer to lay real groundwork before dinner can dig through dips of roasted carrot, ground almond, and yellow split pea with miniature baguette slices. Mixed greens with slices of unripe plum are overpowered by raspberry balsamic vinegar, and those who order it might skip the accompanying goat-cheese crostini. For virtue as well as flavor, try the shaved raw sugar snap peas and julienned watermelon radishes; the bitterness of the vegetables is pleasingly muted by the acidity of a pink-grapefruit vinaigrette. Marden’s homey, straightforward entrées mostly succeed, and where they don’t the fixes are obvious. Slices of rosemary-and-oregano-roasted leg of lamb, with caper smashed potatoes and a dollop of tzatziki, are ideally married with dill, cucumber, and mint, and a delicate olive-oil-poached Arctic char with English peas is lent a salty bite from sautéed shiitake and hedgehog mushrooms. But a bowl of overcooked linguini and sautéed baby artichokes endures a custody battle between lemon and shaved Parmesan, and an undercooked pork chop is all but abandoned by dry white beans.</p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">Wooden shelves are full of tchotchkes—knitting kits by Wool and the Gang, Moscot vintage eyewear, and Mariage Frères tea. They’re all for sale, though they garner about as much interest as the six-pound cans of crushed tomatoes and tins of Bazzini nuts. The space was conceived as a general store, but it turns out that people like to sit and eat more than they like to stand and shop. Evenings at the Smile feel like an intimate dinner party with young tastemakers—you may worry about your outfit, but don’t. Marden, who was photographed in the nude by Robert Mapplethorpe at age three, defended him at age nine, saying, “Everybody was born without clothes.” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $15-$19.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/25/danji	Danji	346 W. 52nd St. 	41.57334376	-90.57672912	212-586-2880	2011/07/25	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="104" word_count="104">Danji, like any modest joint with a one-word name on an anonymous street, deploys a gimmick or two, even though it doesn’t need to. For example, when you sit down, a waitress says, “Your menus are in your drawers.” Beg pardon? She means that your table has drawers, and that your menus are in them. Once retrieved, these menus reveal that the fare is divided into two categories, “traditional” and “modern,” which the chef, Hooni Kim, a Korean-American from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and, more recently, from the persnickety kitchens at Masa and Daniel, doesn’t seem to heed too rigidly. </p><p data-wc="160" word_count="160">In general, Danji is neither orthodox ethnic nor smarty-pants fusion. It’s not K-town or Nobu. It’s comfortized Korean served in well-presented tapas portions, by friendly people, in a clean, well-lighted place with a well-tended bar. Things it would seem unimaginative to order turn out to be imaginatively made, such as the lightly crisped calamari with wasabi mayo, or a scallion-and-hot-pepper pancake that isn’t just spackle. Trickier-sounding selections are agreeably blunt; a kimchi-chorizo-and-bacon “paella” comes on a little cast-iron hot plate, with a fried egg on top—it’s a small world after all. On a recent tornado-ish night, there was, as a special, a traditional stew called <em>jjigae</em>, cooked with kimchi (Kim’s mother-in-law makes Kim’s kimchi) that had been aged for six months. A spoonful of <em>jjigae</em>, tart and bubbling like some kind of witch’s brew, was accompanied by the sight, out the window, of Hell’s Kitchen flotsam blowing sideways in a squall.</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">For bean-curd skeptics, the fried wedges of tofu, custard-soft and sprinkled with panko crumbs and drizzled in a scallion-ginger sauce, are as persuasive as a trip to Kyoto. Meaty counterarguments come in many forms, chief among them the <em>bulgogi</em> sliders (marinated and grilled brisket), which should make the appendix to every best-burger list in town. The advantage of going with a group of six or more is that, one, big groups are allowed to make a reservation, and, two, they can come close to trying everything on the menu, so that the meal becomes a soju-and-sake blur of pickled this and braised that, a cavalcade of little plates with no little flags indicating traditional or modern, and not a dud among them. A clarifying finish comes in the form of a purplish-gray scoop or two of black-sesame gelato, which you eat with a small wooden spoon. (Open weekdays for lunch and Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Plates $4-$16.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/11/robertas	Roberta’s	261 Moore St., Brooklyn 	40.7050062	-73.9335893	718-417-1118	2011/07/11	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="171" word_count="171">This gourmet pizza place, located amid a desolate-looking stretch of warehouses in Bushwick, is often described as a D.I.Y. enterprise. The label is slightly ambiguous—aren’t a lot of other restaurant entrepreneurs doing it themselves, too? Carlo Mirarchi, the chef at Roberta’s and one of its three co-owners (his partners, Chris Parachini and Brandon Hoy, are former musicians), suggested, the other day, that the difference is in the economics: “We just didn’t have any money when we started.” So they built things from scraps. Hence the cinder-block walls and the shipping container in the back yard, which hosts a radio station and a hothouse garden, made from PVC piping and Visqueen, on the roof. The restaurant doesn’t exactly feel undiscovered, but it’s out of the way enough that it’s not always mobbed, Manhattan style, and the décor—Christmas lights, pogo sticks—seems genuinely amateurish and unstudied. It’s the kind of operation you probably once dreamed of building in your parents’ garage.</p><p data-wc="197" word_count="197">The pizza? Chewy and perfectly enticing, it comes from a wood-burning oven up front, and features highbrow ingredients (speck and sopressata) and lowbrow names (the Cheesus Christ). Still, it’s easy to get distracted by the more sophisticated stuff coming from the back kitchen. The menu changes constantly, but the restaurant’s success means that there are always takers for foie gras (served with rhubarb), coppa di testa (headcheese), a pork chop that doesn’t taste like pork chop, and sea urchin—the theme, Mirarchi said, is “things we like.” On a recent night, the sweetbreads, lightly battered and fried, were like Coney Island popcorn shrimp, served with herbs, honey, and a smear of MitiCrema. Poached duck egg, an oozy bubble balanced on a lump of aged Shelburne cheddar cheese and maitake mushrooms, tasted like the essence of Sunday morning, even though it was a Thursday night. There’s always pasta—orecchiette with salty braised oxtail had a springy texture. Maryland soft-shell crabs, fried with buttermilk and a dab of Wondra flour, were tasty, but they were upstaged by a plate of sugar snap peas—warm, firm, and slightly charred, served with pickled ramps and fermented garlic. </p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">Sunday brunch might be a good time to try the pizza. Several items—pork jowl, hot wings, sticky buns—are comforting, but heavy compared to the dinner food. The upbeat hip-hop and the picnic tables full of wine-drinking patrons contribute to the sense of being at a bleary daytime house party that spills into the yard. Out back, there are signs designating certain areas “staff only,” but it’s hard to tell, among the people milling around, who is staff and who is a paying customer. The bottom line? Do it. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $7-$26.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/04/fishtag	Fishtag	222 W. 79 St. 	null	null	null	2011/07/04	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="131" word_count="131">First, the history: Fishtag used to be Gus &amp; Gabriel (gastropub, 2009), which used to be Kefi (downscale Greek, 2007), which used to be Onera (upscale Greek, 2004), and the chef Michael Psilakis has owned all four. Such a cataloguing might seem cheap, but in a neighborhood not long on good eating—and in a city short on second chances—a local wants some stability. “So it’s basically still a Greek place, right?” asked a hopeful resident one night. Well, no, Fishtag, as the name indicates, is supposed to be a seafood joint. “You won’t find a gyro on the menu,” the hostess replied. But minutes later, the waiter announced, as if delivering a punch line, “The special tonight is a deconstructed gyro.” To be fair, the gyro wasn’t <em>on</em> the menu.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">Every new iteration has brought small modifications to the space. Psilakis has now marbleized and extended the bar area, exposed brick and piping in the dining room, and downloaded some throwbacks onto the soundtrack (Rush, the Police). The food arrives on dishes of wildly divergent sizes, which can seem like psychological warfare—“Why am I the one with the tiny plate?” None of this, though, rivals the confounding layout of the menu, which lists items from lightest to heaviest and color-codes them red for appetizer and black for entrée. Along the margins, orange curly brackets point to recommended wine and liquor pairings. There is a separate, likewise colored, seven-page booklet that itemizes stuff like cheese and charcuterie (and small plates and desserts and tea . . .). The waiter might say, “There’s a lot going on here. Need any assistance?” You might ask for a decoder ring.</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">There is, it turns out, plenty of seafood to go around, much of it not bad. From lightest to heaviest: the scallop crudo with pickled beets and pistachio butter, a gentle little dish; the melted <em>kefalotiri</em> (a Greek cheese) over salted cod, something profoundly better than a tuna melt; the grilled prawn bruschetta, which gets a nice kick from chiles, garlic, and cumin. Dishes like grilled striped bass, roasted salmon, and grilled swordfish are accomplished, if unexciting, renditions. Because, apparently, Psilakis cannot restrain himself, the menu also offers braised rabbit, sheep-milk dumplings, a veal-tongue salad, and a lamb burger. At meal’s end, a card shows up with four check boxes to rate the experience: excellent, very good, good, fair. If Fishtag can do no worse than fair, maybe it’ll stick around for a while.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/27/bell-book-candle	Bell Book & Candle	141 W. 10th St. 	29.788920755102	-95.3982047142857	212-414-2355	2011/06/27	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="174" word_count="174">Realizing the natural conclusion of the locavore movement, Bell Book &amp; Candle, which recently opened in the basement of a West Village apartment building, grows its own vegetables and herbs on the roof. The name itself, taken from the 1958 Jimmy Stewart film, is a challenge (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a few minutes’ walk up Sixth Avenue); the location, in downtown Manhattan and not in the agrarian pastures of Red Hook or Long Island City, is another. As it turns out, perhaps there’s a reason why no one’s gone this local before: the bizarrely retro choice of a Thousand Island dressing on a “living leaf” salad of rooftop greens did little to mask the smoky aftertaste of city exhaust fumes. The halfhearted garnish of shredded carrot and split cherry tomatoes made what should have been the crown jewel of the restaurant’s menu seem more like the free salad at a neighborhood sushi joint. Even the Snickers-size chunk of pork belly atop another bed of greens couldn’t save the vegetables from their <em>terroir</em>.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">Drop the questionable conceit, and there are plenty of dishes on the menu that demonstrate imagination and verve. Soft-shell crab with a hazelnut salad, fried oysters with a green-chile-buttermilk dressing, a gin-and-tonic salmon with a subtle juniper aroma: these were creative combinations not often seen on New York menus. Even the simpler dishes showed care. A burger of ingredients presumably not made in Manhattan was a reminder of favorite burgers from the past. The sandwich bread was reminiscent of a back-yard barbecue, and the accompanying mayonnaise-based spread tasted like the “secret sauce” on a Big Mac—in a good way. Also aggressively un-local: a hearty sausage plate, with a new variety every week, served with an appealing and abundant platter of chopped onion, pickle, and pita.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">Once you’ve abandoned leafy greens altogether, logic dictates that it would be a waste not to order the mini ice-cream sandwiches. The cookies are pliant, leaning toward the Entenmann’s end of the baked-goods spectrum, but they’re wrapped in foil for easy eating, and come with little squeeze bottles of chocolate and caramel sauce. Though the restaurant’s best offerings seem a long way from the initial project, it’s still a treat to find a new place that seems like an old one. With its low ceilings and eclectic furnishings (busts, leather-bound books), Bell Book &amp; Candle feels a little like a cool uncle’s basement. So what if he’s conducting a strange science experiment on the roof? (Open daily for dinner and weekends for brunch. Entrées $12-$28.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/13/ai-fiori	Ai Fiori	400 Fifth Ave., at 36th St. 	null	null	null	2011/06/13	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="100" word_count="100">What is Setai? A kind of satay? A kind of settee? Actually, it’s a hotel brand whose lavish, sleekly bland properties are perhaps a dastardly plot to make the Mandarin Oriental look quirky. Now a Setai has landed incongruously on a scrappy stretch of Fifth Avenue, in a new sixty-story tower by Gwathmey Siegel that is divided between expensive condos (reported to be selling slowly) and expensive hotel rooms. The task of providing a concomitantly expensive restaurant has fallen to Michael White, an Italian-trained chef whose cooking at Marea, Alto, Convivio, and Osteria Morini has made him a star.</p><p data-wc="218" word_count="218">Ai Fiori (“among the flowers”) is said to be loosely inspired by the Ligurian coast, which gives White license to pick and choose from Italian and French culinary traditions. The result is a kind of analog to the Setai’s ethos of contextless luxury. This is a restaurant that has everything—more or less faultless cooking, imaginative plating, exemplary service—except character. A main course of butter-poached lobster, atop a fondant of spring vegetables, is magnificent, firm yet delicate, but it’s a dish you can imagine seeing at any number of high-end places. Still, there are many inventive touches. A slow-poached egg appetizer is a miasma of mildly astringent foam from which little umami kicks emerge in the form of lobster knuckles and veal sweetbreads. Crisp-skinned squab breast, in a dark reduction, seems familiar enough, but nothing prepares you for the tenderness of the squab-leg confit that accompanies it. Lamb <em>en crépinette</em> (wrapped in caul fat with savory leaf) is an innovation too far—dangerously rich and, with its herby, sausagey taste, a little like Thanksgiving stuffing. White, a pasta virtuoso, puts an Italian-style <em>primi</em> course between starters and mains, and portions are generally small enough to reward the detour: a dish of gnocchetti stridently flavored with seafood and saffron is essentially bouillabaisse transmuted into pasta.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">The restaurant is up a spiral staircase just inside the Setai’s entrance. Windows of fritted glass suggest that the establishment wants as little as possible to do with the neighborhood’s garmentos and electronics shops, and sparse attendance at lunch suggests that the neighborhood returns the compliment. Evenings are when the place fills up, with what is pretty clearly an expense-account crowd. (With minestrone soup at twenty-three dollars, they’d better be.) On the way out of the hotel, one of the many black-clad men with Secret Service-style earpieces attempts to turn the revolving door for you. It’s a bizarrely inefficient piece of politesse that leads to a comic tangle of arms and thank-yous and excuse-mes as you head out into the night. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/06/gentleman-farmer	Gentleman Farmer	40 Rivington St. 	40.7210942	-73.9910960567885	212-677-2172	2011/06/06	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="96" word_count="96">The gentleman farmer works for pleasure rather than financial gain; this minuscule French-inflected restaurant on the Lower East Side is serving farm-to-table fare and terroir-driven wines with the same apparent motivation. It’s not much bigger than your first New York apartment, but it’s more thoughtfully decorated; the rustic ceiling made of hundred-and-fifty-year-old oak boards and the copper pots on the walls create homey warmth. From an impossibly tiny kitchen with little more than an electric stovetop, the chef, Karim Nounouh, sends out ambitious preparations of game meats like pheasant, rabbit, venison, and wild boar.</p><p data-wc="231" word_count="231">Those who find tight quarters unforgiving to conversational lulls might do well to start by discussing the unusual cutlery. Laguiole knives, with their distinctive bee on the spring, derive from a farmer’s pocketknife and originate in the South of France. The attenuated blade is ill suited for butter-dish dives but appropriately formal for Nounouh’s tender lobster tail, swimming in sweet beurre blanc. An appetizer of frogs’ legs in a balsamic-cilantro marinade, with a crunchy salad of red cabbage and pistachios, might spark a where-did-you-have-them-last competition (Chinatown or just outside of Lyon?); they also exemplify the sweet-savory theme in Nounouh’s cooking. Balsamic figs accompany sea scallops, carrot-ginger sauce pools beneath rabbit sausage, and a prune confit complements chops of wild boar. The pear purse—a pastry parcel containing honey, cubes of pear, and a balsamic reduction—is rescued from the dessert menu by an oozing glop of sharp Gorgonzola. When the food isn’t this side of cloying, it justifies the absence of salt and pepper on the table. Ostrich steak with peppercorn sauce, prosciutto-wrapped green beans, and an earthy rosemary gratin is the pinnacle of savory eating; beef tenderloin with velvety foie gras and a red-wine reduction is as full-bodied as it is generously portioned. Pheasant pâté with caramelized onions and white-truffle oil reaches the tipping point after a few bites, but that shouldn’t stop you.</p><p data-wc="96" word_count="96">There is only room for twenty, but after a dozen guests have been seated the atmosphere shifts to that of a subway car—diners pretend not to hear one another’s murmurs (“White or red, honey?”), while forgetting that they, too, can be heard (“I’m going for the bunny sausage”). The staff feigns invisibility, but a small jostle brings everything into relief. One evening, a waiter with an armful of plates backed into a light switch, leaving the diners to bask in the glow of their votive candles. (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/30/the-john-dory-oyster-bar	The John Dory Oyster Bar	1196 Broadway, at 29th St. 	null	null	null	2011/05/30	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="82" word_count="82">The British chef April Bloomfield and the restaurateur Ken Friedman, the well-loved team behind the Spotted Pig and the Breslin, have reincarnated their baroque Tenth Avenue seafood restaurant the John Dory (which closed within a year of opening, in 2009) as a more casual annex to the Ace Hotel. Gone are the entrées and the overambition; new are a blasé attitude (high stools, no reservations) and the dispassionate embrace that you find in a place that considers itself the epicenter of cool.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Happy hour is a pleasant affair. Sunlight streams through the ceiling-height windows (even if the view is the wholesale-junk district of Broadway). A half dozen oysters—Naked Cowboys from Long Island or Stellar Bays from British Columbia—and a glass of cava or a Guinness and you’re out just fifteen bucks. At sunset, you might even think the place is quaint, with its mismatched chairs (upholstered variously in palm leaves, Scotch plaid, zebra print, fish print, and green and blue vinyl), fish taxidermy, and more aquatic flummery, including two charming, if large, globe aquariums. But then around 8 <small>P.M.</small>, when it’s dark out and the music is pumped up, the after-work crowd disperses and the hotel scenesters roam in, looking for action.</p><p data-wc="176" word_count="176">It’s hard to find a square meal on the menu of small plates, but that’s not the point here. The crudi are imaginative and impeccable, like the hefty wedges of buttery pink snapper dressed in blood-orange juice, with a chile-pepper kick. Chilled half-lobster, with an unsightly smear of tomalley vinaigrette, gets by on its winning personality (it’s well steamed and satisfying, and it’s lobster, after all). A lovely <em>frika</em> salad with mushrooms, ramps, and mint is a keeper. A modest white bowl holds an exemplary oyster pan roast: three plump, perfect oysters enrobed in cream and vermouth, accompanied by a funky uni crostino. But, on one occasion, more than a few otherwise lovely dishes—anchovy-parsley toast, crab-avocado shots, crab-and-coconut soup, clams and mussels with bone marrow—were bombed with salt. Perhaps the most memorable snack is the most unassuming: the <em>carta di musica</em>, a generous layering of bright-orange <em>bottarga</em> slices, thick pats of butter, and the thinnest of flatbreads, has the chewiness of ginger candy and packs a wallop of oceanic flavor. </p><p data-wc="73" word_count="73">On a warm spring night, one waitress, a ringer for Carol Kane circa “Annie Hall,” made an unusual, Bloomfield-worthy offer. “We have one fish head left. It’s snapper.” Met with stares less skeptical than dumbfounded, she pressed on: “You can eat the cheek, the neck—I had the eyeballs, they were good. You can eat the brain—it’s involved. Some people like it.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dishes $4-$35.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/23/what-happens-when	What Happens When	25 Cleveland Pl. 	40.60302715	-74.0684726420495	212-925-8310	2011/05/23	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="106" word_count="106">The sign in the window of What Happens When—three words in glowing pink neon—could be mistaken for a Bruce Nauman work. The association is fitting, and, one suspects, intentional, considering that the restaurant, which has been widely referred to as a “pop-up” and bills itself as an “installation,” is as much art exhibit as eatery. The concept is a simple stroke of genius, the brainchild of the chef John Fraser, of Dovetail, and a team of artists and designers: set up shop in a space with an expiration date (the building is slated for demolition in November) and live like there’s no tomorrow.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">Themes and prix-fixe menus change every thirty days. In March, as the frost receded, Fraser and company dreamed of a midsummer’s night. Dainty swings, covered with moss and tiny flowers, hung from a forest canopy of green wooden sticks; guests, sipping cocktails with names like Puck and Titania, followed animal tracks on the floor to their tables. The menu was rooted in winter, but never dreary: intensely meaty venison tartare came scattered with gooseberries and flaky homemade saltines, and a smoked egg nested in cloud-smooth chicken liver, ribbons of serrano ham, and puréed butternut squash. After ordering the salt-baked celery root, one diner was treated to a show. An eager server proudly displayed what looked like a science-project volcano in an impressive silver pan: a shell of salt, encasing a knob of celery root, which reappeared shortly in slices atop truffled cream of wheat.</p><p data-wc="167" word_count="167">In April, swooping swaths of khaki-and-salmon-colored fabric, inspired by the awning in Renoir’s “Luncheon of the Boating Party,” evoked the banks of the Seine. Menus were affixed to painters’ palettes, foreshadowing the presentation of the food, each plate a canvas of pastel daubs and swipes. A three-bite amuse-bouche—a thimble of feisty spring-garlic gazpacho, a perfect cube of Swiss-chard omelette, and a spoonful of roe-like lemon-balm gelée—was followed by cod brandade, fried but elegant, propped up against a pile of fava beans and leeks. Like magic, a vermillion-colored broth, poured tableside from a pewter pitcher, transformed a shallow dish of fennel, peppers, and potatoes into a rich bouillabaisse, served with a clove of raw garlic on a cocktail pick, for rubbing on toast. It wasn’t until dessert—delivered charmingly by rolling cart but mostly forgettable—that the spell began to break. Perhaps it was for the best, a necessary transition back into the real world.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/16/lyon	Lyon	118 Greenwich Ave. 	41.7291896839288	-71.4741096603586	212-242-5966	2011/05/16	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="204" word_count="204">Are French waiters more solicitous if they are waiting tables in the States? Perhaps, if only out of cross-cultural necessity. At Lyon, in any case, you quickly detect the staff’s easy hospitality—they touch you on the shoulder, call you <em>Monsieur</em> or <em>Madame</em> in thick accents, and readily help you navigate the menu’s trickier sections. (Also, most of them wear red-and-white gingham dress shirts, and if you happen to wear one as well they don’t make fun of you.) Lyon is subtitled Bouchon Moderne, a <em>bouchon</em> being an unassuming rural tavern offering hearty sustenance to travellers. This one sits on the triangular slice of concrete where Greenwich Avenue cants into Thirteenth Street, in the West Village. By force of circumstance, the bar area, on the northwest side, dead-ends into a nib. Opposite, the dining room stretches into a rectangle that, with its slim center aisle separating oak-panelled booths, has the air of a stately train car—a sensation heightened by the periodic rumble of the subway underfoot. As for <em>moderne</em>, that is left to the chef, Chris Leahy, an apostle of Daniel Boulud and Laurent Tourondel. It is nice to discover that he sends out food as inviting as the atmosphere.</p><p data-wc="225" word_count="225">The signature dish, or, at least, the most popular one, would seem to be the mussels, which come in a black tin bucket with “MOULES” written on the side—there is something gratifying, perhaps primally so, about sucking down bivalves and melted butter and watching the empty shells pile up. Among the starters, asparagus and speck accompany a traditional Lyonnais cheese dip called <em>cervelle de canut</em>, which looks and tastes like tzatziki. It’s creamy and tart and dynamite for spring. More of a provocation is the <em>quenelles de brochet</em>, which turns out to be two jiggly ovoids the texture of flan; you’re told they are made of pike, but what comes through, maybe too pungently, is the surrounding lobster sauce. Though several dishes present opportunities for a diner to exhibit moxie—a beef-tripe entrée, a veal-tongue salad, pig trotters—you shouldn’t feel enfeebled by ordering, say, the roast chicken or the pork chop (both as tender and tasty as they come). Lyon has a sizable bar menu, which includes a hot dog that’s “made in Brooklyn by a French charcutier,” and a cocktail menu of comparable heft. Drink all you want: for weekend breakfast, Leahy serves an egg-bacon-steak-potato concoction that he calls Hangover Recovery Jumbo Brunch Special. (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $19-$45.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/09/m-wells	M. Wells	21-17 49th Ave., Queens 	40.742551	-73.9487227	718-425-6917	2011/05/09	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="186" word_count="186">Much like bungee jumping, skydiving, or Burning Man, eating at M. Wells might, at first, seem like something you’d only want to do once in a lifetime, just to say you did it. The menu at this gussied-up Queens diner reads like a drawn-out dare, and sometimes verges on the grotesque. On a recent evening, there was a special stir-fry of blood sausage and whelks (sea snails), described by the waiter as surf and turf for the hardcore carnivore. There’s a burger so gargantuan that it must be cut into slices, like a pizza; it feeds at least five. It turns out that both items are delicious. The hefty combination of whelks and blood sausage was served with a creamy garlic-dill butter, an umami jolt that was enough to make you forget what you were eating. And the burger—forty ounces of beef and lamb, topped with a teetering column of jumbo onion rings—isn’t just some gimmicky behemoth (though the option of supplementing it with foie gras, for an extra hundred dollars, seems more of a conversation piece than a necessary addition).</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">The chef presiding over all this glorious weirdness is Hugue Dufour, a Quebec native who worked at Montreal’s famed temple of meat Au Pied de Cochon. Dufour came to Long Island City in 2009 to lease an abandoned fifty-seat diner nestled under the train tracks by the Queens-Midtown Tunnel toll plaza. Many of the patrons, particularly during the sleepy midday service, seem to come from the neighborhood, and are encouraged to linger over coffee in a way other “destination” restaurants would find appallingly inefficient. The otherworldliness of the scene serves only to heighten the bizarre juxtapositions on the table. A foie-gras grilled cheese, which came with a punch-bowl-size serving of tomato soup, was so slippery as to demand deconstruction. Crazy as it sounds, the best move might be to off-load a few thick disks of foie gras in order to enjoy the simplicity of melted Gruyère on sourdough unencumbered.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">With a menu this adventurous, there are bound to be missteps. The main thing is that on what might be the city’s least picturesque block there is an old-fashioned diner nonchalantly serving up outrageously ambitious offerings, such as pickled pork tongue, smoky and craveable as the best carnitas, alongside perfectly executed classics, like a biscuit so crumbly and buttery it might as well be a scone. You’ll wish you lived in the neighborhood. (Open Tuesdays through Thursdays for lunch and dinner, Fridays for lunch, and weekends for brunch. Entrées $4-$125.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/02/tortilleria-nixtamal	Tortilleria Nixtamal	104-05 47th Ave., Corona 	40.7459352	-73.859310646707	718-699-2434	2011/05/02	<p data-wc="163" word_count="163">“You can’t get good Mexican food in New York” is a common refrain in this city, and, for the most part, it’s true—you can get Mexican food that isn’t very good, or good food that isn’t very Mexican. Fernando Ruiz and his girlfriend, Shauna Page, are doing something about this problem in a small storefront in Queens, by perfecting the common denominator of any square Mexican meal—the tortilla. Using a process central to the cultures of Mesoamerica, they cook and soak white dent corn in a calcium-hydroxide solution to produce <em>nixtamal</em>, which is ground into starchy, dough-like masa. A Rube Goldbergian machine imported from Mexico spits out additive-free tortillas that, along with masa, are sold wholesale to places like La Esquina and Whole Foods. The rest of the masa is used for tamales, which can be carried out or eaten on the premises, at cheerful red and yellow picnic benches while catching a soccer game on TV. </p><p data-wc="293" word_count="293">The clientele is a mix of local Mexican families who come to stock up and out-of-borough foodies who come to eat and gawk at the low prices. Tacos arrive in orders of three, with a simple garnish of cilantro, onions, and a sliver of lime. The menu is literal: “pork” means just pork, with no added sauce or marinade. The intense, aromatic corn brings a powerful flavor to every dish. Guacamole is practically an afterthought, hidden under thick, unsalted chips freshly fried in corn oil. Tamales are substantive and delightfully savory; those with pork and chicken in a chipotle sauce are perfectly smoky and spicy, and those with roasted chiles, cheese, and tomatoes are an equally satisfying vegetarian treat. The Italiano is an unusual homage to the original denizens of the neighborhood, containing sausage, peppers, and fresh mozzarella from Franco’s Meat and Deli around the corner. Pozole, a brothy soup made with fluffy hominy and shreds of pork, comes with an assortment of onions, radishes, cabbage, and dried oregano for individually tailored seasoning. Enchiladas <em>en mole</em> are essentially chicken tacos drowned in poblano-chile sauce, a complex sweet-spicy dressing made from twenty ingredients. One of the only things on the menu that isn’t made with corn is the Mexican bottled Coca-Cola, which is still manufactured with cane sugar—purists claim it has a cleaner, sweeter flavor than the stuff made with high-fructose corn syrup (killjoys claim you’re dead either way). The subway ride back to Manhattan gives you time to wonder just what Paul Simon meant when he sang “goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona,” and the food is cheap enough to leave you an extra dollar for the mariachi band.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/25/porsena	Porsena	21 E. 7th St. 	37.8079591	-122.3055973	212-228-4923	2011/04/25	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="137" word_count="137">Upon entering Porsena, a new restaurant from the chef Sara Jenkins (50 Carmine, Porchetta), you might notice a bowl of oranges sitting on the host stand and a vase of uncooked spaghetti on the end of the bar. At first, these seem borrowed from a red-sauce joint in the suburbs or a tourist trap in Rome. The whitewashed brick walls, hung with stock photos of Italy, don’t help. But later, after you’ve worked your way through bread, appetizers, <em>primi</em>, and <em>secondi</em> and are waiting for dessert, you might look over to a neighboring table and see diners of a more judicious, trimmer nature peel and share a single, perfect orange. What seemed like unimaginative design reveals itself to be a practical, elegant touch. You begin to wonder if the potted-herb centerpieces are for seasoning your food. </p><p data-wc="177" word_count="177">Which is not to say the food needs seasoning. As Jenkins proved with Porchetta, the roast-pork shop she opened down the street in 2008, she knows what she’s doing in the kitchen. Here she’s traded pig for pasta—but to jump straight to starch would be a mistake. First, there are mussels, steamed with saffron, garlic, and chile flakes, silky enough to make you wonder if you’ve been eating them overcooked your whole life; a salad of barely wilted escarole and crisp croutons in an anchovy dressing; and whipped <em>baccalà</em>, baked to a golden, buttery finish. Then to the <em>pennette</em>, the spaghetti, the <em>maccheroncini</em>, the lasagna. The latter is a rare miss, layered with noodles too thin to hold up to the <em>ragù</em> and <em>besciamel</em> between them. <em>Anneloni</em> with creamy, spicy lamb sausage and mustard greens, though, might leave you lusting after it the next day, and a recent special of <em>nodi marini</em>, or “sailor’s knots,” jewelled with seared chicken livers and heady with rosemary and thyme, tastes like it could cure a cold. </p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">The entrées are few, listed demurely at the bottom of the menu. It comes as something of a shock, then, when their arrival is preceded by delivery of steak knives so formidable they warrant an admonition: “Don’t fight with these, guys.” They’re not just for show—both the pork chop, a juicy medium atop cannellini beans and a lemony red-cabbage slaw, and the red-wine-braised beef shin, served with marrow and polenta, are enormous. If you can manage dessert, try the lemon-olive-oil cake or the excellent cheese plate, accompanied, in season, by a bowl of clementines. If you can’t, don’t worry: there are oranges.

The result, six months in, has a whiff of theme-park elegant. There’s a proficient team ready to serve the friendliest top-of-the-line Italian food this side of Fifty-ninth Street—with prices to match. The experience may begin, when you call for reservations, with a solicitous prerecorded message that includes English translations of <em>primi</em> and <em>secondi</em>, as if hedging against surprise were part of the whole grand package. When you get there, if you approach from Hearst Plaza, you will be treated to a vision of greatness. The roof—a sloping, grass-covered paraboloid called the Illumination Lawn—overlooks a reflecting pool adorned with a Henry Moore sculpture. Once inside the vast, pristine space, all futuristic glass walls and veneer angles, you can’t really see the grass or the pool, but there are views of the rear draperies of Avery Fisher Hall, the traffic on Sixty-fifth Street, or the kitchen. Pick the kitchen.</p><p data-wc="180" word_count="180">The menu, which changes daily, tends toward Italian classics gently tweaked. When asked, “Should I get Prosecco in my build-your-own negroni?,” the waitress, with her no-nonsense pants suit and dry sense of humor, replied, “I can’t believe we even offer that.” Mozzarella in Carrozza (cheese in a carriage) turned out to be no more than a hockey-puck-shaped disk of breaded fried cheese over puttanesca sauce. But a velvety green-garlic-and-broccoli purée with ricotta gnudi was ethereal, and the complimentary focaccia with rosemary, salt, and lardo should be sold by the bagful. Pastas are hit or miss. Gnocchi, though accompanied by a humdrum tomato sauce, was perfectly pillowy. Tortelli di Zucca did amazing things for kabocha squash, combining it with hazelnuts, amaretti, and brown butter—fantastic, if you like dessert for your <em>primi</em>. Linguini with sea urchin and crab, which sounded so good, was sadly overpowered by salt and scallions. The <em>carne</em> can be beautiful. Short ribs braised in red wine were meltingly tender; slow-roasted pork loin was juicy, if a bit bland, even when dressed with balsamic and guanciale.</p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">If there’s still time before the show, have the gelato—the subtle honey <em>fiore di latte</em> that accompanied a mediocre hazelnut-chocolate-and-mascarpone torta was sublime. It was a Friday at 7:53 <small>P.M</small>., and the place was clearing out. A stoic bartender remarked, “This is the weirdest restaurant I’ve ever worked at. You encourage people to come sit at the bar at eight—you wouldn’t do that at Babbo.” Maybe not, but you also wouldn’t be a minute away from the Met.

Merkato 55, a pan-African attempt a few years back, was a faltering accumulation of gestures, which seemed like a publicist’s idea of what a Samuelsson restaurant should be. On the face of it, Red Rooster, serving moderately upscale home-style cooking to gentrifying Harlem, might seem like a publicist’s idea, too: who better to express the neighborhood’s mixed heritage?</p><p data-wc="176" word_count="176">Yet Red Rooster has the unfakable atmosphere of a place that is comfortable with itself. Staff and diners alike seem happy to be there, and Samuelsson and his executive chef, Andrea Bergquist, have effortlessly integrated fusion elements spanning fried chicken, spongy Ethiopian injera bread, and Swedish meatballs. An inventive appetizer called Chicken &amp; Egg gives a sense of the range: a rectangular skillet lined with injera and loaded with heavily spiced pulled chicken is topped with a gently poached egg, mango chutney beaded with chunks of cottage cheese, and chicken liver seared so lightly as to be jellylike. Blackened catfish atop black-eyed peas is heavily spiced, too—dry-seared in paprika, onion, and cayenne—and achieves an almost tandoori taste. Approaching a classic like fried chicken, the chefs don’t feel the need to overdo the batter, and content themselves with adding spicy mustard greens to the collards underneath. Flavors are on the sweet side: pickles are sweet, cocktails sweeter, and a bar snack of pulled pork with “rainbow slaw” suggests a combination of main course and dessert.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The restaurant is divided in two—hoop-shaped bar in front, dining room behind—and the décor splits the difference between sleek and friendly. The place is always thronged, waits for tables are long, and there is a danger of being relegated to a rather drab room (shortly to become a lounge) downstairs. A good tactic is to stand at the bar, colonize stools as they become available, and eat there. It’s the best vantage for getting a feel of the unforced ebullience, and of the lively backchat between regulars and staff, one of whom gamely sports a roosterlike Mohawk.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/04/edi-the-wolf	Edi & the Wolf	102 Ave. C, at 7th St. 	null	null	null	2011/04/04	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="191" word_count="191">At this new Austrian tavern, wedged into an increasingly companionable stretch of Alphabet City, “Edi” is pronounced “Eddie” and “the Wolf” does not refer to Harvey Keitel’s character in “Pulp Fiction.” These are the nicknames of the co-owners, Eduard Frauneder and Wolfgang Ban, a pair of Austrian émigrés who also run the graceful Seäsonal, on Fifty-eighth Street, of which Edi &amp; the Wolf is the downtown, down-market iteration. This is but the first of many linguistic challenges that await. Edi and the Wolf say their latest spot was inspired by Austria’s <em>Heurigen</em> (wine gardens), and they tried to imbue it with gemütlichkeit (a spirit of coziness). Cozy, yes; gardens, no. From the sidewalk, Edi &amp; the Wolf resembles a forsaken industrial garage. The inside holds what appears to be the hoard of an exuberant and undiscerning band of freegans: old wooden chairs affixed to the walls at curious angles, worn leather boots filled with dead flowers, a forty-foot rope salvaged from a Bed-Stuy belfry strung like crêpe paper above the bar. Yet little lights installed in the cracks of the ceiling lend the chaos an ethereal glow.</p><p data-wc="231" word_count="231">It can help, when facing a night of <em>Blaufränkisch</em> and <em>Schokolade Nuss Palatschinken</em>, to bring along an authority. On short notice, only a man from southern Germany who professed to a “branch of cousins who are all barbers in the Austrian Alps” could be procured. (But, he explained, “Germans claim everything else that’s Austrian—the music, the art work. Why shouldn’t we claim the food, too?”) Edi, who runs the floor, pushes the wine list, but the German authority argues, “If I’m going to be in Austria, I’m going to have a beer,” and orders a Lammsbräu Dark. Soon after, he deems the <em>Landjäger</em>—cured Austrian sausage, long and skinny like a Slim Jim—as juicy and smoky as any his cousins can proffer. The spätzle is too creamy to be authentic; it’s “<em>etepetete</em>” (translation: “fancy-pants”). As a fine Wiener schnitzel goes down quietly, the table agrees that <em>Schlutzkrapfen</em>, an indulgent cheese ravioli, has been unfairly encumbered with one of Mitteleuropa’s least appetizing names. There is a steak with fried peppers and a sea bass with squash and sunchokes, both good, if tilting toward American supper club. Instead of a second bite of a too-dry Linzer torte, with a distressing lack of jam, the authority raises a finger and says, “Another Lammsbräu, please.” (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/28/kin-shop	Kin Shop	469 Sixth Ave., at 11th St. 	null	null	null	2011/03/28	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="99" word_count="99">For a man known to millions as the season-one winner of “Top Chef,” Harold Dieterle keeps a low profile. His first restaurant, Perilla, opened in 2007 on a West Village side street and has quietly earned its stripes as a neighborhood staple. His new, Thai-inspired Kin Shop is a few blocks away, on an undistinguished stretch of Sixth Avenue. With its whitewashed brick walls and algae-colored décor, the narrow space might be mistaken for an upscale nail salon, were it not for the open kitchen—and the throng of foodies, scene-makers, and locals who pack the place every night.</p><p data-wc="235" word_count="235">On a recent Tuesday evening, a short wait earned one table a complimentary starter of sweet grilled prawns, served with halved limes and a little pitcher of black-pepper dipping sauce. The restaurateur Joe Bastianich was holding court in a corner; nearby, two couples of a certain age had ignored their waiter’s advice to go “family style” and were polishing off four identical platters of the fried-pork-and-crispy-oyster salad. Fair enough, the dish is addictive: fatty, salty, and crunchy with a sweet kick of chili-lime vinaigrette, garnished with leaves of baby celery and mint. If you’re craving pad thai, crave it elsewhere. Dieterle’s menu, augmented by daily specials (roasted bone marrow, whole porgie), steers clear of predictability. Instead of the ubiquitous tom yum, he serves squid-ink-and-hot-sesame-oil soup. It looks like a by-product of the BP disaster but tastes like a surf-and-turf fantasy thanks to nuggets of brisket-stuffed squid. Asterisks denote heat level, with four stars reserved for just two items: a fiery “jungle” curry with bamboo shoots and a blisteringly scrumptious duck <em>laab</em>. When the waiter delivered the latter—three hearts of romaine filled with minced meat and toasted rice, topped with thin rings of pickled red onion—he reassured a spice-wary diner, “I’m here if you need me.” Don’t worry, you won’t. The dish unfolds in waves of sweet, tart, and savory; when the heat hits, the harmony is complete.</p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">Not everything wows. A <em>massaman</em> curry of goat, braised with purple yams, mustard greens, and a sprinkle of coconut, is unremarkable, though the meat is “as tender as Grandmother’s brisket” by one estimation. Curries are better sopped up by a side order of jasmine rice than by the roti (billed as “crispy,” the rounds of bread arrived soggy with grease on two separate occasions). As for dessert, it’s an off-menu afterthought: it was kaffir-lime or galangal ice cream one night. Skip the scoop and kick back with a caramel-nut lager from Laos—or a house cocktail, like the Phuket Fizz, made of vodka, Thai basil, and fresh pineapple, as low key a pleasure as Kin Shop itself.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/21/seersucker	Seersucker	329 Smith St., Brooklyn 	40.68059965	-73.9943779671784	718-422-0444	2011/03/21	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="148" word_count="148"> Seersucker has all the trappings of a trendy Brooklyn eatery: mason jars, no reservations, and a menu centered on Southern fare—fried chicken, pickles, pimento cheese. The chef, Robert Newton, is from Arkansas by way of Tabla and Le Cirque, and his girlfriend and co-owner, Kerry Diamond, is a native New Yorker. She was a radio d.j. in college in the late eighties, so the bathroom is decorated with album covers from Southern rock bands like Big Star, R.E.M., and Let’s Active, but the playlist ranges from the Beatles to LCD Soundsystem, hitting the obvious Feist songs along the way. The restaurant’s Web site says that Seersucker is “inspired” by all things Southern, a claim that conveniently exempts the food from measuring up to any ideals. The hospitality, however, is the genuine article: it puts Southerners at ease and makes New Yorkers nervous.</p><p data-wc="187" word_count="187">Several entrées come underseasoned, perhaps so as not to offend. Devilled eggs, named for a traditional dusting of paprika, bear neither the red powder nor its kick, and an order of two spongy biscuits comes with a selection of bland preserves and honey butter, which tastes as though someone had, days ago, carelessly swiped a honey-mottled knife across a pot of butter. A Tuesday-evening special of fried chicken holds the promise of spice, but it requires getting to the Carroll Street F stop well before 8 <small>P.M.</small> Much of the rest of the menu leaves you with the distinct sense of having been fleeced. A perfectly cooked pork chop the size of a large dinner plate seems a bargain at twenty-two dollars based on weight alone, but there is no flavor to be found in it or under it, in a bed of spaetzle. One evening, a fifteen-dollar Black Angus burger came on an ordinary picnic bun, and one gentleman’s nineteen-dollar dish of chicken and dumplings so resembled chicken potpie that he pined for puff pastry and wondered, “Shouldn’t comfort food be more comforting?”</p><p data-wc="140" word_count="140">There are bright spots on the brunch menu, including a peppery sausage gravy and a well-balanced pork hash. But collard greens and grits suffer an insipid fate, despite being studded with ham and Cheddar cheese, respectively. The coffee is sourced from Counter Culture, a Durham-based company that provided the staff with a “coffee education program,” which at least gave a waitress something to discuss as she begged pardon for her failed attempt at a latte leaf one Sunday morning. At each turn, something is off, exposing that this is merely a New York couple’s idea of a Southern restaurant. The only excuse for it, and for the servers’ double-denim uniforms, is that all the cool kids are doing it. (Open Mondays through Fridays for breakfast and lunch, Mondays through Saturdays for dinner, and weekends for brunch. Entrées $15-$23.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/14/bab-al-yemen	Bab Al Yemen	413 Bay Ridge Ave., Brooklyn 	40.63457465	-74.0229222543991	718-943-6961	2011/03/14	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="144" word_count="144">The Romans called Yemen “Arabia Felix,” or Happy Arabia, after its relative hospitability. While few would now consider Yemen, for all its wonders and charms, uncommonly welcoming (or contented, to go by recent events), you can still get a taste of its enduring felicity at this little storefront in Bay Ridge. Named after a famous gate in Sana’a, the capital, Bab al Yemen has an open area of tables in front and a row of curtained booths off the corridor to the kitchen, for anyone inclined toward privacy or female invisibility. You might notice Bab al Yemen’s authenticity before you absorb its warmth, especially if you’ve just stopped at the corner liquor store, thinking, erroneously, of B.Y.O.B., rather than N.F.W. You must go without your trusty astringent as you devour the better part of a sheep. </p><p data-wc="312" word_count="312">The felicity comes, first, in the person of Waleed al Jahmi, the owner, who offers cheerful elucidations on the menu and updates on his health-code-testing attempts to build an outdoor wood oven, for the purpose of properly roasting a lamb. Then come the concoctions of his brother, Abdulghani, the chef, who previously worked in the kitchen at L’Impero. The Yemenis, you might say, bring more to the table than do their Arabian cousins—chalk it up to Yemen’s historical position as a spice-world hub and its proximity to the Horn of Africa. And so you get a beguiling challenge like <em>saltah</em>, a lamb-and-root-vegetable stew bubbling in an earthen pot, with a floater of whipped fenugreek. You can wipe the pot clean with <em>khobz</em>, the hubcaps of pocked clay-oven bread that accompany everything and insure that you will run out of room before you run out of curiosity. Bab al Yemen’s greatest hit is <em>haneeth</em>, various cuts of slow-roasted lamb that falls off the bone, but, on a recent evening, this was perhaps outshone by a special of diced lamb over white rice called <em>kabsah</em>, the gamiest of the flock. (There are many chicken, fish, and bean things on the menu, but when in Sana’a . . .) The meal’s bookends can be muscular, too: from the soup that invariably starts it off, a lamb-marrow consommé called <em>marag</em>, to <em>sabaya</em>, a traditional dessert consisting of fifty layers of baked dough, each separated by a coat of clarified butter. You have to order that one well in advance. (The twenty-five-layer version takes twenty minutes.) Even if you don’t, you may find yourself at meal’s end to be an embodiment of what Sir Richard Francis Burton, in his translation of the slippery Arabic term <em>kayf</em>, called “the savoring of animal existence.” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/07/riverpark	Riverpark	450 E. 29th St. 	29.8130002887741	-95.3940815605454	212-729-9790	2011/03/07	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="140" word_count="140">There’s no disputing that Riverpark, Tom Colicchio’s newest restaurant, is in an odd location. First you need to convince your taxi-driver that the address, east of First Avenue, actually exists. Then you’ll enjoy an extended tour of Kips Bay, a neighborhood best known for its sparsely populated movie theatre, before finally arriving at a biotech science park lit like a college campus and dotted with security guards. This pedestrian-only block, buffered by the frozen expanse of the East River, must surely be the safest in New York—and that turns out to be appropriate, because the food at Riverpark is similarly devoid of risk. But while the repertoire of comfort-food classics won’t throw you any curveballs, the dining experience is executed with admirably consistent muted professionalism, as though McKinsey consultants had built the place from scratch. </p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">Because nothing on the menu seems particularly exciting, it’s hard to know what to order, but recommendations from the uniformly helpful waitstaff never fail. A dangerously nineties-sounding appetizer of hamachi sashimi with a pomegranate vinaigrette turned out to be sublimely balanced, the acidity and sweetness of the dressing complementing, not overwhelming, the fish. A pork chop described enthusiastically by the waiter as “tasting like bacon” came out juicier than the pears surrounding it. A sweet-potato ravioli he said was his favorite was garnished with blood oranges, imbuing a dish that in the wrong hands can end up claggy and insipid with a quirky sophistication. Roasted mushrooms, billed as a “must-have,” came unadorned in a pile on the plate, but were charred, chewy, and addictive. Veer from the script, however, and the results are mixed. Goose tortelloni, which sounded intriguing, swam in a red-wine sauce that unfortunately evoked spring-break sangria. The “kale chutney” served with diver scallops was gritty and tasteless.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">For a restaurant that does the basics brilliantly, dessert is, of course, flawless. The rummiest, most raisin-filled ice cream, made in-house, has the stretchy, elastic consistency of freshly pulled mozzarella. There is an ingenious beer ice cream, made with the clove-y Bavarian Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel, and beignets are like the Platonic ideal of childhood carnival-truck zeppole. Leaving the restaurant—through the office-lobby turnstiles, out the sliding automatic doors, into the freezing wind coming off the river—is a bit of an ordeal. But there’s one final, delightful, befitting surprise: the maître d’, observing your leave-taking, has already called you a cab. (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and daily for dinner. Entrées $24-$29.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/28/hung-ry	Hung Ry	55 Bond St. 	-33.731401	150.7861116	212-677-4864	2011/02/28	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="166" word_count="166">If you like your macaroni and cheese drizzled with truffle oil, your French fries fried in duck fat, and foie gras in your <em>banh mi</em>, you might make a beeline for Hung Ry, an instantly popular new restaurant that contrives to elevate hand-pulled-noodle soup from a Chinatown staple to NoHo haute cuisine. The concept pervades: grabby name (a feeble play on words), “reclaimed” wood (one wall is papered in raw birch bark, reclaimed, presumably, from a tree), Limoges flatware, a soundtrack that could only be classified as world lounge. Servers, dressed smartly in black, are quick to pour water from clamp-stopped glass bottles and apologetic when appetizers take an hour to materialize. Luckily, they’re worth the wait: lightly battered squid tossed with chopped mint and pumpkin seeds atop a smear of <em>guajillo</em> paste; braised short ribs garnished with melon balls, their sweetness giving way to the round and satisfying kick of daikon foam; a colorful plate of roasted beets, pickled radishes, and tiny, pear-shaped carrots.</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">At the back of the room, a chef in clean whites stands in the L-shaped open kitchen, stretching dough into a long cord and swinging it like a jump rope as he crafts, to order, spaghetti-like noodles, which are bathed in soups featuring unlikely combinations of “natural” local ingredients. Gamy goat shank and al-dente wax beans pair surprisingly well, and the decadent duo of pork tongue and smoked pork belly is nicely balanced by crisp Brussels sprouts. Oxtail, beef cheek, turnip, and black currants, on the other hand, make a literal hot mess, with a broth so concentrated and oily it’s nearly inedible, and duck breast is overpowered by sweet peppers.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">It’s hard to argue with the noodles themselves—the experts who pull them were recruited from Chinatown classifieds, and the only difference is that here the flour is organic. But while in Chinatown they feel venerated—served sparingly in, say, broth bobbing with pork-filled Fujianese fish balls and a handful of fresh spinach leaves—in Hung Ry’s overwrought concoctions they seem beside the point. If you like the sort of meal that ends with vegan chocolate-coconut ice cream, you’ve come to the right place—Hung Ry’s is quite good. If you like hand-pulled noodles, as much for their simplicity as for their artistry, you’d do best to stay south of Canal. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/14/annisa	Annisa	13 Barrow St. 	53.4826823	-2.2635015	212-741-6699	2011/02/14	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="173" word_count="173">“Top Chef Masters,” first season, fourth episode: Anita Lo trumped her adversaries by unerringly cooking an egg with one hand tied behind her back. Not bad, as far as covetable displays of skill go. The feat was also a rebuke to the bad luck that had come Lo’s way. In previous years, both of her restaurants, Bar Q and Annisa, suffered fire damage. So when Lo, a first-generation Chinese-American and a self-professed woman of reason, decided to rebuild Annisa, last winter, she hired Kismet Feng Shui, a Norwalk-based consultancy, to secure its karma. After the firm considered Lo’s zodiac sign and Annisa’s geographic coördinates, it wrote a prescription: “You will need two Wu Luo, golden gourds”; “Place a citrine and a sardonyx crystal in the cash drawer”; and “Place six Chinese metal luck coins on either side of stairs.” Lo declined a fish tank (“water cools things”), but she did embed six obsidian arrowheads in the concrete around a basement drain, to “prevent bad energy emerging from the pipe.”</p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">It seems best not to quibble with results: no fires, packed house. Besides, to the unsuspecting, Annisa’s elegance isn’t persnickety. The dining room, small but not cramped, has thirteen tables (a not unlucky number in feng-shui) on a raised, stagelike platform. Sitting up there, you feel like an honoree, a sensation only enhanced if you happen to get a two-top where you and your date sit next to, not across from, each other—it’s a happy invitation to gaze upon and discreetly gossip about the crowd. At regular intervals, a semi-transparent section of a rear wall slides open, and out come Lo’s ornate, succulent creations, sparked by her blended heritage.</p><p data-wc="147" word_count="147">An amuse-bouche of unexpected complexity—for instance, mini escargot tarts strewn with Parmesan—is Lo’s gateway drug, and the grand meal that follows is progressively, and agreeably, addictive. Spanish-mackerel crudo with blood orange, mustard seed, and broccoli rabe leads to braised boar belly with apple, unagi, and daikon. What the menu calls simply duck with “three herbs” (cilantro, Thai basil, and lemon balm) turns out to be duck three ways: a delicate rillette garnished with slivers of papaya; a pho-style soup stippled with rice cakes; and flawlessly grilled rectangles of meat. Juicy veal tenderloin is not overwhelmed by its chaperon of sweetbreads and a sauce of artichokes, oysters, and black truffles. Lo pulls double duty as Annisa’s pastry chef. One dessert sets an almond-milk jelly afloat in a pink-grapefruit soup. Though red like fire, it cools like water. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $28-$36.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

There is a Japanese phrase, “<em>Ichigensama okotowari</em>,” that’s used by owners of certain discriminating restaurants and shops, and means, roughly, “We respectfully decline first-time visitors.” In other words: walk-ins not welcome. To make a reservation or a purchase, you have to be recommended by a regular. It is this spirit, theoretically, that governs Bohemian, a Japanese-owned restaurant in NoHo. The phone number is not listed—the owners have another restaurant, in the Nishiazabu district of Tokyo, which flies similarly under the radar—and its Web site advises, “Please be referred by someone who has already visited us.” Pretty intimidating. In reality, though, the restaurant’s phone number surfaces with determined Googling, and you can get a table with only a little bit of vetting. The other night, someone answered the phone by asking, “Um, how did you get this number?” “A friend gave it to me.” (Pause.) “O.K. Good.”</p><p data-wc="175" word_count="175">Bohemian is, naturally, hard to find—it’s a <em>kakurega</em>, or hidden place, tucked behind a Japanese butcher shop, in a building once owned by Andy Warhol. Inside, the atmosphere is minimalist but cozy: sixties-style lounge chairs, an illuminated wooden bar, a Zen garden, bongos. The clientele—“Bohemians of the 21st century,” according to the Web site—seem to be a mixture of Japanese transplants, local loft dwellers, and facial-hair-wearing Europeans. The menu is idiosyncratic; Japanese treats alternate with French and American comfort food. An appetizer of vegetable “fondue” consists of baby carrots and radishes, stuck, Mr. Potato Head-style, into a mound of bar ice, with a side of anchovy dipping sauce. Uni comes served on fried croquettes, stuffed with a gooey (in a good way) mushroom filling. The cold and briny oysters are delicious, as is beef sashimi from the butcher shop out front, sprinkled with lime juice. But the entrées—crispy-skinned chicken with mashed potatoes, pan-roasted branzini with baby Brussels sprouts, a quality burger, a skippable risotto—are not exactly destination food. </p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Probably the best thing at Bohemian is the drink menu: the Mint Gold, a kind of mint julep made with fresh mint, lime, ginger, cardamom, and red pepper, is not too sweet, and neither is the gin and tonic. Dessert—light and eggy sake panna cotta, silky flan—is like elegant baby food, served with wooden spoons. You’re likely to end up slumped in your lounge chair, gazing at the bongos. “Do you want to play them?” a waiter asks. Once you’re in, you’re in. (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/31/rubirosa	Rubirosa	235 Mulberry St. 	35.7975726072596	-78.6343131782213	212-965-0500	2011/01/31	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="221" word_count="221">A waiter, sporting a jaunty fedora, attempted to explain the restaurant’s name. “Rubirosa? He was from Europe. Italy, I think. I heard he was this man who used to be a playboy and he had sex with everyone, and then he became a librarian.” After checking with the bartender on the facts, he returned. “He was Dominican! He was some badass cool playboy. And this pepper grinder was named after him”—he pulled out a wooden two-footer. “You can imagine why.” Indeed. Porfirio Rubirosa, the infamous midcentury rake and rumored assassin who, when asked about his line of work, claimed that women were his “full-time job,” counted among his conquests Doris Duke (one of the world’s richest women at the time) and Marilyn Monroe. Rubirosa was also reportedly one of Ian Fleming’s inspirations for James Bond. What that has to do with this new Italian-American red-sauce-and-pizza joint in Nolita is hard to tell. The chef and co-owner, Angelo Pappalardo (who has cooked at Esca), has returned to his pizza-making roots to open the homey neighborhood spot with his father, Giuseppe, owner of the Staten Island institution Joe &amp; Pat’s. With gorgeous pressed-tin ceilings, a quaint, nook-filled floor plan, and framed pictures evoking immigrant passages to the New World, Rubirosa is rather conspicuously lower on glamour than its namesake.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">The menu sticks to the basics. Antipasti run the usual gamut of calamari, baked clams, and mozzarella sticks. The roasted octopus is a nice touch, redolent of Venice with potatoes, celery, radicchio, and lemon. Bruschetta skews upscale, and it’s good: toppings include fresh, light poached shrimp scampi with jalapeño and sweet braised duck with caramelized onion. The fact that Rubirosa has a salumi plate—a raging trend right now—seems more like a coincidence than a strategy; the prosciutto, speck, and Pecorino Romano might as well be first-rate ingredients that they happened to have lying around the kitchen. The homemade pastas can be on the heavy side but are still delicious; the hand-rolled manicotti is heavenly mushy goodness, stuffed with mozzarella and “imported” ricotta.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">But what about the pies? It’s gutsy to open a pizza place just steps from Lombardi’s. Rubirosa’s version, made using Joe &amp; Pat’s fifty-year-old recipe, is offered with a choice of sauces: classic tomato or kicky vodka. The ultra-thin crust manages to be chewy on the inside and crispy on the bottom, with slightly charred, crunchy edges. It’s so thin and so good, you can eat a lot of it before realizing that you were full a while ago. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $18-$26.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/24/takashi	Takashi	456 Hudson St. 	42.3561888	-83.0837728	212-414-2929	2011/01/24	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="136" word_count="136">It is an increasingly common practice for diners to look up obscure menu items on their smartphones, but at Takashi, a self-proclaimed “meat mecca” that serves only beef, phones can remain pocketed—two walls of the place are covered with an encyclopedic crib sheet on <em>yakiniku</em>, or Japanese barbecue. The mural includes concise descriptions and cute illustrations of various cuts of meat and <em>horumon</em> (literally, “discarded goods,” or offal), along with notes on their vitamin content and supposed health benefits. Chef Takashi Inoue, a Japanese immigrant of Korean descent, works behind the counter, liberating pleasing rectilinear shapes from boulders of beef, which are fashionably sourced from purveyors like Dickson’s and Pat LaFrieda. With the yellow cattle-crossing sign and the curtain emblazoned with the kanji character for “meat,” there’s no mistaking what’s for dinner.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">Customers pick through complimentary plates of mild, addictive kimchi and raw cabbage dressed with miso as they decide how daring they should be. The chuck-eye tartare, a suggested dish for first-timers, is an excellent showcase for the high-quality beef, but you don’t go to Osaka to order a Continental specialty. The game-faced can try the fresh, slippery liver (reminiscent of sashimi) or the curiously crunchy and spicy flash-boiled Achilles tendon (whose texture and hypnotic power are comparable to bubble wrap). More experienced palates will not be fazed by the <em>niku-natto</em>, minced chuck eye with pungent fermented soybeans, which leaves trails of gooey, sticky strings when pulled apart. The same population is probably already familiar with the Toto Washlet in the rest room, and will return to the table with complete composure.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">After the appetizers, a black exhaust hood is lowered, and a tabletop electric grill is switched on. Metal tongs are used to flip marbled short ribs and slices of cheek and tongue, and—for those emboldened by sake or the yeasty Hitachino Red Rice Ale—chewy chunks of <em>mino</em> and <em>akasen</em>, also known as first and fourth stomach. On a recent visit, a server advised on the two seasoning options: salt, garlic, and sesame oil or Takashi’s foolproof signature soy-based marinade. Cooking times were cheerfully suggested, depending on one’s preference for milky or caramelized sweetbreads, at which point one gentleman produced a smartphone with a stopwatch function. There was a clash of chopsticks as he asked the young woman at his side, “Are you trying to overcook my heart?” (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $12-$28.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/17/millesime	Millesime	92 Madison Ave., at 29th St. 	null	null	null	2011/01/17	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="158" word_count="158">It’s not easy to be a hotel restaurant. Too adventurous and you drive away the hotel guests; too predictable and you become a mere canteen for people who can’t be bothered to go out. Laurent Manrique’s new venture, in a David Rockwell-designed two-story space in the Carlton Hotel (formerly occupied by Country), has a variety of schemes for attending to the needs of the hotel while also pulling in outside traffic. On the ground floor is Salon Millesime, a cocktail lounge centered on a grand piano, which bills itself as a “nostalgic portal” to the Tin Pan Alley era. Above is Millesime itself, which specializes in seafood cooked in the classic French style. The dual preoccupations of the restaurant are announced by very French-looking red banquettes and Eiffel Tower-shaped salt and pepper shakers and by the fact that the waiters wear yellow fishermen’s aprons, as if they’ve just gutted the day’s catch.</p><p data-wc="195" word_count="195">The cooking is conservative (<em>millésime</em> is French for “vintage”) but consummate, and the food is competitively priced, given its quality. Appetizers include an extensive raw bar, fish tartares, and French specialties such as pike quenelles in a rich lobster sauce (light and fluffy, they quiver, jellylike, when placed on the table). Main courses feature five kinds of fish—salmon, cod, black sea bass, snapper, and tuna—with a choice of five sauces served on the side. There’s something endearingly unfashionable about this—not only the sauces themselves, creamy and unapologetically French, but also the idea, at a time when chefs tend to micromanage the dining experience, that any sauce can be tipped over any fish. Still, there’s a lot to be said for recognizing that one person may just prefer the lemon mousseline (incredibly frothy and sweet, almost dessertlike) while another may fancy the <em>sauce vierge </em>(a tangier mixture of olives, tomato, garlic, and basil). The food here is short on innovation for innovation’s sake—one exception is a North African twist on tuna tartare, with lemon oil, date marmalade, almonds, harissa, mint, and cumin—but it is all perfectly prepared. </p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">The piano downstairs is raised on a dais, lid permanently up, but it doesn’t get played much. Instead, a d.j. spins loudly, or a band sets up, seemingly always on the verge of launching into a set. One evening shortly before Christmas, an eerie French woman, dressed in luminous white and wearing what looked like a sequinned shower cap on her head, floated around the room like a spectre, playing a transparent accordion and softly singing an eclectic program that started with Montmartre-esque ballads and then moved on, by way of the Habanera from “Carmen,” to “Greensleeves.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

The front of the vest-pocket space—a hybrid bodega, lunch counter, and raw bar—is stocked with groceries that pair Stulman’s Wisconsin roots (Life cereal, Premium saltines, Hellmann’s mayonnaise) with his locavore leanings (Satur Farms heirloom cherry tomatoes, Anarchy in a Jar grapefruit-and-smoked-salt preserves). In the mornings, mothers with children and scooters in tow line up behind subway-bound suits for dollar cups of Stumptown coffee—no lattes here, only drip.</p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">In the back, with a mere two dozen seats at the bar and around one communal table, the joint tends to be jumping. “Can I ask you guys to slide down one?” a host inquired on a recent Sunday. “I’m trying to seat three and it’s a chess game I just can’t win.” In another restaurant the question would rankle, but the mood at Jeffrey’s is so unpretentious that it seems only neighborly to comply. The food, like the staff, is straightforward. A three-level plateau de mer is a Dutch still-life of crab legs, shrimp, lobster tail, velvety salmon tartare, and a bicoastal selection of oysters, simply garnished with wedges of lemon. A charcuterie plate is piled with a house-cured, anise-laced duck breast and thinly sliced ham, salami, and delectable prosciutto from, of all places, Iowa. Misfires are few, and forgiveness comes easily. When a chicken-liver-and-foie-gras terrine arrives runny, the waiter commiserates, “I wish the kitchen could get that consistent—when it’s good, it’s just great.”</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">Lunch is a soup, salad, and sandwich affair. The clam chowder’s a standout, a cream-rich New England with plump shellfish, chunks of potatoes, a grace note of Old Bay, and just enough bacon to lend it smoky depth. A juicy roast pork proves more than its soaked-through ciabatta can handle. Better is the braised brisket, blanketed in melted Muenster, which gets a kick from beet-horseradish slaw and toast-crisp sourdough bread. Less hearty appetites will be happy with a cold poached-salmon salad on mustard greens, topped with tangy avocado-mint yogurt. As for dessert, if you’re lucky, your waitress will overhear a friend say “Happy birthday,” and your meal will end with a candle-lit slice of red velvet cake, that much sweeter for being a surprise.

The women look like they might be jewelry designers and are overheard pronouncing Kenya “Keen-ya,” while the men are almost universally floppy-haired and insist on wearing their plaid scarves through dinner.</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">Most of them aren’t eating a lot—the tequila-based ginger cocktail seems the most widely ordered item in the room—and that’s a shame, because the food is much better than it needs to be. Far from coasting on trendiness, the restaurant turns out whimsical and inventive creations, new twists on the familiar farm-to-table shtick. The owners, who operate a popular downtown catering business, seem determined to make vegetables fun. Among the more ingenious appetizers, a beet crumble comes swaddled in muslin, which a diner unwraps to reveal a mini loaf pan of scalloped roasted beets topped with a thin but potent sheet of goat cheese and a crunchy winter-weight blanket of oats and hazelnuts. A celery-root pot pie is proof that puff pastry makes everything better.</p><p data-wc="180" word_count="180">A generous conviviality is apparent in the smallest things. A decent house red is one of several glasses for ten dollars or less. “Thick-cut chips” are fried in duck fat, to make them extra crispy. A one-plate roast meal—chicken, heritage pork chop, or beef fillet—is offered on Sunday nights in winter. Sometimes you wish the kitchen would be a little more aggressive. A curried yogurt dressing atop a pile of cauliflower needed more heat to stand up to all that virtuous cruciferousness. And a monkfish vindaloo was not as intriguing as it sounded, requiring more than its fair share of long-bean chutney. But, when there’s a dessert involving clotted cream and a chocolate cake so delicious you’d never know it was made with beets, it seems churlish to criticize an excess of amiability—or attractiveness. The good-looking people are enjoying themselves, and the comforting soundtrack—Sneaker Pimps, Counting Crows, and other mid-nineties bands originally played on a Sony Discman—isn’t the least bit cool.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/umi-nom	Umi Nom	433 DeKalb Ave., Brooklyn 	40.690505	-73.9599219	718-789-8806	2010/12/20	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="128" word_count="128">To the intrepid eater, there are few prospects more thrilling than venturing to some out-of-the-way place for the sole purpose of trying something exotic. Umi Nom, a new restaurant from the chef King Phojanakong, of the Lower East Side’s Kuma Inn, might seem like a worthy such destination. Phojanakong was born and raised in New York, but his interest in cooking grew out of summers spent in his mother’s native Philippines: in Tagalog, <em>kumain</em> means “eat”; <em>uminom</em> is “drink.” Even in a city as culinarily diverse as New York, Filipino food is scarce, and though Umi Nom is just a stone’s throw from Pratt it feels quite isolated, occupying a former “drycleanomat” (the old sign still hangs above the storefront) on an otherwise nondescript block.</p><p data-wc="196" word_count="196">Unfortunately, Filipino food is scarce at Umi Nom, too. Phojanakong’s father is Thai, and one can hardly fault him for attempting to honor both sides of his heritage. But the result is a menu of mostly hackneyed Asian-fusion “small plates,” with a handful of noodle and rice dishes (the tired standbys pad Thai and pad see ew among them) tacked on as if an afterthought. The few traditional Filipino offerings are well executed and addictively comforting: beef <em>tapa</em>, jerky-like strips of sirloin served with a pungent smoked chili paste; <em>pancit canton</em>, slippery egg noodles studded with coins of sweet sausage, chicken, and baby bok choy. A juice made from <em>kalamansi</em>, a citrus fruit that grows in the Philippines, is delightfully tart and refreshing, a sort of clementine lemonade—not to mention the only exciting thing <em>uminom</em> until Umi Nom starts liquor service (its license was recently approved). But the panko-crusted fish and chips could have come from the seedy fried-chicken joint next door (minus the wasabi aioli), the ground-beef patties in the steamed-bun sliders are as gray and listless as cafeteria burgers, and almost everything is garnished with the same uninspired clump of pickled radish.</p><p data-wc="175" word_count="175">One recent special, however, might just merit a trek. The servers describe it as “a boiled duck egg, twelve to fourteen days old,” and, when pressed, will explain that it’s “partially fertilized.” In other words, it’s halfway to hatching—“sometimes there are feathers, or bones,” you may be warned—and not for the weak of stomach. A brave diner is instructed to crack off the top of the shell, sip the “broth,” then spoon out the rich, creamy yolk, an egg white the consistency of a pencil eraser, and, well, a duck embryo. In the Philippines, it’s called <em>balut</em> and is sold on the street as a snack; here in America, it’s been used to challenge contestants on “Fear Factor.” Wash it down with a bowl of <em>halo-halo</em>, a Filipino dessert made of shaved ice topped with condensed milk, coconut ice cream, and a mysterious assortment of colorful gelatin cubes, beans, and fruit, and tick Umi Nom off your list.

Whitewashed brick walls and green patterned wallpaper have the spare beauty of a homestead. Anticipatory diners mill about like sheep waiting to be sheared; the curve of one wainscot wall echoes the lines of a silo; an apple-cider shandy tastes like it’s straight from the orchard (where grows, perhaps, the Northern Spy, an apple variety). The tables groan with abundance: shredded kale heaped high, with a snowy drift of cheese across the top, pumpkin ravioli plumped to prize-winning heft, brawny pork meatballs rolling in rich marinara sauce.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">There’s elegance to the bounty, too. An appetizer of oil-poached squid and mussels, mixed with navy beans and carrots into something approaching a stew, comes sprinkled with crispy rice, which adds a surprising texture and a not unpleasant undertone of char. The astringent crunch of fennel artfully underpins a spicy, tender pork sandwich. Northern Spy Food Co.’s chef, Nathan Foot, hails from San Francisco, and retains a certain West Coast sincerity that extolls from-the-earth flavors. Cheddar, roasted squash, and almonds in a kale salad enliven, without overshadowing, the cabbage. The creaminess of baked eggs over polenta offers a fine setting for robust wild mushrooms. A whole chicken dinner, meant for two, makes for a down-home meal: roasted potatoes with a hint of Dijon, bacony collard greens, and superb chicken so lusciously moist as to make a jus served on the side redundant.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">The original concept—a casual dining area, with a curated market of goods in the back—has fallen away, though one cubby, made from a reclaimed chicken coop, remains by the kitchen, stocked with jars of jam and bags of coffee. Instead, the focus has shifted toward a more refined dining experience, and prices have climbed a bit, though not outrageously. After all, it’s quite a trick to produce a tart with the sophisticated mien of pear and frangipane that’s as wonderfully homey as any blue-ribbon entry at the county fair.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/06/beer-table	Beer Table	427 Seventh Ave., at 14th St., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2010/12/06	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="134" word_count="134">When drinking beer—it’s the third most popular beverage in the world, behind water and tea—any old brand, for the most part, will do. But when drinking beer at Beer Table, a tiny, ambitious establishment in south Park Slope, any old brand might include the Bayerischer Bahnhof Berliner Weisse, from Germany (described on the menu as “lemon zest, hazy, delicious dishwater”), or Pretty Things Baby Tree, from Cambridge, Massachusetts (“dried plums, brown sugar, dark fruit, almost tart”). The married owners, Justin and Tricia Philips, built on Justin’s origins in beer importing and sunk their savings into this boutique bar a few years ago, and their exuberance shows; the menu includes a daily-changing list of twenty-five obscure international micro-batches in bottles, a few on tap, and a thoughtful selection of beer-friendly food.</p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">Great tufts of mugwort, an ancient beer ingredient, which the owners scavenged from Prospect Park for a brewing experiment, are suspended from a high ceiling, next to light fixtures made of bare bulbs inside mason glass. Occasionally a server pulls a jar of dehydrated tomatoes or apples—to be repurposed from décor to appetizer plate—from a wall also stacked with, what else, bottles of beer. The staff, it seems, have memorized a beer enthusiast’s encyclopedia. A waitress explains that brewers run the gamut from extremely meticulous to highly winging it. One Belgian brewery, for example, is “just one guy. The rumor is he stole his yeast. It’s mutated because of the way he maintained it. At first his beers were tart; now they’re sweet.” And what about the Schlenkerla Oak Smoke, from Germany? “For six hundred years, they used beechwood for smoking the malt. Then one day someone said, ‘Why not oak?’ Those are good. I drink so many of those, I should know.” She is right.</p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">The food is designed for pairing. A minuscule kitchen turns out piquant snacks like addictive pickled eggs with salt and jalepeño powder and luscious Grafton Cheddar melted on white toast; main dishes might include thick-cut maple-glazed bacon with roasted fingerling potatoes or butter-bean stew topped with a hefty dollop of mayo. “Put a salad on the menu,” a thin, lovely woman pleaded. But she was up for dessert—butterscotch pudding with cocoa nibs, ricotta toast, and a blondie. And to go with those, the volatile, beguiling Vapeur Cochonnette (“coriander, roast chicory, anise, pepper, candi sugar”). After knocking back a few, it’s hard to resist dreaming up your own beer descriptions, as one table did: “Prunes, diatomaceous earth, macaroni and cheese. Pine shavings, but a winter pine.” (Open daily for dinner until midnight and Sundays for brunch. Entrées $9-$12.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/29/the-chefs-table-at-brooklyn-fare	The Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare	200 Schermerhorn St., Brooklyn 	40.6885026	-73.985483545457	718-243-0050	2010/11/29	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="89" word_count="89">By day, on a deserted block in downtown Brooklyn, César Ramírez supervises the prepared foods for the gourmet grocery store Brooklyn Fare. By night, in a prep kitchen three doors down, the Mexican-born, Bouley-trained chef commands an audience of eighteen, seated around a brushed-stainless-steel bar, with an extravagant culinary spectacle. The experience, which was originally billed as a cooking class (and which was recently awarded two Michelin stars), is heavily theatrical: dishes are plated in canon using tweezers and chopsticks, and hushed reverence is all but requested.</p><p data-wc="219" word_count="219">The nine-course menu changes weekly, and starts with a flurry of unlisted canapés. Diners might pop fried hunks of blowfish tail, marvel at a sardine woven into a potato chip, and learn that <em>kataifi</em> is shredded phyllo dough, all before dinner even begins. As each dish is presented, Ramírez dispenses suggestions ranging from spoon selection (“Ma’am, your demitasse would be better”) to the ideal number of bites (one or two). The aluminum bar stools aren’t the only source of a slight chill; a stern note on the menu reads “We request no pictures or notes are taken and cell phones be used outside.” But then there’s the first official course—cod roe layered with baccalà mousse, crispy potato bits, and caramelized onions, topped with a heap of Burgundy truffle shavings—and it is wickedly good. The menu, with Japanese, Italian, and French influences, leans on fish and seafood. A Kumamoto oyster hovers between a Meyer-lemon gelée and a round film of oyster juice atop a dollop of crème fraîche, and fluke sashimi wears a disk of pickled daikon. For all his ingenuity, Ramírez can also make new sense of classic flavors: a raviolo of rich veal shank is balanced perfectly by salty Parmesan, sweet Vidalia onions, and delicately bitter spinach.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">According to the hostess, the liquor license and mother-of-pearl caviar spoons are on the way. In the meantime, the lack of a corkage fee makes for high-end water-cooler chat by the D.I.Y. sommelier station. One evening, diners swapped splashes of Barolo and tales of Per Se while admiring the copper cookware and the Molteni, “The Ferrari of stoves!” And the hostess gave one customer’s Ribolla Gialla the ultimate praise: It’s going on the wine list.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/22/vandaag	Vandaag	103 Second Ave. 	51.8250795	1.2413677	212-253-0470	2010/11/22	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="95" word_count="95">There are certain dining trends in this city that will not die. There’s the faux speakeasy (suspenders, beards, very large ice cubes). The “just like Nonna used to make it” Italian joint (homemade ricotta, short-rib ragù, two-hour waits). Even the humble pork chop has come to represent an entire genre of new-American establishment (Brussels sprouts, local seasonal fruit crisps, West Village or Smith Street). It’s refreshing, then, to encounter a restaurant that falls into none of these categories, educating diners in the cuisine of a country until now unrepresented on MenuPages: the Netherlands. </p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">Vandaag is a grownup sort of place, where the waiters dust away the crumbs between courses, but it doesn’t seem too extravagant for a Tuesday night. Which is not to say the kitchen is lacking in ambition: an amuse-bouche of hen-liver mousse on a rye crisp, presented on a shard of slate, immediately signals a seriousness of intent. The rest of the menu follows through, and is full of unusual combinations that delight more often than they offend. A witty salad features pickled green strawberries with red Russian kale. A sea-urchin bisque comes in a cup and saucer, with the velvety richness of a refined hot chocolate. Lamb sweetbreads sit alongside Concord grapes, a twist on turkey and cranberry sauce. Littleneck clams come hidden under a thatched roof of shoestring fries—parsnip, not potato. </p><p data-wc="202" word_count="202">There are occasional missteps: the audacity of charging six dollars for a bread basket outside of midtown is not quite mitigated by the accompanying gin-scented butter. A bony quail dish in a strange hoisin-like sauce confirms the view that the little bird, like blue crab, may just be too much work. But everything, hit or miss, looks perfect—in an austere, aggressively contemporary kind of way. An otherwise forgettable entrée of braised lamb riblets is garnished with desiccated slices of cauliflower resembling tiny leafless trees in a stark wintry landscape. And anything would be easy to forgive after an order of the <em>kopstoot</em>, or “head butt,” consisting of a glass of <em>genever</em>—a type of young gin first sold as medicine in late-sixteenth-century Holland—chased by lager. Pair it, as goes tradition, with <em>bitterballen</em>, a deep-fried ball of generously breaded oxtail, like falafel for carnivores. The waitress tries to manage expectations about the <em>kopstoot</em>: “It’s a smaller shot than it first appears.” But, on completion, you might feel like a Dutch undergraduate celebrating the end of exams, an entirely new and exhilarating sensation.

Even the tabletops have a touch of insanity: they’re covered in white rubber mats instead of linens. Matteo Boglione, the Florentine chef who earned his stripes at Falai and Gradisca, has opened a theme park of a restaurant in the former Arqua space in Tribeca. Colorful circular banquettes, outfitted with tiny wheels and theatrically mounted on stages, may make diners feel like they’re strapped into a Mad Tea Party ride, but Boglione’s inventive menu is no roller coaster: the ups far outnumber the downs. </p><p data-wc="275" word_count="275">At night, red lights line the ceiling and the restaurant is packed. So is the bar, where the Italian mixologist Christina Bini tests the limits of potable weirdness with cocktails like the Zucchidorini (green apple, green squash, and Midori) and the Buffalo 66 (rosemary vodka, Worcestershire sauce, and beet juice); a dry Martini arrives with a vermouth-soaked black stone from Mongolia. (White Ligurian pebbles would make the drink sweet, the waitress explained to a puzzled diner: “they’re more porous, so they hold more vermouth.”) Given the culinary eccentricities to follow, diners might want to stick to the wine list. It’s fitting that a meal ending with a nightshade vegetable (in a surprisingly tasty white-chocolate-laced <em>millefoglie</em>) should start with a crème brûlée. A savory Pecorino custard, offset by a burnt-sugar crust, is accompanied by red-onion marmalade and a balsamic reduction. The tired combination of mozzarella, tomato, and basil is refreshed as a velvety buffalo-cheese soup, served with a dollop of tomato ice and herb-dusted crostini. But don’t stop at cheese: crisp artichoke croquettes, plump steamed octopus, and tender braised pork belly (playing turf to the surf of head-on shrimp) are all worth a nibble. Save room for pasta, where Boglione’s Italian roots serve him well. Spelt may not top most must-order lists, but Boglione’s <em>lasagnette</em>, its finespun noodles made from the grain, combines flavors of burrata, fresh tomato, and pesto so bright it’s like summer on a plate. Less successful is the squid-ink gnocchi. The garnish—succulent crabmeat and fried artichokes—is delicious, but the dumplings themselves prove an insubstantial companion, even though they look like charcoal briquettes.</p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">Meat and fish are hit or miss. On one visit, a pork fillet was fork-tender on a bed of roasted peaches and spinach; another time, it was dry. Chicken billed as “pine nut crusted” is, in fact, rolled in peanuts. As for dessert—classic tiramisu, chocolate flan, panna cotta in licorice sauce—go crazy, order the eggplant.

Or, rather, there is a two-story storefront that someone has covered in chunky stone facing and plastic ivy in the hope of evoking a baronial manse. This is Rabbit in the Moon, the latest—and arguably the silliest—gastropub to come to the Village. Inside the entrance is a wall-mounted deer head adorned with a large string of pearls; this luckless beast comes to seem like a kind of presiding spirit, embodying the restaurant’s off-kilter attempt to both conjure tradition and tweak it. There are armchairs and big fireplaces, shelves of Waverley novels, clumsily reproduced paintings of Shakespeare, Byron, and Wordsworth. The menu has fish-and-chips, bangers-and-mash, a Pimm’s cocktail fancied up with kumquats, and something called a “Lady Diana negroni.” It’s as if someone who’d never been in a pub had tried to construct one after looking up “pub” on Wikipedia. This may not be as unlikely as it sounds: stencilled on the ceiling of the upstairs bar is a long text—“The inhabitants of the U.K. have been drinking beer since the Bronze Age . . .”—that really does come from the Wikipedia entry for “pub.”</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">The laziness and the cynicism on display here typify what is making the Village an increasingly terrible place to get dinner. There’s the reluctance to seat you while tables sit empty for hours at a time; the sense that the restaurant considers itself a “destination” (visitors have included Oliver Stone and Janet Jackson); and the continual tension between what the place pretends to be and what it is. Recently, a barman making a so-called 8th Street Smash (Maker’s Mark, brandied cherries, orgeat, bitters) didn’t even bother to hide the fact that he was substituting a lowlier whiskey from the rail. The switch betrays two annoying assumptions: that you truly care about name-brand spirits and that you won’t notice what you’re drinking.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Randomly enough, the cooking’s not bad. The fish-and-chips improves on its greasy namesake, with a light beer batter surrounding silky cod, and fries sprinkled with roasted thyme; the rib eye is decent. And very fresh, pliant gnocchi come in a dauntingly rich sauce of artichoke, pine nuts, and parsley. Desserts sound unexciting but are imaginatively executed. A panna cotta is covered by a thin lemony film and has shards of sugar glass scattered over the top; around it tiny basil leaves sit in small puddles of eggy foam. For some reason, the dessert menu bears the coat of arms of King George II. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $17-$34.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Until recently, it was a moot point: Montreal bagels were nowhere to be found in the five boroughs. Now, Noah Bernamoff and Rae Cohen, a young couple who met as students at McGill, are giving New Yorkers a chance to study the competition up close: their matchbox-size Boerum Hill deli, named after a once primarily Jewish neighborhood in Montreal, is a loyal homage to the comfort food that still defines the area—and to the city at large, down to the Labatt Bleue on the menu and the hockey-player glossies in the rest room.</p><p data-wc="229" word_count="229">At first glance, the Montreal bagel, shipped hot from way up north, then “spritzed and shvitzed” as necessary (a splash of water, a quick turn in the oven), seems a mere shadow of its New York counterpart. Consider it foremost a vehicle for fixings, though, and you may even come to appreciate that it’s smaller, denser, and sweeter—hand-rolled without salt and parboiled in honey water—a demure foil for cream cheese and lox or an excellent whitefish salad, coarse-chopped with celery, pickled asparagus, and dill. “Smoked meat,” as Montrealers call their darker, earthier pastrami cousin, speaks loudly for itself. Bernamoff makes his own, dry-curing whole briskets in garlic, peppercorns, and coriander, then oak-smoking and steaming them. Drugstore-style counter seats afford a satisfying view as he carves the mountainous hunks of beef into craggy slices, to be sandwiched in Orwasher’s rye bread or shredded atop the hand-cut frites, rich mushroom gravy, and melting cheese curds of a perfect poutine. “It’s like a diamond in the rough,” remarked one eager spectator, as a brisket’s grainy black exterior gave way to glistening pink. Chewy onion rolls, slathered in mustard and loaded with house-made salami, are griddled flat for the Ruth Wilensky, named after the proprietress of an iconic Montreal lunch counter, who charges ten cents extra for no mustard—a policy that Mile End adopts for kicks.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">Except for a superlative matzo-ball soup, the menu’s more familial offerings—potato latkes at brunch, roast chicken at dinner—don’t fare quite as well, biases aside, unless your bubbe tends to overdo it on the salt. And any true New Yorker, like a good grandchild, will never flip bagel teams. But Cohen, her face framed by thick bangs and cat’s-eye glasses, exudes a nostalgic, earnest warmth as she presides over the tiny space, welcoming regulars—including, one evening, the restaurant’s “mayor” on Foursquare—and newcomers alike; with Simon and Garfunkel crooning softly in the background and a breeze coming in through the bay windows, it’s enough to make anyone feel at home.

And so it was inevitable that this Southeast Asian barbecue joint, from Zak Pelaccio, an owner of Fatty Crab, and Robbie Richter, the former pit master of Hill Country, would become the subject of intense interest a full two years before its opening. Construction workers were interrogated on the likely opening date. A stray cooker spotted in a nearby parking lot was photographed exclusively for Eater.com and dissected by knowledgeable commenters (“looks like a knock-off of a New Braunfels/Oklahoma Joe smoker”). When the restaurant finally opened its doors to the trilby-hatted hipsters of Williamsburg’s south side, the word came, naturally, via a food critic’s Twitter feed.</p><p data-wc="229" word_count="229">For all the hype, it’s fortunate that the food turns out to be nearly irresistible—which explains why they ran out of half the entrées by nine o’clock one Saturday. Begin by ordering the Master Fat, a runny, schmaltz-like substance made from the drippings of all the different meats barbecued in-house. It sounds like a dare and is perhaps not quite as tasty as it should be, but, soaked up with Pullman toast—wimpy, wonderfully pliant, greased to oblivion—it’s like eating the world’s naughtiest grilled cheese. The black-eyed peas in a rich curry sauce with cubes of beef, another starter, are so addictive they ought to be served in a Pez dispenser. Once the finger food is done and it’s time to really eat with your hands, there are mountains of meat—thoughtfully sourced pork, lamb, and beef smoked out back and marinated in an exuberant blend of fish sauce, cilantro, chiles, and palm sugar. If varieties are at times indistinguishable from one another, that is only a testament to the simple deliciousness of it all: an elegantly crossed pair of shiny, slippery pork ribs; a pick ’n’ mix selection of tangy “pork parts”; and, best of all, sheets of thinly sliced brisket, to be stuffed into chubby <em>bao</em>, or buns, then dipped in house-made aioli and smothered in sweet chile jam.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">The desserts are a tough sell: who at this point has room for pie or homemade chocolate bars? Instead, order another round of Smokin Bone cocktails. The bartenders take a postmodern approach, offering cocktails deconstructed, as separate shots. But leaving the Bone unassembled would be a shame: whiskey, smoked-pineapple syrup, lime, Tabasco, and chocolate bitters are better together. Above the bar, movies play soundlessly on a wall-mounted television, lending the place a roadhouse feel. One night, as if primed for a clever Tweet, the restaurant screened “There Will Be Blood.” There was. (Open Mondays through Fridays for dinner and Saturdays and Sundays for brunch and dinner.

The place began life as the evening tenant at the Dumbo General Store, where it swiftly accumulated plaudits for the food’s creative, vibrant flavors. A new, full-time location was found last winter, on the Bowery, and a team of craftsmen gave the space an industrial-chic sheen: exposed-brick walls, a planked wood ceiling, an enormous steel air duct running the length of the room.</p><p data-wc="201" word_count="201">The atmosphere is meant to evoke the sophistication of contemporary Mexico, and the food is appropriately urbane. Serious diners may gravitate toward the chef’s table in the back, where the lights are brighter, the din is dimmer, and there’s an unimpeded view of how your food is <em>hecho</em>. The cooks have a calm, confident air that bodes well, and they take a spare approach, using just a few ingredients to superb effect. A heap of practically undressed, deliciously sweet crab arrives on warm corn fritters still slowly deflating from the fryer. Three nearly bite-size lobster tacos are stuffed full, and have a slight tang of orange and a nice kick at the end. Crocks of melted cheese, with chorizo, poblano peppers, or mushrooms, come with tortillas: do-it-yourself quesadillas. That both the <em>queso</em> and the tortillas are made fresh, in-house, elevates what might otherwise seem like an easy score. Because the cooks seem to avoid any sort of fancy presentation, the plates can have all the charm of cafeteria fare; but, while pale burritos set adrift on white plates may look unappetizingly monochromatic, the flavors inside them—braised steak, pork-belly chorizo, or a savory mixture of mushrooms—are indisputably topnotch.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">For all the gastronomic earnestness, the scene feels raw and energized. Guys wear tight jeans and shiny, untucked button-downs; girls sport short shorts, lots of bangles, and tousled updos, and visit the unisex bathroom in pairs. Strong margaritas, salt on the rim, suit the crowd, though the occasional iconoclast sips a <em>Michelada cubana</em>, a concoction that could be described as a beer-infused Bloody Mary. On a recent evening, a waitress resembling the “Evita”-era Madonna, with a perfectly twisted chignon and dramatically arched black eyebrows, pointed out that the predominance of Mexican nationals on the staff, including herself, made for a strong cheering section during the World Cup. After revealing that she also sings in a band, she was asked for a performance. She protested, “I haven’t had any tequila yet!” (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays and Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $8-$17.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/tables-for-two-the-lion	The Lion	62 W. 9th St. 	43.382064625	-98.8456065	212-353-8400	2010/10/11	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="117" word_count="117">Can a restaurant seduce the haut monde while still catering to the upwardly mobile masses? The Lion equivocates artfully, employing a doorman who lets pretty much anyone in, and swaddling itself in glamorous lore. In the sixties, it was the gay cabaret where Barbra Streisand, after winning a back-room talent contest, was hired to sing, for fifty bucks a week and all the London broil her heart desired. Then the space became Village, a neighborhood mainstay, offering reliable omelettes and steak frites. Now, several high-profile investors (including Dan Abrams, of NBC News, and Tony DiSanto, MTV’s programming chief) and the chef-owner John DeLucie, formerly of the Waverly Inn, are working hard to bring back the buzz. </p><p data-wc="248" word_count="248">The crush in the cacophonous, vaguely Bavarian front tavern, which pushes a menu of overworked cocktails like the Lion’s Paw (a dull mix of cucumber vodka, rosewater, and lime), can be unpleasant—too much eager ambition on display, by patrons and purveyors alike. But it’s more relaxed in the clubby back dining room, where there’s plenty of art (duelling Basquiats, a Warhol portrait by David LaChapelle, black-and-white shots of Al Capone, Babe Ruth, and Muhammad Ali), a grand skylight, and DeLucie’s cheddar biscuits to help set the tone of comfortable indulgence. Velvety corn purée, garnished with Dungeness crab and truffle oil, comes with some free shtick: as one waiter describes it, another sidles up to interject, “After tasting the corn soup, it was so good the chef decided it should be nineteen dollars,” instead of fifteen. Funny, until it turns out to be true. A foie-gras torchon—here it’s more a symbol of luxury than a culinary apogee—is paired with honey and peaches, or cherries, like a soulful panna cotta. Fennel is sneaked into a Caesar salad, to pleasing effect, while the burger, loamy with pork belly, is a tad too rich. The pastas should be better; a ponderous Petit Basque-covered truffle-laced gnocchi outstays its welcome. And DeLucie’s lobster potpie, a self-proclaimed signature dish, needs work—either the lobster meat is overcooked or the top crust is a gummy mess; it’s a shame, because the brandy-cream sauce is spot-on.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">For all the self-conscious spectacle, the staff is highly skilled and courteous, if precocious. If you’re lucky, you might be whisked upstairs for a tour of the handsome library hidden behind a bookcase, making you feel vaguely like Colonel Mustard in a game of Clue. “We’re hoping this will become a hangout for certain people,” the ambassador of secret rooms murmurs, as he presses an ecru card into your palm. “Drop by anytime.” (Open for daily for dinner.

All the A’s are going to McDonalds!), you might say that the city’s kitchens have never been more transparent. At Balaboosta, in Nolita, it’s a matter of Windex. A floor-to-ceiling box window grants passersby a direct view into the space’s cramped kitchen—citizen inspections on a whim. The other night, containers were opened cautiously and resealed tightly. All the cooks wore head coverings, except for the bald one. Morale-boosting candids of the owners’ baby hung on the wall. A middle-aged man walking his dog paused to watch a line cook prepare an appetizer. “They deep-fry their cauliflower?” he muttered to himself. “Huh.” The mise-en-scène, efficient and expert, beguiled even more than the skivvies dangling in the window of the lingerie shop across the street.</p><p data-wc="251" word_count="251">Balaboosta’s dining room, with its dark planked-wood ceiling and tranquil cream-colored walls, is equally alluring, though the bathrooms, lit only with black lights, are freakishly reminiscent of tanning beds: one longs for those little white eyecups. The chef, Einat Admony, who also runs Taïm, the ballyhooed falafel joint in the West Village, comes from Tel Aviv, and her restaurant’s name is a Yiddish word meaning “perfect housewife.” That suggests the place is boring or, at best, of transitory enjoyment, but Admony produces spunky, nouveau-Mediterranean fare, and the waiter is right when he boasts, “The food really is as good as everything you’ve heard.” This rings especially true for the small plates, like that cauliflower, which is tossed with pine nuts and currants, as well as the falafel-encrusted meatballs and the phyllo-wrapped shrimp, which is served with a bracing flying-fish-roe sauce. Many diners have groused over the “mortar and pestle” hummus, which you must grind yourself, but it’s just a downtown version of pick-your-own-apples, more recreation than labor. A six-inch pizza—carrot purée, caramelized onions, goat cheese, and cilantro—seems far too salubrious to satisfy, until, of course, it does. Entrées run more conventional: seared sea bass, spicy skirt steak, a half chicken cooked under a brick. When the date-and-banana bread pudding comes around, tablemates jostle for it, each citing the need for thorough inspection.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/27/the-plaza-food-hall	The Plaza Food Hall	null	null	null	null	2010/09/27	<p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Outside the entrance to the Plaza, a little girl recently channelled the precocious spirit of Eloise, theatrically whispering to her mother, “I don’t know if we’re allowed in here. It smells too clean!” The child was on to something. There is a certain haute-mall feel to “The Shops at the Plaza,” with its Ungaro, Assouline, and Ghurka boutiques, and so it seems fitting that a high-class commissary has nestled into the basement, formerly the hotel’s laundry facilities. Todd English has evidently bristled at the notion that his new “Food Hall”—as in nineteenth-century, Old World, sophisticated—has anything to do with that vulgar, sanitized postwar American monstrosity the shopping mall. But the pretense is flimsy: this is a fancy food court, and it fulfills its function with gusto. </p><p data-wc="219" word_count="219">A diner-in-waiting can peruse shelves packed with items like shallot confit, walnut preserves, and curried squash; there are fetchingly arrayed baskets of fruits and vegetables—not just for show but for sale. A clipboard holds a sheaf of seven menus, each of which corresponds to a specialty: dumplings, sushi, pizza, grilled meat, fish, tapas, and pasta; barstools overlook the cooking stations. One couple ended up downwind from the fiery maw of the pizza oven and voiced a desire to move. In response, the pizza chef cheerfully winked, quoted the temperature of the oven (seven hundred and fifty degrees), and went back to work. Still, it’s hard to go wrong with the unfussy pizzas, whose crust achieves the beau ideal of consistency, managing to be chewy and crisp at once. The tapas selection, too, is bursting with exceptional things. A tender and flavorful lamb skewer comes festively adorned with rouille and a lovely micro-salad of herbs and onions. The charred octopus achieves what Spanish-inspired dishes almost never do: a balancing act in which garlic neither overwhelms nor shrinks back from the main ingredient. The pork dumplings, on the other hand, are somehow both soggy and underdone, and the accompanying “house-made plum sauce,” which seems like vinegar thickened with honey, provoked a wince—not so much of disgust as disbelief.</p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">The something-for-everyone ethos hardly lends itself to great flights of fancy, but the execution provides far more pleasant surprises than ugly ones. A startlingly delicious take on the ubiquitous cupcake is the CurlyCake, made by English’s daughter, Isabelle, which, despite the treacly name, is far from being too sweet. The Grasshopper, for one, is a mud-dark cake topped with an assertive green dollop of frosting that belies the subtle minty taste. It alone would be enough to lure Eloise from the tippy-top floor to the basement quicker than you can say “food court.” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

For every Jay Gatz or Madonna Louise Ciccone, there are a hundred claims adjusters and phlebotomists and tree surgeons doing their quiet parts to keep the city running smoothly. If all New Yorkers were celebrities, after all, who would chauffeur the town cars? Likewise, if every restaurant were Babbo, would anyone make it to the theatre on time? Thank goodness for unassuming little spots like Lina Frey, where you can always snag a table—and a decent hamburger—before the nine-o’clock show at the Sunshine Cinema, or after the late set at Mercury Lounge. </p><p data-wc="167" word_count="167">The menu is unlikely to surprise: <em>au poivre</em> this, <em>marinière</em> that, de-rigueur everything. Portions are small, to accommodate sharing, and the prices are as modest as the ambitions. A fennel-and-arugula salad could have used some citrus to clarify its flavors. Grilled hanger steak with “butter Lina” was chewy and charred. Mussels swam in a thick brown peppercorn sauce that congealed after a few minutes on the table. Still, that Bamba burger is better than it needs to be, with intriguing notes of paprika and fennel seed. And a crêpe stuffed with mushrooms and Emmental makes a simple, satisfying supper when paired with the lemony sautéed spinach and a cold glass of French rosé. (Lina Frey may not be as celebrated as its neighbor Katz’s, but it’s got a better wine list.) If your eggs Florentine have chalky yolks, or if your dessert crêpe tastes oddly of oregano, well, so what?

And Má Pêche means not “my peach” in French, as you might suppose, but “mother peach” in Vietnamese-French pidgin. Chang’s new midtown venture, in the Chambers Hotel, is informed by the spirit of French Indochina, with a Vietnamese-born, French-trained executive chef, Tien Ho, and pervasive pan-Asian touches. Striped bass sits in a coconut broth reminiscent of green curry. Mayonnaise accompanying crab is delicately flavored with calamansi, an Asian citrus fruit. Steak comes with rice fries—astoundingly dense and rich, like the last scrapings of a pot of sticky rice—an innovation that impresses even as it leaves you suspecting that regular fries need not fear imminent redundancy. Ho has a nice way with fish, juxtaposing voluptuous twists of raw fluke with pistachio and strawberry, but the restaurant is basically a temple to meat. Tripe and jowl are thrown into a frisée salad; gooey chunks of pig’s head are stuffed into a breaded parcel; steak and lamb loin are cooked sous-vide, the former also seared and aggressively salted, the latter accompanied by a breaded baton of lamb shoulder. For large parties willing to try it, there’s a communal feast of seven preparations of beef.</p><p data-wc="270" word_count="270">Chang’s restaurant battles valiantly against the limitations of its room, a strange scrap of space underneath the hotel. There are parking garages that elicit greater joie de vivre, but the staff is upbeat and charming, earnestly trying to make the place’s bugs seem like features: dishes arrive at various times “because they come from different parts of the kitchen,” one waiter explained gamely. And is the essence of Changness transplantable from its East Village origins? Only up to a point. Unavoidably, Má Pêche lacks the buzz that comes from cramped quarters, large numbers of chattering people, and long lines outside. A successful restaurant is, at root, a collaborative enterprise—between a chef and a clientele—and, for all Má Pêche’s achievements, something about the match isn’t quite right. Perhaps it’s because so much of Chang’s best food riffs on humble dishes, like noodles and pork buns, rather than on haute cuisine. Here, there isn’t a dud on the menu, but there’s no real triumph, either—no signature dish to seal the place’s identity, and nothing as arresting as Momofuku Noodle Bar’s simple, ingenious soy egg. Still, Má Pêche, though rarely full enough to cause anyone to wait for a table, is populated much later than the average hotel restaurant. On a recent evening, eight men in shirtsleeves lingered over a huge wine decanter shaped like a mad scientist’s flask, while a couple of foodies nearby ardently debated the relative merits of Ruth Reichl and Frank Bruni.

Note its relatively low price point—fourteen dollars, compared to thirty at some of its competitors—and utter simplicity of preparation: top-sliced bun, buttered and toasted, a light smear of mayo, a full quarter pound of lobster meat, a shake of what’s mostly celery salt, a drizzle of lemon-infused butter. (Luke Holden, one of the restaurants’ co-owners, gave away the recipe recently on the “Today” show, as Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford cooed over his baby face.) Luke’s even offers a frequent-roll club: buy ten, get one free. So far, the strategy is working. On a recent evening, the line to order extended out the door and down the sidewalk, with one double-parking customer causing a noisy traffic jam: the urban version of foghorns sounding off the coast. </p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">Holden’s family owns a seafood-processing plant in Maine, and he calls his roll the first fully traceable one in New York. (A sign at the register notes the provenance of that day’s catch.) In a spot predicated on authenticity—so much is sourced from Maine, from the buns to the soup to the soda, that it feels blasphemous to discover that the Miss Vickie’s chips are made by Frito-Lay, in Dallas—there’s an awful lot of nautical kitsch. Surrounded by lobster traps, a “Gone Fishin’ “ sign, a life preserver, a seashore mural, claw saltshakers, and a crustacean statuette labelled “Please don’t feed the lobster!,” you feel as though you’ve stumbled into a Down East Applebee’s. </p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">Still, crowds rarely lie. The shrimp and crab rolls are stuffed full of juicy seafood, and are even more affordable than the signature roll; the clam chowder and the lobster bisque are both admirable renditions, though diners might want to save them for cooler weather. Of course, most people are there for the main item, and it delivers. The only drawback to its straightforward presentation is that if the hand doing the seasoning happens to lay it on a little heavy, there’s not much to mitigate it. To conclude a meal, it might make sense to order lobster tracks—red-tinged chocolate-caramel cups in vanilla ice cream—but to do so you have to rejoin the snaking line. It’s a conundrum that has driven some customers to take matters into their own hands: cupcakes from Two Little Red Hens, just up the avenue, with a mascot more Rhode Island than Maine.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/16/pulinos-bar-and-pizzeria	Pulino’s Bar And Pizzeria	282 Bowery, at Houston St. 	null	null	null	2010/08/16	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="194" word_count="194">For three decades, Keith McNally’s restaurants have been where the young go to waste their youth, and the old to pretend they’ve reclaimed it. The Odeon, with which McNally débuted, in 1980, graces the cover of Jay McInerney’s “Bright Lights, Big City,” while Richard Price lists McNally in the acknowledgements of his 2008 novel, “Lush Life.” In many ways, his establishments are swappable—the food might vary (and taste pretty good), but, like dinner theatre, above all one arrives to watch. Pulino’s (No. 11) intends to distinguish itself from its McNally siblings not only by prioritizing pizza but also by romanticizing the all but bygone squalor of the Bowery. Tables are constructed from deconstructed police barricades, and the T-shirts worn by the staff read, in stencilled lettering, “Do Not Cross the Line.” Recently, a waiter shouted over the din, “Sure, it’s a little gimmicky, but what it really means is: Don’t cross the line with me.” He splashed wine into the diners’ empty glasses and didn’t laugh. When another line, the one for a table, curls out the door all night, every night, you quickly get the power dynamic.</p><p data-wc="231" word_count="231">The Bowery, it turns out, takes its name from the Dutch word <em>bowerij</em>, meaning “farm,” and McNally, who arguably is less trendsetter than trend stalker, is down with the fresh, the local, and the artisanal. (How could he not be, with Whole Foods glowering from across the street?) McNally’s chef, Nate Appleman, a young lion from San Francisco, moved the restaurant’s wine off-site so that a character called Billy the Butcher can freely carve up lambs and pigs and poultry in the cellar. The work produces lovely <em>salumi</em>, as well as sumptuous things like the roasted chicken leg, with claw intact, and the pork-and-beef meatballs, charred just so on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside. Several starters, like the melon salad, the beet salad, and the arugula-and-fennel salad, are merely acceptable preludes to Appleman’s pizzas. One of the best is the <em>polpettine</em>, where you get meatballs again, along with Grana and delicious pickled chiles. One of the worst is the <em>tonno</em>, a discomfiting concoction of tuna, anchovies, capers, and, instead of cheese, vigorous globs of tomato sauce. A surer bet is the <em>bianca tradizionale</em>, where a glaze of pork lard rarefies simple mozzarella. Dessert brings almond shaved ice, which looks like a bowl of fresh snow and trumps any powder that McInerney ever found at Odeon. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The last tenant took a multimillion-dollar payout, Forest City Ratner’s heavy equipment has moved in, and Freddy’s Bar has served its last beer. Just south of the buildings awaiting demolition, though, Kaz An Nou seems determined to bring a bit of Caribbean color and hope. (Its proximity to the Atlantic Yards wrecking ball has caused some concern, but the owners think they’re safe, thanks to the Seventy-eighth Precinct station house next door.)</p><p data-wc="241" word_count="241">The restaurant’s name means “our house,” and eating here does have the feeling of home: the host, waiter, and chef, Sebastien Aubert, owns and operates the place with his wife, Michelle Lane, and minimal other assistance. “We don’t have any soup tonight,” Aubert said one recent evening, by way of greeting. “The entrée special is nice and simple, but it took all my time.” The menu is small, with the addition of one or two specials each evening. (Aubert explains each one at great length; if you were taking notes, you might be able to re-create them yourself.) <em>Accra</em>—cod fritters that are fried, offered in half of a calabash shell, and dipped into a spicy aioli—are nearly always available. “I don’t like to call them a special, because now people expect them,” Aubert said. The simplicity of the project shows through in the repetition of a few key ingredients. A stuffed-avocado appetizer, topped with melted Emmentaler cheese, cuts the rich lipids with woodsy mushrooms; the same cheese appears over a gratin of plantains swimming in a soy béchamel, an almost bizarre balancing act between sweet and salty. The refreshing spiciness of a beet salad is offset by mango; the fruit reappears in the sauce for a perfectly cooked duck confit, with crisp skin and tender flesh. Avocado salsa and goat cheese top the burger, compensating for the lack of flavor in the overdone meat. </p><p data-wc="78" word_count="78">Even in the best of times, running a restaurant is hard. “It’s much easier to do this together,” Aubert, who previously helmed Ivo &amp; Lulu, in SoHo, told some diners the other evening. “At least I have someone else in it with me.” (That someone else, Lane, has kept her full-time job at a record company.) “This is like what my mom cooked,” Aubert said. “I love doing it.” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

Around the room, high shelves enshrine brightly packaged products with names ending in “o”—Stella D’oro biscotti, Polly-O ricotta, Progresso bread crumbs. “Nothing from Italy,” declares Rich Torrisi, one of a pair of chef/owners, in a video on the restaurant’s Web site. “This is American food.”</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The décor may fetishize the supermarket aisle, but the menu evinces careful sourcing. The pork chops are “heritage,” the mozzarella is served with Milk Thistle cream, and the ricotta is handmade by a local cheesemaker. You can buy it as a lunchtime side in a little paper tub, like a savory gelato, with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of fresh thyme. For the main course, try the chicken-parm hero, which, though far from subtle, is as well executed a rendition as you’ll find without leaving the borough. Wash it down with a can of Schaefer (“America’s oldest lager beer”), then clear your afternoon schedule for a nap.</p><p data-wc="181" word_count="181">Heavy as it is, lunch at Torrisi has nothing on the prix-fixe dinner, a menu that changes nightly, comprising some five antipasti, pasta, an entrée, and a legion of pastries. (You can work up an appetite while waiting two hours for one of the restaurant’s eight tables.) The most interesting dishes tend to arrive early. A starter of baccalà on charred salami bread was cleverly brightened by cured lemon. The muskiness of duck-offal ragu over fusilli was offset by sweet undertones of brandy. Dinner could have ended there, with accolades. The entrées, though, displayed excessive force: a skate filet was so drenched in butter as to obviate any other flavor; a pork chop tasted mostly of vinegar from the marinated peppers heaped on top. As for the pastry course, it recalled the ubiquitous parcel of sweets left behind at a wake. You might nibble absently at a rainbow cookie before waddling out to join the other mourners on Mulberry Street. Little Italy is dead. Long live Little Italy.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/07/26/this-little-piggy-had-roast-beef	This Little Piggy Had Roast Beef	149 First Ave., between 9th and 10th Sts., 	null	null	null	2010/07/26	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="243" word_count="243">Manhattan has long been a backwater for roast beef. Chicagoans have Italian beefs, dipped beefs, cheesy beefs, beefs with giardiniera (they even have a Web site, called Greasefreak, featuring pictures of beefs that users can sort by restaurant—Fran’s Beef, Connie’s Beef, Carm’s Beef, Jay’s Beef). The <em>rosbifs</em> have roast beefs (Henry Fielding wrote in 1731, “When mighty roast beef was the Englishman’s food, / It ennobled our hearts, and enriched our blood, / Our soldiers were brave, and our courtiers were good”). But New Yorkers’ options have mostly been limited to Roll-n-Roaster, in Sheepshead Bay. (Arby’s can make it anywhere else, but they can’t make it here: Manhattan’s sole branch closed in 2008.) Fortunately, in January, the owners of Artichoke, the pizza place, and Led Zeppole, the deep-fried-stuff-that-is-horrible-for-you place, along with a friend, William Gallagher, opened This Little Piggy Had Roast Beef. The restaurant serves four items: the This Way (beef and Cheez Whiz), the That Way (beef and mozzarella), the Other Thing (pastrami and cole slaw on rye), and the Something Else (a combination of “meats and fries and cheese on a hero”). Already, the place has inspired chauvinistic tributes. On Yelp, someone named Gabrielle M. posted a song, prompted by a visit that, she said, brought out the Sinatra in her: “I planned each roast beef course / each juicy bite—I thank thee, Yahweh! / Fresh mutz, so much au jus / That’s in a ‘THAT WAY.’ “</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">The beef: it’s Angus top round, cooked in the oven for two and a half hours, seasoned with onions, salt and pepper, and, Gallagher said, “three things we don’t want to talk about.” The That Way, dripping and spongy, with cheese like a dream, is the kind of thing you gobble down in a fever. Five minutes later, you’re slightly wheezy and surrounded, cartoonlike, by a mountain of balled-up Bounty sheets. You can’t do it every day, but you can’t not do it, either, one of these nights. The Other Thing, in cross section, is a gorgeous, bloomy pink; on the other hand, the too timid mustard lacks sharp to the meat’s sweet. The Something Else, also known as the Fuggedaboudit: do. The fries splay and soften. It’s like eating a baked potato on bread. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Sandwiches $5.50-$12.50.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/07/12/the-crosby-bar	The Crosby Bar	79 Crosby St. 	43.6770998722658	-70.29594140707	212-226-6400	2010/07/12	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="123" word_count="123">Why should a place as funky, posh, and oddly friendly as the Crosby Street Hotel (the latest outpost of London’s high-end Firmdale chain) have such middling food? The restaurant certainly looks fabulous: stunning double-height French doors that open onto cobblestoned terraces; eclectic tongue-in-cheek objets d’art (Margaret Thatcher makes an appearance in a wry Warholian tableau), multicolored striped banquettes that are heavy on the orange; tiny silver Moroccan café tables. When asked about the ten-foot carved-wood totem towering over the bar, the bartender proclaimed, “That’s a dodo bird. The theme of the hotel is the mythical creature.” Never mind that the poor dodo is not, in fact, mythological, or that the walls are dotted with regular old cows, butterflies, and dogs.</p><p data-wc="214" word_count="214">Cocktails are clearly the point here. But can they possibly be worth eighteen dollars? Compared with the bar snacks, maybe. A few weeks ago, bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with olives had an odd medicinal twang, while crab rangoons, usually high on the guilty-pleasure list, had the unmistakable essence of Long John Silver’s. A Greek salad came in what appeared to be a Depression-glass ashtray: four half-inch cubes of fried feta, a little cucumber, and some slices of flavorless black olive. Evocatively named drinks like the Pillow Talk (something to do with champagne), the Moscow Mule (basically, limeade), and even the dreamy Vieux Carré (a scrumptious lemon-infused concoction of rye, Cognac, sweet vermouth, bitters, and Benedictine) did little to redeem these morsels. There is a surprisingly good guacamole, but it can be ordered only by the quarter cup, as part of a platter that also includes some mediocre hummus and baba ghanoush, with pita bread. Fried potatoes, accompanied by a dollop of aioli spiked with large bits of raw garlic, were rustic and addictive, if pungent. A delicate grilled branzino was made less so by a thick butter sauce and chunks of sunchokes, which could have passed for boiled potatoes—not to mention a smattering of caper-like balls with the unfortunate consistency of peat moss. </p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">The Crosby Bar is popular with the after-work crowd; as the hours wear on, the denizens become more random—Jersey bachelorettes on their way to East Village karaoke; architects with new Prada shoes; Dutch gentlemen with their mothers; celebrities and their offspring. Getting there early is the trick. The laid-back afternoon tea service, it turns out, is the way to go: light pouring in through those giant windows, crustless sandwiches and a proper British scone, clotted cream and strawberry jam. It might not win a prize from London’s Tea Guild, but, honestly, who here will know the difference? (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. Entrées $18-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/07/05/tanoreen	Tanoreen	7523 Third Ave., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2010/07/05	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="56" word_count="56">In recent years, some scholars have suggested that the pomegranate is the likeliest candidate for the forbidden fruit that Adam and Eve sampled in Genesis. It’s fitting, then, that a giant painting of the pomegranate hangs over the dining area at Tanoreen, a place that revels in temptation—and, even more so, in sating it.</p><p data-wc="205" word_count="205">Tanoreen, which recently moved down this sleepy Bay Ridge block, tripling its seating in the process, is run by the Palestinian-born chef Rawia Bishara and her daughter, Jumana. The larger space seems necessary to accommodate the almost dizzying array of options: not only is the permanent menu substantial and the list of daily specials formidable but the friendly waitstaff likes to encourage ever bolder choices. (Confronted with a table of diners reluctant to commit to the <em>sujok</em>, a stupendously tangy dish whose main ingredient is “Armenian dried meat,” one server resorted to an enthusiastic form of peer pressure: “You’d be surprised how many people like it!”) It’s easy to get caught up in the madcap spirit and lose track of what has been ordered, as well as how much, and it can be a challenge to identify some of the dishes that start arriving. A greenish-brown heap appeared on the table like a delicious riddle—some parts round and some parts flat. It had diminished to almost nothing by the time one of the servers came by to explain precisely what it was that everyone was enjoying so much: fava beans, deconstructed and then sautéed, pods and all, with cumin and onions. </p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">Bishara’s cooking combines Middle Eastern techniques with Mediterranean flavors. But she takes cues from other cuisines, too. An eggplant napoleon is an ode to its principal ingredient, as well as an inspired marriage of textures: layers of feathery fried eggplant rest daintily between smears of baba ghanoush. <em>Musakhan</em>—flatbread topped with sumac-spiced chicken, slow-cooked onions, and almond slivers piled high, and sliced like a pizza—is a near-perfect harmony of sweetness and pungency.</p><p data-wc="55" word_count="55">Most evenings, Bishara makes the rounds of the restaurant, chatting animatedly with her guests. When asked about the preparation of the Brussels sprouts—both crunchy and tender, they managed to convert an avowed sprout hater on the spot—she responded triumphantly, “Deep fried!,” launching into an energetic disquisition about the healthfulness of this maligned method.</p><p data-wc="94" word_count="94">There’s really only one way to go with dessert: the house specialty, <em>knafeh</em>. It looks a bit like a box of Shredded Wheat exploded over a molten wheel of cheese—and, essentially, that’s what it is—but the delicate flavor of the orange-blossom syrup that douses the crunchy pastry combines with the mild, oozing cheese so ethereally that it might dampen one’s appreciation of cheesecake forever. Such is the cost of succumbing to temptation. (Open Tuesdays through Fridays for lunch and dinner; weekends for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $4.50-$17.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/28/faustina	Faustina	25 Cooper Sq. 	40.7278238	-73.9908953	212-475-3400	2010/06/28	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="140" word_count="140">The patio at Faustina, in the Cooper Square Hotel, is an exceptionally nice place to eat dinner. The tables are made of sturdy, weathered wood; a fence screens out the street; green bushes and tall umbrellas give the feeling of an oasis. Recently, on a warm almost-summer night, at one table, a group of out-of-towners were discussing their itinerary: “Where’s the hip place nowadays? I always enjoyed the CBGBs”; another table chattered in an unidentified Eastern European language. The service is chipper, even conspiratorial. “I’ll be back, and we can talk some food,” the waiter announced. “Awesome!” greeted an order of soft-shell crab. “I want to come join you guys.” Later, describing the proper method for dunking grilled ciabatta into a cast-iron skillet full of poached duck egg and <em>fonduta</em>, he advised, “Get crazy, no one’s watching!” </p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">Unfortunately, his enthusiasm seemed a bit misplaced. The crab was perfectly nice—with lots of tender meat inside crispy claws—but not exactly a revelation. Nor were the short ribs, with spaetzle and horseradish; or the chewy olive-oil-poached octopus. The grilled ciabatta was delicious and gooey, but the charred crusts of the bread detracted from pure enjoyment. A lobster risotto was disconcertingly green and its flavors muddled; red snapper was a little overcooked, and the only contribution made by an underlying layer of artichokes was a jarring note of bitterness, and a beautifully cooked piece of veal was overshadowed by a too-sweet sauce. “It tastes like apple butter,” a diner complained.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">As so often happens, dessert came as a bit of culinary redemption, if with dated presentation—swooping arcs of chocolate; pointless strips of <em>gelée</em>. The Chocolate Carmellina had the sweet crunch of a candy bar; a lemon cheesecake was light, frothy, and exquisitely citrusy, with a scoop of redundant lemon sorbet on top. Unfortunately, however, dessert also arrived with an apologetic resettlement: to placate the neighbors, who have been famously opposed to the hotel and its occasionally rambunctious guests, the management has agreed to move everyone inside at the designated hour, ten o’clock on weekdays, eleven on Fridays and Saturdays. Suddenly, blissful sanctuary gives way to a listless, lifeless room, all metal tones and obtrusive cherry-red leather accent pillows. Get the check, and get out of there fast, before the good vibes fade away. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $16-$37.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/14/pies-n-thighs	Pies ’N’ Thighs	166 S. 4th St., Brooklyn 	40.7112166	-73.9613451	347-529-6090	2010/06/14	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="110" word_count="110">The first Pies ’n’ Thighs opened in the spring of 2006, a tiny kitchen in the back of a dive bar on Kent Street that produced no-frills barbecue for a scattering of picnic tables almost directly under the Williamsburg Bridge. The place closed in 2008, after the Department of Health arrived at an unsympathetic assessment of the setup, but you can still form an idea of its reputation among the local cognoscenti by looking at user reviews on Yelp: “I stayed in an abusive relationship with my former landlord just so I could be in Williamsburg near you.” Now the restaurant has reopened in a pleasant corner location a few minutes away.</p><p data-wc="193" word_count="193">The new premises preserve an informal, even makeshift feel—eclectic vintage furniture, gingham-patterned vinyl tablecloths, drinks in plastic beakers, ad-hoc hand-drawn signage—but the restaurant is now distinctly grownup. There are three seating areas: a diner-style one near the kitchen, an airy, barnlike room behind, and, between the two, some outdoor tables. The star of the menu is the fried chicken, with a batter both perfectly crisped and richly succulent; the chicken inside is brined, tender, and cooked not a moment too long. A grittier breading, almost eggshell-like, covering a pungent dry-fried catfish, is no less successful. Side dishes include hush puppies—pert, crunchy, and sinful—but the kitchen also obtains some fine results in other items without resorting to calorific overload: a tart cucumber salad with lightly vinegared tomatoes and onions, and smoky collard greens, boiled with small hunks of pork. Biscuits arrive with a luxurious golden crust on the outside and a gooey, doughy center. By comparison, pulled pork and beef brisket are unexceptional, the flavor pleasant but lacking definition. What’s more, the pork comes in a cruelly fragile bun, which leaves you cupping fistfuls of meat and disintegrating bread.</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">Great care goes into the production of a constantly changing array of pies, which range from seasonal (rhubarb) to downright outré (guava cheesecake). Key-lime pie is the staple, its citrus tang wonderfully matched against a graham-cracker crust, for which Sarah Buck is said to make her own graham crackers to pound to smithereens. (Buck, who is married to the <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer Kelefa Sanneh, is a co-owner of the restaurant, as well as its pastry chef.) The place is generally full of youngish Williamsburg types with beards and assertive eyewear, and enough plaid shirts to make you think you’ve ended up in the Appalachians.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/07/the-mark-restaurant	The Mark Restaurant	25 E. 77th St. 	33.52467	-101.9170129	212-606-3030	2010/06/07	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="107" word_count="107">At Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s new hotel restaurant, as one moves from lobby to lounge to dining room, the décor passes through the animal kingdom: zebra, pony, tiger. The patrons sport their own exotic attire of furs and feathers (although, unlike males in the wild, the men tend toward the ordinary; suit jackets abound). So what if the menu is more petting zoo than safari? At the Mark, spectacle generally trumps taste, or at least preëmpts it. “I want to eat this up,” a woman at the bar recently cooed to her companion. She meant the shiny amoeba-shaped bar itself, which cast a fetching orange glow.</p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">Vongerichten has proclaimed that the Mark presents his take on “comforting, everyday food,” but, as might be expected from the man who brought us foie-gras brûlée, it is a decidedly luxe version. The Upper East Side clientele has been kept firmly in mind, as has Vongerichten’s genial credo, “A cuisine to suit every taste.” A tasty tuna tartare is served with “niçoise flavors” and “gaufrette potatoes”—in other words, olive slices and potato chips. Choices are sometimes made more complicated than they ought to be: a waiter flummoxed diners recently when she asked how the table would like black sea bass cooked (medium rare was suggested, after a beat or two). Sweet pea soup is a performance on a plate: the Parmesan foam over which it is poured bubbles up, lava-like, under the appreciative gaze of the entire table. Smoked-salmon pizza with an “everything” crust proved to be a rare misstep—the bagel-and-lox-inspired dish had clearly wandered across the Park from its rightful home on the Upper West Side. </p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">It’s hardly a surprise that the humble is often less successful than the flamboyant. When the waiter brings out the dessert tray, it’s best to skip the dreary recitation and go for the Grand Marnier soufflé—a showstopper of a dish, studded with chunks of bittersweet chocolate. But perhaps dessert dulls the survival instinct. On a recent night, the aroma of something burning wafted in, mysteriously, from the direction of the raw bar. The creatures continued to graze contentedly, unfazed. (Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and weekends for breakfast, brunch, and dinner.

Pizzacone	325 Fifth Ave., at 33rd St. 	null	null	null	2010/05/31	<p data-wc="170" word_count="170">Though there’s no want of diversity in the annals of New York pizza, anyone weary of Ray’s, Joe’s, and Lombardi’s can find novelty at Pizzacone. The shop, located down the hill from the Empire State Building, covers uncharted ground between a tri-corner slice and a Hot Pocket—rolled, but not sealed, over. (Bagel Bites are a separate matter.) Here’s how it works: Every morning, a Queens bakery molds pizza dough into the shape of an ice-cream cone before baking it in a specially designed oven and delivering it to midtown. Once you order, your preferred sauce (red or pesto) is squirted into the cone and smeared around its interior. Cheese and other ingredients, chosen from a standard list, are tossed in a bowl, like at a salad place, and stuffed inside. Then it’s two minutes in the oven, another one in your hand—a near-mandatory cooling period—and, finally, dozens of nibbles, more cautious but otherwise similar to a cartoon rabbit gnawing a carrot.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">Pizzacone is the brainchild of Ingo Pinto, a Portuguese émigré who likes to brag that he’s given New York the capacity to eat pizza one-handed—a dubious achievement, on several levels. Though pizza cones facilitate the merger of eating and, say, hailing a cab, they impede book-reading—you can’t put the cone down. Such mechanical defects nettle. As you work your way down, you realize that the bottom of the cone retains all the heat, and worries persist that the sizzling gloop will leak onto your lap. The dough, perhaps by structural necessity, nears cardboard heavy. That every bite tastes like run-of-the-mill pizza isn’t the most upsetting drawback. Paying a premium to eat a cone of pizza in the nucleus of touristdom makes even the most confident native feel like a chump.</p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">During a recent lunch hour, over the pulsation of Música Popular Brasileira, gawks outnumbered guests. Pinto stood behind the counter with a broad smile, hoping to entice curious passersby with “It’s super-delicious!” and “The four-cheese pesto? My favorite!” A diner, polishing off a cone of sausage, mushroom, and mozzarella, couldn’t decide if he was full. “It’s O.K. to have two slices of pizza,” his friend said. “But who has two cones of anything?” Pinto, undeterred, announced, “I have another invention coming. You just wait and see!” Skeptical eyes await. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Pizza cones $3.60-$5.50.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

It is a place fit for a firebird or a frog princess, and fantastic even from the sidewalk. Daffodils and tulips, crowding birdcages, spill over plant tables draped with embroidered shawls. Inside, starry chandeliers cast a blush glow over a profusion of bric-a-brac: doilies, candy dishes, watering cans stuffed with pussy willows. Men are drinking champagne. Women are gnawing on great sprigs of scallion, smearing dill butter on brown bread. “Waiting for Katia” reads a sign, framed in gilt and propped on a reserved table, as though a story, extravagant and heroic, is about to begin. The windows are open, and the breeze smells like hyacinth.</p><p data-wc="235" word_count="235">Mari Vanna—which is owned by the Ginza Project, proprietors of seventy restaurants in Russia—offers all sorts of vodka: beet, coffee, cranberry, pineapple, lemon, horseradish. Plum is a bit pruney. Seaberry has a fluoride-rinse tinge. An infusion of cherry helps the medicine go down quick. Munch on pretzel-like <em>sushki</em>, “little dry things”—Russians give them to teething babies—while contemplating the Martini list. The cucumber version tastes like pickle juice, but the cranberry one, bobbing with rubies, is a nice pick. “Irene?” a businessman says to a bartender. “Oh, Irina.” The scene is starting to pick up. To begin, have <em>pirozkhi</em>, glistening buns stuffed with cabbage, and <em>okroshka</em>, a tart yogurt soup laden with hard-boiled quail eggs and ham—a liquid Cobb salad. The portions are huge. A fork leaves furrows in carrot cakes like the tracks of a plow. A geyser of butter shoots from the chicken Kiev. Smoked fatback, served on a cutting board in the shape of a cow, looks almost like sushi, pale and immaculate. If snow maidens ate bacon, this would be it. Over by the bathroom, where the faucet is a samovar, people are waiting, loose and talkative. A rotary phone, mounted on the wall, almost brings a man of a certain age to tears. When he was a child, he had one just like it. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for dinner. Entrées $15-$36.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

On a rough-hewn table, a shrine to greenmarket produce is lit like a Vermeer. There’s a rooftop garden, mismatched china, and waiters wearing thrift-store plaid. It’s enough to make you think you’re in Brooklyn. But while the vegetables are organic, the atmosphere is canned—a seductive advertisement for the boho-chic appurtenances sold at ABC Carpet &amp; Home. The menu, printed with soy-based ink, boasts of “bread baskets handcrafted by the indigenous Mapuche people of Patagonia” and spices that “represent the stories of our global diversity.” For $495, plus tax, that Steelwood dining chair can be imported to your own apartment, where, rest assured, it’s “destined to become more soulful over time.”</p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">All this might seem a little phony, or, worse, crass, but a bite of peekytoe-crab toast ought to stifle your concerns: buttery, salty, with a trace of fennel, it was a brilliant riff on boardwalk cuisine. Then there was the transcendent pea soup, whose minty broth, with whole peas and plump islands of fried sourdough, upgraded a dish that too often recalls baby food. Chitarra pasta, with morels, goat cheese, and lemon, was a perfect distillation of spring, at once earthy and bright. There’s pizza, too, of course, with seasonal toppings. (Can you procure a restaurant license without a pizza oven these days?) A recent special pie—clams, mint, parsley, and chilies—was easily outdone by a wintrier option, with kale, ricotta, tomato sauce, and sausage. The former was much too dry, as was an entrée of arctic char, served on a pile of pretty but arid romanesco. Your server may steer you, instead, toward the black sea bass with potatoes and spinach, whose varied flavors and textures—spicy, citrusy, crisp, tender, starchy, vegetal—made for a nearly flawless course.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">If you seek the staff’s advice, and heed it, you’re likely to enjoy a very good meal; the service is even more consistent than the food. Not long ago, a side of soggy, uneaten greens caught the attention of a server, who alerted the chef, who informed the manager, who had the offending item stricken from the check. Such gestures inspire generous moods, and it’s easy to forget, in spite of yourself, that you’re dining in an elegantly appointed food court. (Open daily for dinner.

It must be the rent. The space, a honeycombed chamber on the ground floor of Lever House, Gordon Bunshaft’s famous Park Avenue skyscraper, is either the principal attraction (if its airporty weirdness appeals) or the primary problem (if the weirdness does not, and if the premium therefore grates). The other night, the restaurant’s landlord, the developer Aby Rosen, was having dinner with a big, elegant-looking group at the restaurant’s north end, under a canopy of silvery balloons that read, “Happy Birthday, George.” The waiter was unable or unwilling to serve up a surname. “He is Important George,” he said. But he did cheerfully recite the names of the personages in a set of giant Warhol silk screens along the wall, from Rosen’s Lever House Art Collection. Nureyev, Stallone, Iran’s Empress Farah, Jerry Hall—by invoking midtown dining’s haut-transgressive past, they serve, unwittingly, as a rebuke to its slick present. The spiciest thing at Casa Lever may be the breadsticks.</p><p data-wc="190" word_count="190">The owners of Sant Ambroeus, a chain of self-satisfied Europhilic cafés, took over the Lever House space last fall. The atmosphere is more subdued than it was, and so is the food, although it would be misleading to call either recessionized. The menu leans Italian, northern. The finest things, it seems, are the simplest, like the veal Milanese, which strikes the perfect balance, rare among schnitzels, of breading and meat, and the grilled Dover sole, which derives its slim verve from a vein of Dijon. The Bolognese is quiet—in a good way. Pomegranate seeds and lime gently tart up a raw-bar appetizer of hamachi, and a lemony dressing does the same to a salad of arugula and sliced artichoke. More complicated, perhaps, is the feeling that arises when one gazes for hours at the racks containing bottles of Brunello, Barolo, Barbaresco, <em>eccetera</em>, <em>eccetera</em>, that divide the banquettes, and wonders how much money and time, not to mention hepatocytes, would be required to try them all—the answer being, alas: more than most of us, however Important, have.

Chef Sebastien Agez.” Pawlicki has taken his talents across town to tend to his new fondue place, Taureau, in the East Village, but the canonical <em>cuisine à la campagne</em> at La Sirène remains.</p><p data-wc="284" word_count="284">The décor supports the siren theme loosely, at best—slightly dingy walls, painted canary yellow, crimson, and cobalt, randomly hung with nautical ephemera and <em>mosaics de la mer</em>. The high prices (compensating, in part, for the B.Y.O.B. policy) are mitigated by how seriously the food is taken, and by the generous portions. <em>Escargots à la Bourguignonne</em> (“1/2 dozen in the Shell!” the menu exclaims) arrive on an etched silver plate, with gorgeous matching tongs, elevating the experience of imbibing copious pools of garlic butter. The truffled goat-cheese tart is oversized and oozy, with an exemplary <em>pâte brisée</em>. Mussels are offered with several thyme-infused sauces; the piquant curried cream and apples in the <em>moules Rochelaises</em> are straight out of M. F. K. Fisher. Entrées are stalwart. <em>Hachis parmentier de la mer</em>, a kind of shepherd’s pie, comes stuffed with cod, pollack, and Swiss cheese, covered by browned and crispy mashed potatoes. Elegant sliced duck breast is brightened by a sour-cherry reduction and a demure square of sweet-potato gratin. Agez, formerly of Café des Artistes, turns out a mean cassoulet: a prodigious pot studded with duck confit, pork sausage, and garlicky white beans. The pièce de résistance, tournedos Rossini, is a wicked combo of seared beef filet and foie gras, bathed in a port-wine reduction, placed atop a single toasted crouton. Apparently owing to customer protest when they disappeared, the profiteroles have returned to the menu (“This isn’t Hershey’s Chocolate, but Callebaut!”), but the <em>fondant au chocolat noir</em> and the <em>choux Chantilly</em> are nice, too. Oh, and one more thing: “No Room @ Sirene, Ask for Taureau, 212-228-2222 (BYO).” (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $23.75-$33.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/04/26/recette	Recette	328 W. 12th St. 	29.7924107142857	-95.4004672857143	212-414-3000	2010/04/26	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="115" word_count="115">The concept of small plates is a nice one: you get to share a bunch of things and maybe spend a little less money. In practice, you rarely get the table space to accommodate all those dishes, or a staging of courses that is precise enough to keep flavors from getting muddied and food from getting cold, or, once the waiter suggests two or three items per diner, the diminutive bill that you hoped for. Still, at Recette, which took over the Jarnac space in the West Village, the opportunity to range over the inventive menu is welcome, even if you wind up employing balletic skill to keep a plate from sliding into your lap. </p><p data-wc="208" word_count="208">The chef, Jesse Schenker, combines long lists of ingredients—one item included “roasted scallop, cockles, white asparagus, cipollini onion marmalade, fresh peas, green peppercorn sauce”—to subtle effect. The hamachi crudo employed crescents of orange uni, slivers of jalapeño, and segments of blood orange that accentuated the flavor of the fish without overshadowing it. Little globes of skinned cherry tomatoes, which accompanied the perfectly cooked branzino, looked like balls of sorbet, and had the concentrated flavor of imminent summer. Generously portioned dishes of foie gras, roasted and glazed with agrodolce, and crispy sweetbreads, crowned with capers, ably justified indulgence. A slice of pork belly, not nearly as fatty as that cut tends to be, was compelling enough that the tempura rock shrimp perched atop it was merely a distraction. Even side dishes deserved full attention: duck-fat-roasted fingerlings paired richness with a wafting of fresh parsley; sweet, tender spring vegetables were refreshed with mint. After so many savory dishes that make complexity look full of ease, the desserts feel oddly overwrought. A reinterpretation of s’mores—spicy chocolate sauce, toasted marshmallow, and graham-cracker ice cream—lacked crunch to offset the gooeyness; a passionfruit “tart”—an intensely flavored curd atop crumbled pastry—was far too conceptual to be satisfying. </p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">The new occupants have turned the room into something of a French country inn, with green walls, botanical prints and still-life paintings of flower arrangements, and big white windows that open out onto the street. The restful feel of the room is undercut by some claustrophobia, though, and, one recent warm evening, a group of diners in the back corner longed for a breeze. The staff enacts careful pas de deux around the tables, and, as the waitress informed a patron the other night, stronger coffee had to be sacrificed for space. “We had espresso when we first opened,” she said. “But two people got burned the first week.” (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

In a neighborhood often known for being image-conscious, Village Tart is remarkably unassuming; it may be the only place within a mile radius that amiably deploys Jack Johnson as background music. The other night, the mellow decorum of a crowded dining room was disturbed only by a boisterous conversation that touched on, among other things, the iPad, the relative beauty of two sisters, and female anatomy. “Let’s be honest,” asserted one voice. “I’m a really smart guy who knows a lot about a lot of things, but that’s one thing I’ve never figured out.”</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">While the menu may lack the culinary pyrotechnics the consulting chef, Pichet Ong, one of a cohort of pastry-makers gone savory, has displayed elsewhere, most dishes succeed through a careful attention to detail. Bacon-wrapped dates countered sweetness with red-pepper flakes, and a supersized pig in a blanket—a Kobe-beef sausage wrapped in delicate phyllo dough—was rich in flavor, though, a server admitted, a bit intimidating in its heft. Both a vivid salad of red and yellow beets, with Greek yogurt, oranges, and candied pistachios, and the kobacha-and-coconut soup, sprinkled with cookie crumbs, offered the creamy satisfaction usually found in dessert. Entrées tend toward comfort: a silky buttermilk-poached halibut demonstrated the benefits of letting the fish assert its own personality; a chicken potpie, topped with an ample pastry crust, was rich without being overwhelmingly meaty. </p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">Ong seems to assume a more hands-on role in the restaurant than his title might imply—the other evening, he was there, shuttling between the kitchen and the dining room—and it would be a shame to visit Village Tart without having dessert. On offer recently: cigar-size cannoli filled with nougat semifreddo; an inventive combination of grapefruit and butterscotch; and a brownie-like chocolate skillet torte with a swoop of marshmallow across the top. And then, finally, there’s a glimpse of the flirt behind the name: affogato, served “adult.” (Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $12-$20.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/04/12/romans	Roman’s	243 DeKalb Ave., Brooklyn 	40.6896345	-73.9695384199658	718-622-5300	2010/04/12	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="136" word_count="136">This new spot, from the mini-moguls behind the Brooklyn restaurants Marlow &amp; Sons, Diner, and Bonita (a branch of which formerly occupied this space), has a first-New-York-apartment affect: rickety-looking wooden chairs, with green padded seats; chipped, painted floors; the hothouse sensation of radiators run amok. That many of the guests seem to be friends of the staff, or neighbors in for their weekly supper, gives it the happy hecticness of a house party. The menu changes daily, and there’s a sense that you could come back often and rarely get bored, if never exactly excited. “I came here the other night with my mom,” said one diner, arriving the other evening to sit at the bar with a magazine. “It wasn’t amazing, but it was good enough that I wanted to come back by myself.” </p><p data-wc="186" word_count="186">Roman’s credo seems to be that high-quality ingredients don’t require much improvement in order to taste good. It works best in the appetizers and the pastas—smaller plates that, when shared, as a waiter recommended, give you a couple of perfect bites. On recent visits, a base of buttery toast was an excellent underpinning for a heap of tender borlotti beans and sharp Parmesan, and for a mound of creamy, just firm stracciatella cheese. A salad of beets and grapefruit delivered a nice interplay between sweet and bitter; a tangle of spaghetti and preserved tuna, with a hint of lemon, was full of subtle grace. The meatier entrées, though, suffered a bit from their simplicity. Roasted lamb shoulder was aromatic and tenderly cooked, but with little in the way of complicated flavors, and its accompanying turnips were distinguished only by their saltiness. A huge slab of steak, also roasted, was notable mostly for the braised escarole draped over it like a toupee, and for the bloodiness of its center. (It did, however, provide a nice big bone to take home to the dog.)</p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">The studied amateurishness of the atmosphere infects the service in slightly annoying ways. Trying to help a table select a wine, a waiter offered two ambiguous adjectives: “fleshy” and “funky.” Inquiring about the provenance of the meat elicited a look of disdain, as if it should be unnecessary to have to say that it was locally sourced. If you want to join the party, it seems, you’d better know the host. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner. Entrées $16-$24.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/04/05/le-caprice	Le Caprice	795 Fifth Ave., at 61st St. 	null	null	null	2010/04/05	<p class="no-indent" data-wc="115" word_count="115">The gleaming black lacquer that dominates this new Fifth Avenue spot reflects a current vogue for mid-century swank. Indeed, the Pierre Hotel, where the restaurant is housed, has capitalized on its role as the site of extra-office trysts on the period drama “Mad Men” by offering a “Mad Affair” package—for $1,150, you get a night in a suite and some DVDs of the show. (“Retro attire is encouraged.”) Playing along, Le Caprice, a stuffy take on a sceney London institution, boasts a piano by the coat check, Jean Shrimpton’s picture on the walls, waistcoats and white aprons, and Singapore Slings. As on “Mad Men,” however, meticulous appearances mask trouble; Lutèce this is not.</p><p data-wc="162" word_count="162">While you’re waiting to be seated, you may be tempted by one of those nostalgic cocktails. Don’t be: they’re as cloying as the Disney ballads tinkling out of the piano. One evening, a salad of burrata, romaine, lobster, and tomatoes was flavorful but texturally cacophonous. Likewise, the haddock tart was at once runny and lumpy—thin chowder spilled over a pastry shell. Gingery sashimi (garnished with petals that might have fallen from the very orchids decorating the room) cried out for some acidity, and the same problem plagued a supposedly medium-rare loin of yellowfin, which was as gray as a flannel suit. The accompanying lentils only made the dish drearier. Minty mashed peas, on the other hand, refreshed the well-executed fish and chips. Another standby, the steak tartare, was faultlessly familiar, and the “small” portion would more than fill a lowball glass. Cap the meal with a sublime treacle pudding and you could almost excuse the kitchen’s blunders.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The service, though, is unforgivable. On recent visits, it ranged from hostile to bumbling to nonexistent. After checking in with the hostess, a diner was chased down by a suspicious employee who seemed to feel she didn’t belong. A bartender recited, unprompted, the ingredients of every cocktail on the menu, as if to prove he knew them. A waiter, preoccupied with a former “Saved by the Bell” star at a nearby table, briefly materialized only to sweep away a third-full bottle of wine. When asked to leave it, he froze. “It’s not a scam!” he protested. At these prices, one might beg to disagree. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $18-$45.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/29/a-voce-columbus	A Voce Columbus	10 Columbus Circle, 3rd floor 	null	null	null	2010/03/29	<p class="noindent" data-wc="157" word_count="157">In 2008, for Valentine’s Day, the Obamas went out for a “date night” at Spiaggia, an Italian restaurant in Chicago, where the wood-roasted scallops were Barack’s favorite dish. This year, they spent the holiday at Camp David, which was just as well. Missy Robbins, Spiaggia’s prized chef, had moved on to New York to run A Voce. The second in a chainlet owned by a company called MARC (according to the restaurant’s Web site, it “maintains offices in London, New York and Greenwich, Connecticut” and “seeks to become a world-respected portfolio of iconic destination restaurants and associated food businesses”), A Voce Columbus, a steel-and-glass box of a room on the third floor of Time Warner Center, is as corporate as it gets. This is not a bad thing. Nobody wants an artisanal car or a quirky airport, so why make a fetish of idiosyncrasy in food and the people we pay to prepare it? </p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153"> A Voce has its pleasures: light, space, cheery if scripted service—“I’m sorry to be inhospitable,” a host said, before refusing to seat an incomplete party, and, then, hospitably, thinking the better of it. It’s a Fresh Air Fund of a restaurant, inducing in New Yorkers the comfort and boredom they would feel in Scottsdale or Charlotte. That is not to say it’s not big time: the ’nduja pork sausage is as creamy as pesto, and an appetizer of trumpet mushrooms, sliced and roasted, melds the sweetness of a pear with the heft of a steak. The menu is sophisticated. There’s tortellini in brodo, in a capon broth. There’s spaghetti alla chitarra, a dream-team dish of crab, leeks, and sea urchins, which, here as elsewhere, doesn’t taste as snappy as it sounds. Butternut-squash mezzaluna, refreshingly, is stuffed with Taleggio, not ricotta. Food comes hot. Glasses stay filled. </p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120"> One night, Sarah Silverman, with a strapped-on backpack, piled into a big leather booth with friends, including Matthew Broderick. But Robbins, a prudent chief executive, isn’t taking any risks. Olives and raisins are nonentities in the baccalà. Scallops, supposedly with pink peppercorn, have all the kick of saltines. For certain occasions—celebrating a merger or a successful attempt at finding one’s way back to the Mandarin Oriental after a carriage ride in Central Park—A Voce is an ideal restaurant. Just don’t try, as Barack Obama did nineteen years ago at Gordon’s, in Chicago, to sneak a ring onto the dessert plate. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/22/corsino	Corsino	637 Hudson St. 	42.3561888	-83.0837728	212-242-3093	2010/03/22	<p class="noindent" data-wc="130" word_count="130">When you stand at the bar at Corsino waiting for a table to open up, you wonder why restaurants ever fail. Yes, it can be a tough business, but looking around at the chattering throng of youngish, casually affluent people here, success seems easy. It’s just a matter of finding a nice location and creating a menu of Italian food that accommodates both snackers and hungrier folk, at prices that aren’t high but which mount quickly if diners are tempted to graze over the menu tapas-style. Throw in a good wine list, upscale ingredients that don’t require intensive kitchen work (cheese plates, charcuterie), and a couple of “interesting” types of offal or some unusual regional items to impress the foodies, and bingo!—a license to print money. </p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">If there’s a master of this approach, it’s surely Jason Denton, whose bite-size endeavors include ’ino (panini and wine), ’inoteca (wine and panini), collaborations with Mario Batali, and cookbooks focussing on sandwiches and antipasti. His new restaurant, a couple of blocks south of the meatpacking district’s epicenter, follows this pattern, with a smattering of larger dishes. One recent evening, crostini juxtaposed flavors unexpectedly—Brussels-sprout leaves mixed with sharp Pecorino cheese, eggplant with a twang of mint—as did antipasti: roasted squash came with pomegranate seeds and <em>guanciale</em>, the one quenching the salt of the other. Panini were definitely the restaurant’s most successful area. Tongue and <em>testa</em>, which melted into the bread like cheese, was sweetened by a homemade pear mustard. And the Roman specialty saltimbocca was arguably improved by becoming a sandwich filling. A couple of slices of bread were exactly what such rich ingredients (veal, prosciutto, sage, butter) needed. </p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">The best main courses were essentially overgrown starters: two whiplashes of blackened octopus over potatoes <em>all’amatriciana</em>, skewers of medium-rare tuna with deep-fried capers. But then a friend diffidently remarked, “Just for the record, this lamb’s inedible.” Not quite, perhaps, but further investigation revealed an indifferent bit of meat that had been taken to the brink of overcooked. Execution wasn’t the only problem: the accompanying radicchio and chickpeas were too cloyingly sweet to be consumed in anything but tiny quantities. A pork osso bucco with fennel was better conceived but also poorly prepared. The underlying problem is surely that snacks, with their bold flavor contrasts and doses of salt, don’t scale naturally into meals. Corsino hasn’t quite made the leap, but it may not need to. The appetizers and sandwiches are good, the entrées not. Order accordingly. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dishes $2.50-$18.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/15/colicchio-sons	Colicchio & Sons	85 Tenth Ave., at 15th St. 	null	null	null	2010/03/15	<p class="noindent" data-wc="152" word_count="152">Tom Colicchio closed his Craftsteak flagship in New York earlier this fall and vowed to make its revamp personal: he’d be there, behind the stove, doing what he loves to do. The other night, a waiter confirmed that Colicchio was indeed wearing his whites most evenings, including this one. The room itself hasn’t changed much—greens replace beiges, flowers replace slabs of pink salt rock—nor has the clientele, though you sense that more than a few diners are drawn as much by the owner’s “Top Chef” celebrity as by the food. One table grilled their waiter about Colicchio’s family—did he really have sons? (Yes, two: Dante and Luka.) The recent shift to a prix-fixe menu might reflect the ratio of gawkers to gourmands; it’s to encourage people to order courses rather than share, the waiter confided. “I hate to say we’re twisting arms, but . . .”</p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">Unfortunately, Colicchio seems to have become a bit sloppy in the kitchen. Most everything was fine, but only that. A first course of gnocchi offered succulent doses of bone marrow but was unevenly seasoned, giving the middle of the dish a peppery burst and leaving the outer fringes bland. The agnolotti, packets of lemony white-bean purée, came with spongy chunks of octopus and extraneous cubes of chorizo. The loup de mer was nicely cooked, but a stray piece of foil betrayed its method of preparation; the venison, at least, had no major drawbacks, aided by some buttery trumpet mushrooms. </p><p data-wc="227" word_count="227">In the front room, now called the Tap Room, a cozier, more casual atmosphere is reflected in the à-la-carte menu. The chanterelle-nettle-and-cacciatorini pizza offered warm, complicated flavors that made up for the doughy crust; a heaping mound of ricotta, drizzled with truffle honey and topped with roasted root vegetables, was deliciously creamy. The wheel of porchetta—pork in the center, surrounded by a ring of chorizo, bound by a layer of fat—was disappointingly drab, despite the best efforts of the chorizo to sear the tongue into submission. But the baked rigatoni with duck drew a pleasant gamy richness from the fowl, balanced by the slightly bitter kick of cavalo nero. The end of the meal deserved full attention; the pastry chef, Stephen Collucci, who supplies both rooms, has a winsome way of combining sweet and sour and salty. A white-chocolate cheesecake with an almost whipped texture was accompanied by tart spiced pineapple; a parfait mixed bittersweet chocolate and peanut-butter-crunch ice cream with bits of pretzel. Frying here is almost an art: greaseless, tender beignets, coconut-cream doughnuts, and nearly bite-size zeppole, folded into a napkin, which come with smooth lemon curd for dipping. If this were, say, a cooking competition, Colicchio might move on to the next round, but Collucci would win it all. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dining-room prix fixe $78; Tap Room plates $8-$24.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

At the Grill, witticisms proliferate. There’s a Million Dollar chicken and a Demi-Vache rib eye. The High Line Fling pairs a spiked-punch bowl with straws for the table. The Deal Closer, a dessert in the form of a vat of chocolate mousse, presumably refers to a subject more stimulating than real estate. When the waiters, dressed in matching plaid pants and waistcoats, forget to take your drink order, dally with bringing the bread, and generally dematerialize, this is known as a Standardelay.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">Last summer, disrobed guests at the nineteen-story hotel, which straddles the High Line, reportedly displayed their nakedness to the park-goers below. In the restaurant the other night, the revealing ensembles that passed for clothing remained intact, and voyeuristic opportunities were limited to bathrooms that seemed unisex, until you realized, too late, that they weren’t. Up front, a leggy hostess turned out to be Stacy Ann, erstwhile of “America’s Next Top Model,” who explained that, your reservation and the empty tables notwithstanding, a seat in the main room (red leather banquettes, dim lighting, OSHA-friendly noise level) was a two-hour wait. Otherwise, it’s you and your date at a circular four-top in the front, which is really another eatery altogether—a brasserie setup, loud as a boxing match and bright as the snow falling outside. The time was 6:45 <small>P.M.</small>, and, the waiter disclosed, “We’re already full of drunk people.”</p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">Counterintuitively, the food here isn’t a postscript, though the chef, Dan Silverman, misses as often as he hits. Keenly constructed appetizers such as the charred octopus and the cauliflower soup topped with trout roe and a creamy soft-poached egg were undermined by the likes of smashed potatoes flash-fried in duck fat—“out of this world,” according to the waiter, but, in essence, a cafeteria’s greasy spuds. Proteins including lamb chops, filet mignon, and swordfish managed a refined and tasty simplicity, but a shell-on lobster stew proved distressingly messy and, worse, bland. Nearby, a waiter announced the arrival of a plate of Italian sea bass with, “Here’s the branzino—or is it Bronzino?” Tuscan fish as Tuscan master. It was, perhaps, the wittiest line of the night.

When Meyer’s boss morphed the word into the subtly different-sounding Maialino, it took weeks for Meyer to notice that he was now being called “little pig.” This self-deprecating story (as told on the restaurant’s Web site) is a sweetly revealing bit of lore that fits comfortably with the affable, food-loving ethos of the Meyer empire, which includes the stalwart Union Square Café, Eleven Madison Park, and the ever-expanding, ever-accessible Shake Shack chain. While Meyer’s warm and fuzzy approach to the Roman trattoria is the atmospheric antithesis to its setting, in the Gramercy Park Hotel—newly renovated by Ian Schrager with George Condo and Richard Prince paintings and a showy Gothic aura—Meyer’s trademark hospitality shines through. The cheery bar up front offers Italian wines by the glass and a way to circumvent the reservation situation in the dining room—tables there are perennially booked, but the bar takes walk-ins only. </p><p data-wc="222" word_count="222">As one has come to expect from Meyerino, the food, served with a relaxed, knowing smile, is usually delicious, occasionally spectacular. Start with the <em>grande selezione di salumi</em>, with its dizzying array of cold sliced pork: three kinds of prosciutto (from Emilia-Romagna, San Daniele, and Iowa), a couple of respectable salamis from Berkeley, and a fine Long Island City soppressata (who knew?). The artichokes in the <em>carciofini fritti</em> have a mineral brininess, and the sauce of anchovy, bread, and lemon turns it into a bracing dish. <em>Lardo</em> tops tiny bruschetta, satisfying with a liberal sprinkle of sea salt. Comfort comes in a bowl of <em>stracciatella alla romana</em>, which is not vanilla-chocolate-chip gelato but a rich chicken broth striated with wisps of cooked egg. The pastas are daydream-worthy, especially the <em>tonnarelli cacio e pepe</em>, long tagliatelle-like noodles bound with pepper and Pecorino that turns to a cream sauce when it hits the noodles. <em>Malfatti al maialino</em> is a good way to get a taste of the signature dish—a huge portion of crispy-skinned suckling pig—without forking over $72. Sheets of pasta commingle with luscious chunks of pork in copious butter, the unctuousness cut with bitter arugula. Meyer, ever generous, gladly validates the little pig in all of us.

Every neighborhood suddenly needed a gastropub, and every gastropub was chockablock with porcine iconography. That the Breslin feels like a particularly successful knockoff—dark leather, dim lighting, and animals everywhere, from pigs and cows, rabbits and stags, to a demonic bull glowering from a Schlitz Malt Liquor sign—might owe something to the fact that Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield, who started the whole trend, are the moving forces here as well. The crowds have migrated, too; one Wednesday night, the bar was packed, the wait for a table stretched to an hour and a half (there are no reservations), and everyone seemed a little frazzled, though there seemed to be a we’re-all-in-it-together brio to the enterprise. Instead of the Spotted Pig’s veneer of British reserve, the Breslin projects a certain swagger; in place of the former’s Pimm’s cup and spiced apple cider, the latter offers cocktails named after albums: Liquid Swords (GZA), Rush of Blood to the Head (Coldplay), Pablo Honey (Radiohead). </p><p data-wc="193" word_count="193">The menu, though, reads a bit like Dickens. Fried head cheese, soup made with bone marrow, pork scratchings, and scrumpets (shredded, fried lamb, shaped like fish sticks): it could be a picnic lunch from “The Pickwick Papers.” Even the pear salad feels hefty, with its crunchy walnuts and thick hunks of Gorgonzola; by contrast, a Brussels-sprout-and-duck salad, laced with Parmesan and pomegranate seeds, seems almost ethereal. The lamb burger ought to be a mandatory order for every table, though most seem to gravitate toward it on their own: medium rare, gamy and tender, on deliciously pillowy bread, topped with just a whisper of feta, every bite tastes a little different, and better, than the one before. The triple-cooked fries have an ultra-crispy exterior and a creamy interior akin to the mashed potatoes that share a plate with the superb smoked pork belly. The pork itself, rich and bacony, inspires gluttony, and maybe a bit of guilt.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/02/08/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote	Le Relais De Venise L’Entrecôte	590 Lexington Ave., at 52nd St. 	null	null	null	2010/02/08	<p class="noindent" data-wc="167" word_count="167">Le Relais de Venise L’Entrecôte may have originated in Paris and be named after Venice, but it feels sort of Swiss, which makes some sense, because Paul Gineste de Saurs, who founded the flagship restaurant, in the Seventeenth Arrondissement, fifty years ago, supposedly took as his inspiration the Café de Paris in Geneva. The paper tablecloths, the lack of ceremony or fuss, the bright lighting, the small wineglasses, the butterless bread, the crisp, bustling reserve of the waitresses, in their black dresses and white aprons (you almost expect them to break out their purses at the end of the meal to make change): it all brings to mind a bare-bones bistro next door to a train station. Because of the first one’s enduring popularity in Paris, the Gineste de Saurs heirs have opened various versions around the world; this one, on a grim stretch of Lexington Avenue, faithfully mimics the original, down to the quick turnover and the cheesy murals of canals and gondoliers.</p><p data-wc="263" word_count="263">Most important, it offers the same menu. You can order but one thing: steak frites, with a green salad. Prix fixe: an anachronistic twenty-four dollars. (A bottle of the company wine, one of just a few on the list, costs about the same.) You indicate how you want your meat cooked, and the waitress draws a matrix on the table, a map of who voted blue, rare, medium, or well done. The salad, topped with walnuts and a mustard vinaigrette, lands with a thud and disappears in a whisper. The steak, coming close on its heels, is an entrecôte, a modest portion cut into slices the shape and size of passport photos, and smeared in Le Relais de Venise’s famous “secret sauce.” A few years ago, <em>Le Monde</em> revealed its ingredients, which, in addition to copious amounts of butter and thyme, allegedly included blanched chicken livers. Mme. Godillot, the owner of the Paris location, denied <em>Le Monde</em>’<em>s</em> claims, telling <em>The Independent</em>, “Our secret remains intact.” On a recent evening, a waitress divulged only that the sauce is imported in a concentrated paste from France. Whatever its components, it overwhelms the meat. This is great if you like thyme, and a bit limiting if you don’t, although the taste grows on you as you distract yourself with the magnificent <em>pommes frites</em>. A second portion arrives. The heart leaps at the sight of a waitress, tongs in hand, offering an extra helping of fries. Yes, please. There will always be room for profiteroles. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

On a recent evening, the occupants of other tables laughed genially as the staff flirted with a pair of young German tourists, teasing them and taking photographs. “Just flip your hair over your shoulder a bit,” the waiter instructed as he raised the camera. Suddenly, everyone was in it together: as a table contemplated tiramisu, one of the German girls leaned over and said, “It’s really good!”</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">A little advice is welcome here, because the menu has a tendency to be hit or miss. The arancini, an appetizer, could almost double as bocce balls; filled with ragù and mozzarella, they had a satisfyingly crunchy exterior and an oozing, savory middle. “Wasn’t the melting cheese inside nice?” the waiter asked solicitously. The caprese salad was perfectly executed, with pert cherry tomatoes (from Sicily, according to the menu) and delicate Campania mozzarella. Swordfish arrived in a huge foil boat, swimming in a tomato-herb broth enriched with clams and mussels; that the fish itself was overcooked was almost forgivable. Judging doneness seems to be an issue in this kitchen: the veal shank, over creamy polenta, was dry and chewy, while a whole branzino was rubbery and overseasoned. The gnocchi were big and doughy, a texture only exacerbated by a cheesy center. An order is enough to make you swear off carbs for at least three days. </p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">The conviviality of the place feels both welcoming—“Please, this your house, stay as long as you want!” a waiter reassured a lingering foursome—and a bit stuffy. Little oddities stand out: the heaters disguised as fireplaces, complete with fake lambent flames, the neutral palette reminiscent of hotel conference rooms, the sample drinks pre-made and sitting on the bar (recently, these included an apple Martini and pomegranate Prosecco). “Do you drink those at the end of the night?” one of the German tourists asked. “I had a little problem with drinking too much, so I just throw them out,” the waiter replied. “Could you throw them out into our mouths?” the girl asked hopefully. For the moment, he demurred, but it seemed like something that could happen. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $15-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

With a pedigree from the mixological mecca Pegu Club, and extensive connections from his years as a food writer, Frizell is poised to become the city’s latest cocktail imperialist. For now, though, his ambitions are decidedly local. As he told <em>Edible Brooklyn</em>, Fort Defiance was conceived as a “place between home and work,” for the denizens of “the most neighborhoody neighborhood in New York.” Indeed, given its lack of subway access, Red Hook can feel charmingly remote; for cinematic purposes, it could play a blue-collar fishing hamlet, or stand in for 1973. On the morning after a blizzard, when the buses are mired in drifts, you may as well get comfortable, because you’re going to be there a while.</p><p data-wc="289" word_count="289">One snowy day last month, with the wainscotting decked in tinsel and fat Christmas bulbs, Fort Defiance felt like just the spot to be waylaid. The aforementioned Breakfast Martini, mixed with gin and marmalade, was bracing and refined, like a hemisphere of grapefruit presented on a silver tray. Use it to wash down a pillowy egg sandwich with Emmentaler cheese, the most satisfying of the brunch options. Pork-potato hash was bland, a Dutch apple pancake seemed oddly puddinglike, and the muffuletta was sabotaged by its flimsy bread. Still, nothing on the menu is unappetizing, and all of it soaks up the booze. Nurse a bourbon-milk punch while you wait for the B61 to get unstuck. Or just linger until five-thirty, when the menu changes; in the winter, brunch sprawls lazily into dusk. By then, there’s no shame in ordering a more traditional Martini (the Vesper, as crisp as Bond’s tuxedo), or a Hemingway Daiquiri, whose peppery bite should vanquish any stigma still attached to such concoctions. But don’t forget the protein: the devilled eggs are flecked with pickled mustard seeds that burst in your mouth like roe. As for entrées, there are only two or three, and they change by the night. Recently, the roast chicken over root vegetables was as well prepared as it was de rigueur, while the shrimp and grits drowned in red-eye gravy. Frizell knows what he’s doing, though. If the food was a little more exciting, Fort Defiance would be mobbed by intrepid inner-borough gourmands. As it is, the grub is just good enough to keep the locals happily in their cups. (Open daily for breakfast and lunch and Wednesdays through Mondays for dinner. Cocktails $8-$10; entrées $15-$18.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Their first, Little Giant, opened on the Lower East Side in 2004. It’s a place go to again and again, even though the food ranges from alluring (it helped launch the devilled-egg renaissance) to inedible (the ramp orecchiette is one of the most stealthily awful dishes around). Tipsy Parson, named for a sherry-drenched sponge-cake trifle—“when saturated with the wine, pour over it a rich boiled custard flavored with what you like and stick blanched almonds thick all over the top,” Mrs. Clement Carrington McPhail, of Richmond, wrote in the “F.F.V. Receipt Book,” in 1894—is blessed with the same appeal. The frozen Concord-grape julep was tongue-paralyzingly sweet, but, hey, it’s a julep. The silverware is vintage. The magnolia wallpaper in the bathroom, set against black lacquer fixtures, is a thing of beauty. Tipsy Parson is the Lady Bird Johnson of restaurants—so superficially charming that it’s genuinely likable. </p><p data-wc="232" word_count="232">Wallach and Gibson really know how to put together a menu: pickled shrimp, pimento cheese, spiced nuts, turkey tails with hot-pepper jelly (more fun to read about than to eat). It is so nice to encounter cheese straws without having to attend a Junior League meeting. Tipsy Parson’s version had a proper kick, as do the hush puppies—another great curatorial call—which were generously, nubbily battered without being too heavy. The ambrosia salad, replete with marshmallows and mandarin oranges, was surprisingly delicate. This is débutante food, though, and some of it is saccharine and fakey. The pork shank, served over a mush of stewed fruit, tasted like it had been sitting in Coca-Cola for days. The Brussels sprouts, with candied pecans and sorghum, were dull and watery. Broiled Rappahannock River oysters with pepper bacon, tarragon vinaigrette, and celery leaves sounded pretty delicious on paper, but were served at an alarming temperature. There is an amazing dessert at Tipsy Parson: the Grasshopper, which is a mint mousse the color of Aquafresh toothpaste, slopped into a Mason jar and buried in cookie crumbles, chocolate custard, and whipped cream. Eat it, and go directly to the dentist. On the way out, grab a business card, lettered in looping cursive on an old manila yard-sale tag. Just precious.

It’s Village bohemian meets Anthropologie catalogue. The tiny room, hardly bigger than a West Fourth Street studio, has perhaps a dozen seats at the bar and only a handful of tables. The owner, Gabriel Stulman, once ran the Little Owl, and, as at that restaurant, the demand entirely exceeds capacity. The difference is that Joseph Leonard doesn’t take reservations, and trying to hang around inside means spending upward of an hour being gently shoved out of the way by the waitresses. </p><p data-wc="145" word_count="145">Stulman has billed the place as “an American brasserie,” which means that the menu offers French-leaning classics: pâté, duck rillettes, mussels and fries. But there’s also shrimp and grits (though you could easily mistake the creamy cornmeal for something more French than Southern) and autumn stuffing, which has deep notes of sage and squash. The meat on the menu is uniformly excellent: steak au poivre, with a nicely seared pepper crust and a tender center, over thin disks of buttery potatoes; braised pork hock, intensely piggy but with the crispy exterior of fried chicken, and offset with a heap of spicy arugula; tender boeuf bourguignonne that separates easily into richly flavored hunks. For comfort food, it would be difficult to do much better than the “soggy toast”: a slab of bread, smothered in oyster mushrooms and pan juices, topped with a poached egg. </p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">The dependability of the menu seems to have drawn a number of regulars, even while the restaurant has maintained its opening buzz, attracting equal measures of Wall Street foodies, sleek young women (“I normally only order salads,” one nervously assured her date when a dish of octopus arrived), and the self-consciously dishevelled. In contrast to the well-executed, stolid food, the atmosphere has a somewhat affected insouciance, from the soundtrack of Jay-Z and Eminem to the oversized line drawing of a leering old man. Outside, a small blackboard offers strenuously saucy come-ons: “Joseph Leonard welcomes you AND YOUR WITTY COMEBACKS so bring it on you sassy minx!!!” (Open Tuesdays through Fridays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/04/sushi-uo	Sushi Uo	151 Rivington St. 	40.71914155	-73.9857354788139	212-677-5470	2010/01/04	<p class="noindent" data-wc="106" word_count="106">It takes guts to open a serious sushi restaurant in a bad economy, all the more so if you’re not Japanese and are only twenty-three years old. But David Bouhadana, who grew up in Florida, of French and Moroccan parentage, clearly has plenty of ambition, as well as an appealing personality and considerable flair with a sushi knife. During the past five years, he has apprenticed with various sushi masters in the States and in Japan. Sushi Uo, his first restaurant, is a tiny operation, just a small sushi bar and a dozen tables, up an unmarked flight of stairs on the Lower East Side.</p><p data-wc="237" word_count="237">The menu features both traditional sushi and more inflected dishes, some of which don’t avoid the vagaries of Asian fusion. Salmon skin—rich, fatty, cooked almost to the consistency of pork rind—worked quite well with wasabi gnocchi, though without convincing you that Italian and Japanese cuisines ought to get together more often. (On another night, the skin made a satisfying combination with a salad of arugula, apple, and pine nuts.) One inventive dish is a so-called tartare, consisting of edamame chopped with shiso and citrus. The preparation foregrounds the beans’ nutty flavor, and is an antidote to all the edamame that one has sucked from salty pods without ever really tasting. Ultimately, though, you sense that unadulterated sushi is Bouhadana’s real interest. His restaurant doesn’t provide the almost intimidating flawlessness of the best midtown sushi temples, but its food’s quality is consistently higher than that of almost any comparably priced establishment and far removed from that of ordinary neighborhood joints, with their cloudy hunks of tuna and cardboardlike eel. Here, tuna is a brilliant, clear red, like stained glass, and eel is soft and pliant. Bouhadana makes subtle tastes register—like the Japanese citron that he zests in microscopic quantities over live scallops—and his presentation is deft: the body of a mackerel, its meat filleted into neat rectangles, is bent back with a bamboo skewer, as if turning in the water. </p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Barking out instructions in Japanese, Bouhadana works with just one sushi assistant and one cook. This probably helps keep prices down, though when the restaurant is full you fear for his sanity, and his fingers. On calmer nights, he holds court for whoever is at the sushi bar, explaining the difficulties of sourcing ingredients, or why he finds mackerel more interesting than tuna belly, or why, when preparing live orange clams, one must not only cut them into strips but fling each piece down dramatically on the counter, where it visibly recoils on impact. Apparently, the jolt causes the muscle fibres, still alive, to tense, giving the clam a new texture, sinewy and strange. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Dishes $4-$15.50; sushi $3-$46.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Actually, everyone does that these days. So add in fluffy pancakes, seared steak and eggs sunny-side-up, smoked salmon layered with avocado on seven-grain, and French toast stuffed with Hatfield ham and Five Spoke Creamery Tumbleweed cheese. And, to make it even more fun, how about letting customers show off their downtown couth by picking Hall &amp; Oates and Barry Manilow tunes via network using their own iPods or iPhones or, in the case of the poor unsavvy saps without, the restaurant’s device? Awesome? Well, perhaps. </p><p data-wc="263" word_count="263">The minuscule, golden-hued space is lined with precarious double-height tables flanked by tall banquettes and bar stools; the walls are covered with glass tiles inlaid with photographs of the New York City subway system, surely indicating a theme. (The logo on the restaurant’s Web site is a clock with knife and fork hands constantly moving: Time flies, but it’s always time for brunch? Brunch never sleeps? Like the subway, the service is good only during prime time?) The food may or may not be worth the wait. The star of “Baked Eggs” turns out to be a three-square-inch cube of meltingly tender short rib that sits solo on one side of the plate, abandoned by the mini-crock of nondescript potato-and-shredded-beef hash topped with two extremely baked eggs. When you order steak and eggs for breakfast, half the satisfaction is in tearing it apart, for full caveman effect. But here it comes sliced for you, and while the meat is well-prepared, the pitiful portion is dwarfed by the hulking slab of ciabatta on which it sits. The biscuits, paired with house-made strawberry jam, however, are as reliable as the Q train, buttery, tender, with a moist crumb, a little crunchy on the outside. The Artisanal Bacon Bar offers varieties—all delicious; it’s bacon, after all—from Texas, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri; at three dollars for two or three little pieces, you have to order at least four kinds to feel indulgent. Beignets, dusted in powdered sugar, cap off the meal just fine—especially if it’s between 11 and 4 on a Sunday. </p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Evenings are another story altogether. The restaurant’s spin on fried chicken and waffles sounds too good to be true, and, one recent rainy sparsely populated night, it was, with a spongy, wheaty waffle and sweet, slightly greasy chicken. In answer to those lonely weeknights, the restaurant recently announced a tweak: it is reincarnating itself as Permanent Brunch and Burger. But if they’re basing their new identity on the wan, undercooked double-patty specimen of a couple weeks ago, here’s hoping they reinvent that, too. (Open daily for brunch and dinner.

Bark is a fierce reproach to the aqueous cart fare of Times Square and Central Park. The dogs here aren’t pinkish-gray or wizened. They’re about seven inches long, too big for their buns, and the ends curl upward to form, if not a smile, at least a knowing smirk. As you bite down, the tensile strength holds for a fleeting second, before a pop and the flow of juices. Besides the mess you make, there is no diner’s remorse: the first sausage makes you ache for the second. Even the veggie dog (potato, apple, and sage, sculpted appropriately) is good enough for you to understand how the vegetarian counter girl justifies working here.</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">Bark is operated by Brandon Gillis and Joshua Sharkey, two chefs who must have been irked by their share of ballgames and cookouts. The guys make most of the topping options themselves, including delicious chili, sauerkraut, and baked beans. The meat underneath is an artisanal amalgam of pork and beef basted in smoked lard butter. (An all-beef dog is available, too.) The enveloping buns—the split-top, lobster-roll variety—are reassuringly warm and crispy. The menu includes a burger (functional), fries and onion rings (spot-on), and specials such as a crispy pork sandwich with spicy coleslaw (overwrought). The sole vestiges from the back-yard gathering are Heinz ketchup, French’s mustard, and lots of alcohol. At Bark, you are as likely to encounter a dude departing with his girl and a growler (sixty-four ounces of beer in a returnable glass jug) as you are a kid with a skateboard and a milkshake.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The atmosphere at Bark is industrial-chic: walls and tables of reclaimed pine, stools of unpolished steel, and hanging lights of an interrogatory mode. As for eco-consciousness, Gillis and Sharkey are not to be outperformed. Table tents, printed on one-hundred-per-cent-recycled paper, tell you things like where the cabbage comes from and that Tri-State Biodiesel regularly collects the kitchen’s grease. Practically everything, from your uneaten food to the plant-derived “plastic” cups, gets composted. The information is interesting, but its presentation verges on self-righteous. A more succinct sign might have conserved further resources: “You and your kind waste a lot.” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Hot dogs $4.25-$7.)  <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/12/07/the-vanderbilt	The Vanderbilt	570 Vanderbilt Ave., Brooklyn 	40.6795908	-73.9683659	718-623-0570	2009/12/07	<p class="noindent" data-wc="110" word_count="110">The name of this new Prospect Heights restaurant implies synonymy with its neighborhood, which, when you are opening up not far from several well-established joints, could easily misfire. Luckily, the co-owner Saul Bolton is a longtime presence in Brooklyn, possessor of one of the borough’s four Michelin-starred eateries, so the feeling as the Vanderbilt took shape in the course of several months was mostly one of eager anticipation. (At least one resident took a dim view, however, complaining online that the new place’s menu concept—small plates—was cribbing from Beast, the tapas spot across the street: “Personally I like to support the original believers in Prospect Heights.”)</p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">The Vanderbilt departs from the homey, carefully worn aesthetic that generally prevails on this strip; the feeling is sleekly industrial and spacious. The long room encompasses a sizable bar area, with vertiginously high stools, stainless-steel light fixtures, and exposed pipes; an open kitchen, with seats at a marble counter where diners can look over the shoulders of the cooks; and a dining room of wood-panelled walls, wooden tables, and hardwood floors. Floor-to-ceiling windows make the street scene as much a part of the décor as the paisley upholstery.</p><p data-wc="280" word_count="280">Bolton and his partner, Ben Daitz, who also runs the Cambodian sandwich shop Num Pang, have given the menu an Asian inflection, and the best dish might be the roasted Brussels sprouts, dressed with sriracha, lime, and honey, each bite a perfect combination of sweet, spicy, and tart. Eating the blistered shishito peppers, on the other hand, was like playing Russian roulette—some were mildly flavorful, others nearly took your tongue off. A more consistent conduit of heat were the Oreilles de Christ: ear-shaped pieces of fried pig’s skin, served with pipettes of pique (a sauce of vinegar, habaneros, fresh pineapple, and cilantro) for accurate seasoning. There was rich charcuterie, including the duck rillets, which offered fatty, smoky respite; <em>boudin blanc</em>, with the thick, rough-hewn appearance of the homemade, had no lack of flavor, or of salt. And the spicy fried chicken wings, a refined version of the bar classic (though still messy), combined perfectly tender meat, a slick of sharp sauce, and a scattering of sesame seeds. Yet, for all the focus on the food, little lacunae in service grated. Plates onto which you served yourself were never changed, muddling the flavors; everything came out in a rush, giving the meal a race-to-the-finish feel. A server brought out a dish of warm doughnuts and, although she was kind enough to tell a diner with a nut allergy that she thought they were made with almond flour, she was inconsiderate enough not to offer the chance to reorder. Still, it was hard to let irritation cloud the fact that those doughnuts, surrounded by a moat of brandied cherries, were light, fluffy, and delicious. (Open daily for dinner. Dishes $4-$16.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

It comes, as these things do, on the heels of bankers—Bankers of America, in this case, whose new skyscraper on Forty-second Street houses the restaurant, which, for twenty years, inhabited a brownstone on Sixty-first Street. At quitting time, the suits swarm the bar, palming Heinekens and Pinots, popping pork-belly sliders like pieces of popcorn, clogging up the footways with their laptop cases. It’s all very corporate, in the best sense—smooth, genial, humming. This is T.G.I. Friday’s, the midtown way. The fig-thyme Martini, delicious and embarrassing, is our Mudslide.</p><p data-wc="184" word_count="184">The bar is the place to hang out at Aureole, but there is also a barroom—which is basically the bar, with tables, chairs, and less terrific service—and, toward the back, a proper dining room. Lunch and dinner there are two very different experiences. In the afternoon, when the alternative is doing spreadsheets, a meal with a colleague feels decadent and lucky (five kinds of rolls!). Later, when the alternative is doing whatever you want with whomever you want to do it with, the room feels less like a hideaway and—with its copper-colored vases and sprays of tiger lilies—more like an autumnally inflected isolation chamber. Charlie Palmer, by now, is more C.E.O. than chef, and his food has a sugared, edgeless aspect that is maybe a little too lulling. The risotto, a bright-yellow mush of pumpkin, cranberries, walnuts, and prosciutto—it brings to mind creamed corn—has a Gerberesque quality. The shiitake-mushroom soup, poured over pork-and-shrimp dumplings, is pleasingly smooth, but it needs a jolt to transcend canned-goods territory. The “citrus juices” the menu promised would have done wonderfully.</p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">Besides being sweet, the dishes can be awfully busy. The skate comes out with an absolutely perfect sear, but who notices when you’ve got red grapes and green olives on the same plate? (There’s also broccoli rabe, pine nuts, and fregola pasta.) You wish that Palmer’s food, before it went out at night, would take off one piece of jewelry. The daubs of quince, Mission figs (which were good poached in port but would have been so much better plain), and walnut-leaf curlicues—oh, yeah, and the piece of blue-cheese cheesecake they accompany—are almost more work than they’re worth. Thank God it will eventually be Saturday. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner and Sundays for dinner. Entrées $19-$40; dining room prix fixe $84.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

There are tables full of Italian speakers; the manager sends off regular customers with a kiss on the cheek and “Buona sera!” If the lone woman in a party picks the table’s bottle of wine, the waiter might remark, “It’s just like in Sicily, the matriarch of the family chooses.” The restaurant offers Roman cuisine, the philosophy of which it lays out on its Web site, somewhat enigmatically: “Even nowadays that Rome is a big city, and that we lost the view of fields and pastures, the Roman cuisine is keeping the simplicity in preparation and the very high quality of its products . . . From dish to dish, from exquisiteness to exquisiteness the Roman cuisine is a healthy cuisine, tasty, rich of creativity that escapes useless artifices.” </p><p data-wc="244" word_count="244">Yet if appearances point mostly to excellence—particularly the atmospheric space, previously occupied by AOC Bedford, with its cozy brick and old-Italia artifacts—there are occasional unsettling portents. The waiter who disappears halfway through service. Dishes that suddenly become unavailable. The pizza-delivery guy who shows up with two large pepperoni pies for the staff. Perhaps it was fatigue—Friday night, nearly closing time—but the food appeared alarmingly slapdash. Salads, one of oranges and fennel, another of artichokes and rocket, were haphazardly dressed and insipid. (“They have to get some credit for being exactly as advertised,” one diner remarked.) Pastas had a glimmer of promise, with rich flavors but uneven textures—the <em>bucatini all’amatriciana</em> was infused with pork flavor, from tough, chewy little pieces of meat. Hope grew with the entrées: a flavorful oven-baked chicken, with crispy potatoes; tender rabbit tinged with sage. The wine was delicious, the prices very reasonable, the dessert disappointing (a wan chocolate cake, an order of ricotta cheesecake M.I.A.). Back to the statement of purpose: “The ‘Roman DOC’ is as a joker in the everyday life as he is demanding and gourmet once he sits at the table: he wants to eat well and drink better and this attitude comes from the state of things. In fact his land offers more than anyone can desires in food.” It’s a puzzler. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/16/prime-meats	Prime Meats	465 Court St. 	29.7698764	-95.3922699	718-254-0327	2009/11/16	<p class="noindent" data-wc="106" word_count="106">A few months back, an earnest young man in Brooklyn explained how to eat a sausage. Bavarians, apparently, are brought their <em>Weisswurst</em> in a bowl of its cooking water; they cut it longitudinally, remove the meat, and discard the casing. Why not just cut the thing latitudinally and eat it the regular way? Well, because this is the new venture from Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, whose Frankies Spuntino, with its panini and other light Italian dishes, gave rise to a mini-empire that has established itself as the apogee of a certain kind of laid-back but fastidious hipsterism, a zone where heirloom tomato meets vintage T-shirt.</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">When the premises a few doors down from the Spuntino became available, the two Franks realized that the huge kitchen would enable them to prepare all their meats from scratch. The new restaurant is a sort of homage to late-Victorian German-American restaurants, and the Franks take obvious delight in curating every element of it. The wood panelling and large antique bar are beautifully finished, there are gas lamps, and behind the bar is a nest of antique punch bowls (the punch changes daily). Waiters look as if they’d auditioned for “Deadwood”; their uniform includes braces and waistcoats, and facial hair seems to be compulsory. And cocktails abound with recherché ingredients like homemade Buddha’s-hand bitters; they are a standout, even in the context of the current cocktail renaissance.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">The restaurant is bound to delight the Franks’ fans, but, if there’s a weak link, it’s the food. The menu is on the small side, and the Franks seem so absorbed in the voguish quest for unusual or local ingredients that they’ve overlooked the transformative potential of actually cooking things. A dish of meats and sauerkraut was rather waterlogged, and a sea-bass special, in a buttery sauce with white cranberry beans, verged on overcooked. But there are successes, too: trout arrives in splendidly crispy fillets, topped with finely grated horseradish, and the lambs’ ribs with <em>shisito</em> pepper—cured overnight in cumin, then smoked over apple chips and hickory—augurs well for the in-house butchering. Prime Meats is clearly a work in progress; a second dining room seems constantly about to open, and employees speak excitedly about plans for a speakeasy upstairs and a retail butcher shop around the corner. For now, it’s probably best to stand at the bar, watch the focus brought to creating cocktails, and wonder if similar care could usefully be applied to the cooking. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Main courses $13-$20.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/09/saraghina	Saraghina	435 Halsey St., Brooklyn 	40.68332735	-73.9354158	718-574-0010	2009/11/09	<p class="noindent" data-wc="159" word_count="159">In Fellini’s “8½,” Saraghina is the wild-eyed, frizzy-haired whore who dances a grotesque rumba for a gaggle of schoolboys. This restaurant, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, is considerably more seductive. (It was designed by the wife of one of the owners; the family lives down the block.) Dozens of candles illuminate whitewashed walls and an array of eclectic objets—dusty bowling pins and apothecary bottles, water-stained mid-century cooking guides, road signs that point toward vanished summer resorts. A pile of firewood teeters near the front door, en route to the blazing pizza oven. A tearaway calendar, courtesy of Smedley Bros. Lumber-Millwork, is stuck four days after Christmas, 1961. If you ignore the view out the windows—a fertility clinic, a bodega, and a fluorescent-lit Chinese takeaway spot with the hopeful name Fun Chow—you might imagine that you’re spending an autumn evening at an invitingly decrepit lake house, full of the accumulated ephemera of a family to which you wish you belonged.</p><p data-wc="272" word_count="272">Saraghina has been justly lauded for its Neapolitan-style pies, but it would be a mistake to lump it with the city’s new crop of hoity-toity pizzerias. Indeed, Saraghina is that rarest of species, a serious restaurant that doesn’t take itself too seriously. In addition to the pizzas—the best is the capocollo, laden with fiery neck-meat ham—there are a dozen or so nightly specials, each typically excellent and suitable for sharing. With a crowd of one’s intimates, it’s prudent to order one of everything and several carafes of the house red. (The prices encourage indulgence.) Fish is prepared with particular expertise; grilled octopus, served in a piquant tomato-and-celery salad, was pleasantly unrubbery, mussels tasted so fresh and simple that they might have been steamed in seawater, and a surprisingly flaky swordfish made an ideal foil for the crisp green beans on the side. Another highlight was the dish of burrata cheese, which (locavores be warned) arrives weekly by plane from Puglia. To get the freshest serving, plan a late-week supper. This helpful tip comes by way of the chef and co-owner, Edoardo Mantelli, who daylights as a partner at the posh clothing label Tocca. At Saraghina, Mantelli often saunters out of the kitchen to greet his guests, and, in the event that any pizza has been neglected on your table, he may offer advice on freezing and reheating the leftovers. Of course, he said recently, shrugging and smiling, you could always just eat it cold from the fridge. “That’s what I do at home.” (Open daily for dinner and weekends for brunch. Pizzas $10-$18; dishes $8-$15.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

This converted warehouse at the northern edge of Williamsburg does triple duty as a bowling alley, a music hall, and a grub house. Its kingpin, Peter Shapiro, the former owner of the bygone jam-bandy club Wetlands, has dreamed up an emporium that combines hedonistic excess (deep-end leather couches, spiked milkshakes, brisket, live music) with eco-consciousness (reclaimed-cork floors, no bottled beer, live music). For the eats, he brought in the Bromberg brothers, the creators of Blue Ribbon, to draw up a rebuke to every limpid water dog and fossilized onion ring you’ve ever downed, then regretted, at Wherever Lanes. They tinkered with comfort-food classics, secure in the knowledge that no bowler will ever crave endive. It’s a menu that begs over-ordering, as well as this remark from your waiter, regarding the procedure for delivering the food: “You guys want it as it fits?” “Fits where?” is one reply; the table is bigger than the stomach.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">Still, all you have to do, while stuffed, is take a few steps forward and drop a twelve-pound ball on the floor, so there’s no sin in downing the carefully considered greaseballs the Blue Ribbon boys sling your way. Their fried chicken, dipped in matzoh batter, seasoned with Cajun spices, and accompanied by white bread and honey, has Earl Anthony game. The calamari, commingled with fried jalapeño, is the Dick Weber of fried squid. The San Gennaro, loaded with finely ground Italian sausage, is the Johnny Petraglia of French-bread pizzas: crisp outside, fluffy inside, it has all of the virtue, and none of the vice, of Stouffer’s. There are a few gutter balls; some might find the mac and cheese too creamy and the “Really” Sloppy Joe really actually too sweet. But the score sheet shows more X’s than —’s.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">On a recent evening, the lanes were busy but not loud; the pins hang on strings, which helps muffle the din. Giant video screens showed montages from raunchy old B-movies like “The Student Nurses” and “Caged Heat.” Around eleven, the Roots took the stage, the dance floor filled up, and a waiter came by with Nutella-bourbon shakes, a convergence that felt like nailing a spare on a four-ten split.

The banh mi—a baguette (“banh mi” translates to, basically, “bread”) often filled with various pork products, pickled vegetables, fresh cilantro, and <em>sriracha</em>—has long been peddled in unassuming storefronts in the far reaches of Chinatown and Sunset Park. Some, in fact, seem to be clandestine sidelines for other businesses, like the kitchenette stashed at the end of a jewelry store hawking faux-jade Buddha pendants (the legendary Banh Mi Saigon Bakery, on Mott St.), or, in the case of the twenty-year-old Sau Voi Corp., a glass counter tucked inside a tiny battle-worn Asian-CD shop that also happens to sell bras, eye shadow, cigarettes, porn, and lotto tickets. If you find yourself on jury duty at lunch hour, you could do much worse than Sau Voi Corp.’s exemplary <em>bánh mì dac biet</em> (the requisite No. 1), stuffed by amiable counter ladies with pâté, pork roll (ingredients can include pork, cornstarch, fish sauce, MSG, salt, garlic, and baking powder), and Vietnamese ham (which often contains pig ear, for crunch), garnished with pickled carrots, daikon, cucumber, spicy garlic sauce, and foot-long sprigs of cilantro. The bread, crispy on the outside and soft inside, and the sweet-and-sour veggies are what make it; the mystery meats—the mark of a truly authentic banh mi—could startle the faint of heart into long-term vegetarianism. </p><p data-wc="188" word_count="188">    The sandwich might have remained a cultish underdog if not for the recession-friendly ambition of Michael (Bao) Huynh, who has recently expanded his Vietnamese restaurant empire to include Baoguette, a chainlet of slick banh-mi joints, with branches in Murray Hill, the East Village, the West Village, and, soon, Wall Street, midtown, and the Lower East Side. The namesake sandwich, billed as a classic banh mi, contains, appropriately, myriad pork varieties (a smear of pâté, crimson barbecued pork, a slice of headcheese, and a generous helping of pork roll), but the bread, though tasty, is too copious, and the garlicky pickling juices and fish sauce lend a bright sort of funkiness; ultimately, it verges on garish. On the other hand, there’s irresistible pan-fried rice cake—tiny duck egg atop spongy rice-noodle-like cubes, flavorful sausage, and green papaya; the spicy, addictive Sloppy Bao sandwich (think Sloppy Joe but fantastic, with jalapeños and cilantro); and deeply nuanced <em>pho</em> (a comforting twenty-spice, marrow-shin-brisket broth rich with noodles and thin slabs of beef). Next stop: Atlantic City. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Sau Voi sandwiches $4-$4.20; Baoguette sandwiches $5-$8.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

There are some hints of the neighborhood: the rumble of the subway, the chandeliers that look like cages. But the service is sincere, even earnest (no indifference or insouciance here), and the older, well-heeled crowd doesn’t flinch at a thirty-dollar entrée. Even so, the locals aren’t shunning the place. One recent evening, after a longtime area resident ran into a group of old acquaintances, the waitress remarked, “This is the place for chance encounters. The other night I had three old friends I hadn’t seen in years walk through the door—and they weren’t even together.”</p><p data-wc="195" word_count="195">    Civetta has had something of a rough start, and the uneven food caused some speculation that Suhanosky wasn’t spending enough time in the new kitchen. But not long ago, with a fresh menu, it was hard to find a disappointing dish. Little meatballs of lamb and goat cheese were succulent, though the cheese manifested itself mostly through a faint gaminess. Monkfish <em>polpette</em>, the size of golf balls, sat in a rich tomato sauce atop richer polenta. “You could serve that to people and they wouldn’t even know it was fish,” remarked one diner, by way of a compliment. The <em>filetto di manzo</em> came with a crunchy artichoke salad that added a welcome astringency to the beef. Any lingering fear of ordinariness was banished by the gnocchi, perfect light buttons of potato, laced with mushrooms and polished with a delicious<em> fonduta</em>. Dessert seemed almost anticlimactic, and aspersions were cast, in particular against the cannoli. “Those are never any good,” a dissenter claimed. The cannoli arrived: crisp cylinders, stuffed with chocolate and vanilla creams. One bite: “I take it all back.” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner; weekends for brunch and dinner.

It’s not that the food is so bad (in fact, it’s very, very good), or that it’s extraordinarily expensive (three courses for sixty-nine dollars), but, rather, that every other aspect of the undertaking is fraught with awkwardness. First, there’s the name—better to pick another place than to have to mutter those clunky syllables on the phone to a date. Entering the restaurant, or trying to, is another exercise in embarrassment. A doorman at the Setai condominium points to an elevator. You get in, punch the button, nothing happens. Eventually, you may find yourself wandering the dark halls of the hotel, looking for another way up. At the restaurant’s reception, the unease persists. Why is the place both so vast and so empty? Why, to get to the dining room, must one walk a gantlet of giant oil lamps, as if a Rose Ceremony is about to begin? There are gongs, samurai swords, bottles of wine lining more empty maze-like corridors. The effect is bad-dreamy: you’re Fortunato, late for a meeting with the heads of the yakuza, one of whom is your friend’s dad who just moved in with his yoga-teacher girlfriend. In any case, the discrepancy between what SHO Shaun Hergatt aspires to be—a first-rate fine-dining establishment—and what it is, a Silk Road sepulchre, just makes you sad.</p><p data-wc="218" word_count="218">    The good news: while you’re wallowing in transitive anxiety, you can eat exceptionally well. Shaun Hergatt, who is Australian and used to work at the Ritz, may be the Barry Sanders of restaurants—an extremely talented guy who, even on a lousy team, manages some impressive plays. For one thing, he has a way with seafood: delicate scallop carpaccio and salt-pressed Tasmanian ocean trout, halibut as smooth as snow, zucchini blossoms stuffed to bursting with blue prawns. The amuses-bouches—lobster in a shot glass, a tomato-and-fennel soup—are painstaking and beaucoup. A double duck consommé brings to mind the old clowns-in-a-Volkswagen conundrum: how many <em>canards</em> can one fit in a porcelain bowl? The rabbit loins, too, are deliciously concentrated; even a yogurt-marinated <em>poussin</em>, the politest-sounding of dishes, has a surprising intensity. A dessert called Chocolate and Jasmine Inspiration is inspiring enough—crunchy, creamy, chocolatey, and citrusy all at once—to live down its name. If Hergatt’s cooking can occasionally seem fussy—the menu references kinome, nashi pear, banyuls reduction, tatsoi, urfa spice, and wilted tetragonia, which turns out to be a sort of imported spinach—it’s an understandable act of compensation. You have to let your light shine twice as brightly under a shroud. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Two-course dinner $57; three-course dinner $69.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/10/05/the-brooklyn-star	The Brooklyn Star	33 Havemeyer St. 	40.71557665	-73.9534279201775	718-599-9899	2009/10/05	<p class="noindent" data-wc="181" word_count="181">In 2004, an out-of-work cook from Santa Fe named Joaquin Baca, tired of sleeping on his sister’s couch in the West Village, applied, through Monster.com, to be the deputy to a nobody chef—the No. 2 in a two-man operation. Thus began the rise of the Momofuku Dynasty, with Baca and the much-extolled David Chang sweating it out in their six-hundred-square-foot noodle bar. Last spring, Baca gambled again: his first solo endeavor. Not surprisingly, the result, the Brooklyn Star, is bathed in a thick we’ll-remember-this-when vibe. The space sits in the middle of a ghostly Williamsburg strip, without a competing commercial enterprise in eyeshot; a street sign out front dangles upside down from its pole. The difference, of course, is that Baca is now a name, and, on a certain level, he’s showing off: I will cook in the boonies, and you will come and eat. Indeed, a decent crowd, if not the hordes foodies predicted, settles into the built-in booths each night, hungry for Baca’s nouveau Southern comfort food—that is, square meals for the hipster set.</p><p data-wc="242" word_count="242">     One might question the bacon lobby’s influence on Baca. A waiter, dressed in a plaid shirt and bolo tie, advocates that you add bacon to an otherwise perfect skillet of corn bread. A wedge of iceberg lettuce is drizzled with bacon-buttermilk dressing. The topnotch half chicken is served with peaches, pea shoots, and bacon. The mac and cheese is bacon-flecked (a pleasant dash of salt and smoke amid all that goo). Even the meat in the hot meatloaf sandwich comes wrapped in, yes, bacon. (There are impending plans to serve brunch, and one can only imagine the monumental role bacon will play there.) But do not fear: many avenues exist to fulfill your other-white-meat quota. Baca fries pig tails, and adds braised pig leg to his collard greens. He marinates fun-size ribs in Dr. Pepper before slathering them with his own barbecue vinaigrette—a similar sauce is found, misguidedly, atop the oysters. If you are a vegetarian, the Brooklyn Star offers only side dishes, like okra, creamed corn, and mashed potatoes. (If you’re a flamboyant carnivore, there’s a twenty-eight-ounce T-bone.) A liquor license has yet to be secured, but occasionally there are fruity concoctions such as watermelon juice infused with blackberries. As with a quality milkshake, chunks of it get stuck in your straw. The drink is enviously creative and over-the-top delicious—alone, enough to keep Baca off his sister’s sofa. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $14-$21.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

The TVs at Warren 77 aren’t as easy to see—they’re set high, at neckcraning angles—and a full third of the space has no screens at all. The best vantage point, a middle section of comfy leather booths, carries a hefty five-hundred-dollar minimum to watch an entire sporting event. Even the décor—vintage klieg lights, white roses in vases along the wall, glossy color photographs of John McEnroe and Hulk Hogan, among others—seems to signify that the owners were more interested in style than sweat.</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">Perhaps that’s not surprising, considering that Sean Avery—of the New York Rangers and, one off-season, <em>Vogue</em>—is a co-owner. “For me, to go to a bar to watch sports is really tough—sports bars in America can be kind of horrifying,” he noted to style.com in June, shortly after Warren 77 opened, adding that the walls were also hung with Warhol and Arbus. But there is a sense that at least some of the clientele are there less for the fine art than for a glimpse of the man himself. “Your favorite hockey player is here!” hissed a man to his date one evening, as Avery entered, wearing a thin white T-shirt and a black satin jacket. “Oh my God, where?” she squealed.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">With stadiums setting a new standard of what constitutes game fare, the sports bar can no longer slop out any old food. Here, the steak sandwich, swathed in mozzarella and served with a rich au jus, pairs tender meat with a soft ciabatta; the mac and cheese is buttery, with a crunchy layer of bread crumbs on top. The chopped salad, a bountiful mix of asparagus, avocado, egg, blue cheese, olives, and more, makes for a moment of incredulity—who gets to eat a satisfying salad while watching Federer get beat by Del Potro? On the other hand, the wings—a staple of the beer-and-football crowd—are a disappointment, gristly and far too spicy, even in the mild version. At least the burger gives the place some grease cred; there’s a nice balance between the bun and the patty, with juicy meat and crisp toppings. It’s almost enough to make you forget why you came here in the first place. “This is a bad sports bar,” one visitor remarked recently. “Nobody is actually into the game.” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for brunch and dinner.

Originating in England, the gastropub heralded the arrival of edible, even sophisticated cuisine in drinking establishments whose culinary aspirations had previously risen no higher than the potato chip. Transplanted to New York, the genre now signals a lessening of ambition. Chefs who a decade ago would have been striving to come up with some pretentious new fusion of styles or ingredients now indulge in the more insidious pretension of being down to earth—serving up calorific comfort food like meat loaf or mac and cheese, perhaps with some attention-grabbing twist. Foodies shrug and mutter that hard times necessitate simpler fare, but the vogue preceded the downturn and—like the overpriced designer T-shirt—may represent a flight not from expense but from taste. As a term, “gastropub” is in danger of coming to mean “food for reasonably affluent young people who don’t really care about food (or their waistline).”</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">That said, Michael Psilakis’s new gastropub, tucked into a tricky space just off Broadway, is far better than many. Psilakis, who in the same venue first opened Onera, then Kefi, both ambitious, Greek-inspired restaurants, has definite talent. Sweetbreads, lightly breaded and cooked not a second too long, have a buoyant feel and an almost floral taste. “Salsa verde” gazpacho, made with cucumber, tomatillo, and jalapeño, has a richness that comes not from slathering on lipids but from pure flavor. Too often, though, the gastropub ethos prevails, and dishes absorb more grease than they can bear. A mountainous meat loaf is both covered in cheese and permeated with it. Bone marrow is submerged in garlic butter, escargot-style; the bones, sliced lengthways, arrive like two waterlogged canoes. </p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">The room, small and far from quiet, is cheekily decorated—a suit of armor confronts you on arrival—and, this being a gastropub, cute gimmicks abound. The drinks list features mega-pours of whiskey served in hip flasks and malt liquor served in brown paper bags. There are extravagant milkshakes and sundaes, and sloganed T-shirts worn by the (uniformly upbeat and helpful) staff reinforce the message that it’s O.K. to regress: “Live young. Embrace your inner child. Nourish the id.” Perhaps the new gastropubs really are nourishing the id, and satisfying a craving.

So it’s appropriate that Robert De Niro’s Locanda Verde, which replaced the critic-trampled, short-lived Ago, in the Greenwich Hotel, seems at first glance rather high-end faux, or, as one diner put it, “like a restaurant in Denver called Tribeca.” Everything feels new—the backlit mirrored shelves, the giant-hooded stainless-steel pendant lights, even the bricks—but the chef Andrew Carmellini’s blissfully homey Italian food serves as a reminder that cooking what you grow is a very old, and very good, idea. </p><p data-wc="188" word_count="188">The restaurant’s name, which means “green inn,” indicates a market-inspired philosophy, reflected in the seasonally changing menu, which is, at its best—with dishes like beef-pork-and-veal-stuffed Grandma’s Ravioli and ultra-rustic Gabagoul &amp; Grana—even more comforting than it sounds. To start, there are cicchetti (“little snacks”), which include a heap of homemade sheep’s-milk ricotta, sprinkled with sea salt and oregano and served with grilled country bread, and smooth chicken-liver spread on thin crostini, topped with golden sultanas. A salad of sweet local cherry tomatoes and watermelon, served with smoked ricotta from Abruzzi (it tastes like feta), channels Strega Nona; a lightly fried artichoke appetizer, with yogurt and specks of mint, complements a gorgeous thick-cut Colorado lamb chop, grilled, with a vincotto glaze, atop faro and chard. The porchetta sandwich, with pale shaved pork and melted provolone, is an aberrant downscale inclusion that should be saved for the street-cart expansion. But the pastas showcase Carmellini’s spirit and skill—ethereal robiola-cheese ravioli, with tomatoes; maltagliati, randomly torn sheets of perfectly done pasta, tossed with pesto; creamy lemon risotto, rescued from monotony by vibrant chili oil and chives.</p><p data-wc="69" word_count="69">On a summer evening, the windows open to the breeze, a gaze at the sunset across the Hudson River affords a view of the gleaming silver Jersey City skyline.

Having already appropriated northern Italy (via Alto) and southern Italy (via Convivio), White decided this year to focus not only on the seam of the boot, the country’s forty-five hundred miles of coastline, but also to transcend the boundaries of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. His colossal menu presents, with help from the guys at FedEx, freshly caught pagello and branzino from Italy, as well as lobster from Nova Scotia and sea scallops from Rhode Island. Recently, a server hawked the day’s catch by rolling a large fish cart between tables—suddenly, the raw creatures were staring at you beseechingly from their bed of ice. Later, a twirl of the fork in a langoustine-studded <em>spinosini</em> resulted in a surprise impalement of one of the crustacean’s eyeballs. You may feel as though you have returned to biology class.</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">White and his business partner, Chris Cannon, spent more than $4.5 million on Marea. They flew in Bolognese artisans to construct the walls in the extensive bar area from a giant slab of flaxen Egyptian onyx and those in the dining room from Indonesian rosewood. All around sit the gilded shells of nautiluses and conches, something like Sylvia Earle’s trophy case. One flight down, there’s a chef’s dining room with galley kitchen, and, beyond the bar, a crudo area reserved for walk-ins. Diners might spot White, a debonair and orotund man who grew up in Wisconsin, dining there with his wife and daughter.</p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">On a Saturday evening not long ago, after a woman at a nearby table admitted that if not for the omega-3s she wouldn’t be a fish eater, it was decided that the meal should be treated as an equation of net health gains: fish oil versus methylmercury, unsaturated fatty acids versus butter and lard. An amuse-bouche of liquefied honeydew topped with crispy prosciutto and a starter crostini of sea urchin covered in <em>lardo</em> seemed to keep the calculation at zero. But a springy lobster salad, with <em>burrata</em> cheese and eggplant, was judged both excellent and relatively healthful. Then, after dishes of creamy gnochetti with shrimp, swordfish atop an onion purée, and seafood soup—mussels, oysters, clams, scallops, langoustines, and potatoes in a weak tomato sauce—well, who, without a graphing calculator, could do the math? Besides, there was an emptied bottle of Muscadet to factor in, and nobody had yet had their vegetables. On cue, the waiter delivered a splendid zucchini cake.

Surrounded by girls.” Her dinner companion found her at the bar, amid several teeming parties of young women, their hair brushing her bare shoulders as they leaned in to order drinks. One’s first inclination was to credit the gimmicky cocktail menu, but a few rounds proved that these drinks were not girly; even the sweet-sounding ones were, in deference to an alleged old-timey disdain for sugar, very dry. The bartender, in a kind of lacy Rosa’s Cantina dress, explained that during Prohibition there wasn’t any mulled fruit. There was gin, however, and it went well with cava and a dash of lemon juice.</p><p data-wc="282" word_count="282">    Hotel Griffou appeared to be in the Daily Candy stage of early renown, a destination for new-restaurant scalp-collectors and spotters of personages whose names in print may tip between Roman and bold. Among the owners are guys who have opened other speakeasy-ish joints (such as Freemans and La Esquina) that have managed to feed people well while maintaining some cool. This restaurant, unmarked outside, occupies the garden level of an old Village town house that was once a nineteenth-century boardinghouse frequented by Mark Twain. More recently, the space belonged to Marylou’s, a neighborhood mainstay. Past the bar is a warren of dining rooms (the Library, the Studio, the Palm Terrace, and so on), each with its own category of bric-a-brac and contrived kitsch. In the Salon, a giant, droll color photograph of an older woman in a trenchcoat, shooting flames from her wrists, seemed to epitomize the place. The food at a restaurant like this must be good enough merely to stave off the fear that you may be the mark in a scam. As it stands, you wonder. The menu is heavy on French-infused comfort food, some of which, like the gloppy lobster-thermidor fondue or the plate of fried sweetbreads in a white onion sauce (reminiscent of a Philly cheesesteak, which just seemed wrong), could benefit from the restraint evident in the cocktails. Still, Hotel Griffou has been open just two months, so it deserves some slack. Simpler stuff—such as the bacon-Gruyère burger—bears up better. The pork paillard, pounded thin and seasoned with chives, shallots, and veal jus, comes from a recipe set down by Madame Marie Griffou in 1892. Allegedly. (Open daily for dinner.

It’s finding the middle ground—the place with good food, fair prices, and nice waiters where you and your best friend can have a Martini and a hanger steak on a Friday night, or a Bloody Mary and a croque-madame on a Sunday morning, without having made a reservation a week in advance—that can be a drag. That’s why Belcourt, a Parisian-inflected café and restaurant, inspires such appreciation amongst its regulars, a vaguely literary crowd that, on a recent night, included a <em>Times</em> book reviewer and, nearby, two famous novelists sharing a charcuterie plate and passing paperbacks across a watermarked wooden table. </p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">Belcourt’s menu is more ambitious than it has to be: given the room’s pleasing ambience (walls of huge windows, mint-green woodwork, smoky mirrors, a few modern vases here and there, so that it doesn’t all seem too derivative), the usual array of bistro favorites would have done. But, in addition to a beef burger, the chef, Matt Hamilton, offers a pink, peppery lamb burger and dresses both with spicy ketchup and zucchini pickles. For sides, there are fingerling potatoes, with olive oil and sea salt, and delicious fried scallions—like onion rings trapped in the body of fries (which are also available). Hamilton’s influences range from Persia (chicken roasted with rose petals and cardamom) to the Mediterranean (sweetbreads marinated in lemon, instead of the usual heavy preparations) to, presumably, the Southern U.S. (warm buttermilk biscuits). Some dishes can seem incoherent, such as an appetizer of grilled Spanish octopus garnished with fluorescent cardamom-pickled carrots and a heavy-handed sauce of mint and jalapeño. (It looked worse than it tasted.) Mostly, though, the jalapeños and the harissas and the <em>labnehs</em> and the lasagnas get along fine. Like Belcourt, they’re the perfect compromise.

The name, for starters, offers a clumsy tip of the hat to CBGB, the legendary punk club, which used to be nearby. Inside, the décor strives to evoke the street’s ubiquitous restaurant-supply stores. As for the cuisine, it’s self-consciously down-market, and in place of an extensive wine list there’s lots and lots of beer. But Boulud is the uptown chef who introduced New York to the twenty-seven-dollar hamburger, and he doesn’t let anyone forget it. Beers have “notes of dandelion” or taste like “sea breeze and coriander.” Mirrored walls are scrawled with pithy quotes by the likes of Shakespeare and Virginia Woolf. The open shelves around the dining room, stacked with surplus tableware, suggest Williams-Sonoma, and the clientele is more trading pit than mosh pit. “Daniel, he likes the rock ’n’ roll,” Boulud’s music programmer insisted to the <em>Times</em>. Nevertheless, dining at DBGB can feel a bit like seeing your dad don a motorcycle jacket.</p><p data-wc="212" word_count="212">Boulud might think that he needs the thematic gimmickry to justify the restaurant’s relative affordability, but, in this day and age, affordability justifies itself. Happily, the best dishes on the eclectic menu tend to be the cheapest. Among the impressive variety of sausages, the <em>espagnole</em> is a standout—sweet peppers balance the chorizo kick—as is the <em>boudin basque</em>, a pleasantly creamy twist on the conventional style. The Yankee burger, on the other hand, with its shredded iceberg lettuce and sesame-seed bun, is a reminder that sometimes conventional is best. Matzo-ball soup, a surprising inclusion, is made with a “double stock”—ultra-concentrated chicken broth—and it’s good enough to put Katz’s Deli, just down Houston, on notice. The desserts, though, are mostly juvenile concoctions, served with a drizzle of irony. An “omelette Norvegienne” (a.k.a. Baked Alaska) could be mistaken for a slice of Carvel ice-cream cake, were it not for the halo of flames. After dinner one recent evening, a well-heeled patron emerged onto the sidewalk with a golf club propped jauntily on his shoulder, while a chauffeur-driven S.U.V. idled at the curb. If you scrub the grit from the Bowery, after all, it’s just the East Side. (Open daily for dinner. Entrees $14-$26.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Seasonal, a tiny wedge of a restaurant, certainly offers a less outré aspect of the nation. Translucently white walls, a tasteful painting or two above the dark padded booths—you almost forget what the place looks like as soon as you walk in the door. Between the aggressive blandness and the menu, which on a hot summer’s evening reads like all the foods you don’t want to eat (spätzle, veal, pork belly, accompanied by things like creamed spinach and potato pancakes), it’s surprising to see the room fill up. </p><p data-wc="190" word_count="190">Yet there is a charmingly detached, Old World air to the staff, including a waiter who seems slightly annoyed by the English language. (“The special ravioli are goat cheese, with . . . hmm, creamed corn?” he offered the other evening, with a quizzical look.) There’s a certain comedy, too, in trying to parse out one’s order: <em>Frühlingssalat</em> (an arugula salad), <em>Jakobsmuscheln</em> (sea scallops), <em>Zwiebelroastbraten</em> (strip loin). And, it turns out, there’s nothing dour about the food. The ravioli (with its confounding creamed corn) was oddly ethereal. A poached quail egg sat astride a pretty plate of halibut and salmon carpaccio; pea soup balanced its natural sweetness with smoky bacon and sour pickled onions. An exceptionally tender lamb dish was clearly the best thing on the menu, but the other meats—Wiener schnitzel, the cutlet tucked inside a pillow of light, fried breading, or the <em>Tafelspitz</em>, a poached steak in a rich oxtail consommé—made a fine showing as well. The sides were a different story: the latter wasn’t done justice by greasy potato pancakes and eerily smooth creamed spinach (“It’s like eating paint,” one diner complained). </p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">Throughout, there was a lightness to the meal; at one point, even the waiter succumbed to levity, humming along to the Euro-pop soundtrack while pouring out a glass of wine. Then came the <em>Erdbeerknödel</em>. The crash of consonants heralded two golf-ball-size dumplings, rolled in sweet crumbs and filled with strawberries, with a slightly soupy accompaniment of rhubarb compote and pumpkin-seed ice cream. Stupor set in, and it seemed as though one could linger there all evening. Finally, a diner asked, “May we get the check?” The waiter furrowed his brow, shrugged, and said, “If you want it.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

The walls are hung with nautical charts, pictures of boats, and samples of sailor’s knots (should a diner suddenly need to tie, say, a sheepshank or a lighterman’s hitch), and a huge glass sculpture of vaguely aquatic pods and fronds depends from the ceiling, looking like a collaboration between Dale Chihuly and David Attenborough. But the lavish décor is also a shrewd way of disguising what is really an awkward L-shaped space stuck in an unpromising location, where the vortex of the Holland Tunnel drains all life from the streets. </p><p data-wc="155" word_count="155">There’s a similar mix of extravagance and canniness in the menu, which is studded with ingredients like <em>shisito</em>, yellow curry, <em>sudachi</em>, and <em>lop chum</em>, signalling a brave adherence to fusion cuisine. But eclecticism needn’t mean chaos. Besides, can it be helped if fish goes well with coconut milk and lemongrass? Clam chowder was successfully reconfigured as a kind of Thai curry, but its thick texture and floating potatoes insured that the New England version wasn’t entirely forgotten. Lobster with green garlic, crispy peas, and baby carrots came in a buttery curry-and-smoked-paprika emulsion, along with a single large maitake mushroom whose flavor permeated the rest of the dish. Some juxtapositions don’t work, and occasionally you find yourself admiring virtuosity while feeling that a simpler approach might actually have produced something better. Crispy branzino arrived in a flour-crust exoskeleton whose even stiffness must be hard to achieve but which left the fish dry.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">Near the restaurant, several swank condo and hotel developments, including the gargantuan Trump SoHo, are nearing completion, and you get the sense that if these buildings are ever filled Harbour’s future will be secure. For now, a lively youngish crowd seems to be drawn by the reasonable prices. A sprinkling of older folk, some heavily tanned, seemed harder to place. Perhaps, relying on the restaurant’s appearance, they were tricked into thinking it really was a cruise. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

Hearst and her best friend (and general manager), Sarah Krathen, conceived of Sorella, Italian for “sister,” during a journey through Piedmont, Italy’s legendary northern wine region. In homage to these geographic origins, Krathen has curated a hundred-and-fifty-bottle list biased toward Piedmontese varietals. (There’s also fantastic Gabry sparkling rosé, from the nearby Treviso province.) Befitting the venue’s wine-soaked sensibility (one wall was literally painted with it), and the youth of the proprietors (both women are under twenty-five), the service is relaxed. Sometimes too relaxed: a slouching, mumbling bartender undermines the ambience of his domain. You’re better off in the dining room, where a friendly hostess doesn’t flinch at seating an incomplete party. Hydrangeas, herbs, and citrus flourish under a solarium roof. There is an aura of healthfulness, as at a California spa.</p><p data-wc="294" word_count="294">This illusion is broken with the first crunch of gratis <em>grissini</em>—the salty, twiglike bread sticks, served in a paper cone, are as abundant as they are addictive. Crispy fried Brussels sprouts, tossed with bits of bacon and apple, are equally habit-forming. To start the meal, diners are encouraged to select a variety of shareable <em>qualcosinas</em> (“little somethings”), any one of which might give your cardiologist a heart attack based on description alone. Hearst employs bacon liberally, as though it were merely a seasoning. In addition to the Brussels sprouts, it comes on quail, with sweetbreads, and, sugar-cured, sprinkled over fluffy French toast. Bacon also stars in the <em>pâté de fegato</em>, which has quickly become Hearst’s signature dish: a spongy square of duck-fat bread, topped with chicken-liver mousse, topped with bacon, topped with a fried egg. Sweet and musky and extraordinarily decadent, it’s like something Willy Wonka might have dreamt up if he’d dabbled in small plates. A bite or two is plenty—there’s still an entrée to contend with. On a recent evening, the main courses comprised halibut with puréed potatoes (rich), a schnitzel-fried pork chop (richer), and goat-cheese risotto (richest). Well-prepared though they were, it was hard to muster much enthusiasm after the preceding symphony of triglycerides. Fresh vegetables would have offered a welcome contrast, but even the escarole salad was dressed in brown butter. Skip dessert—you won’t want it—and finish with a homemade basil soda instead. For a moment, the tingly herbal elixir might convince you that you’re just relaxing between beach yoga and a hot mud soak.

The vibe now is less seedy watering hole, more claustrophobe-celeb. The clipboard-clutching assistant on the sidewalk serves as an ominous reminder that reservations are nearly impossible to obtain; the fortunate few might be granted admittance to drink at the bar and hope a table opens up.</p><p data-wc="179" word_count="179">The wait isn’t much mitigated by the cacophonous crush at the bar, where courtly gentlemen serve complicated drinks that convey the modern-nostalgic speakeasy ethos: the Dodd Cocktail, a froth of Basil Hayden’s bourbon, La Fée absinthe, peach bitters, lemon, and egg white, is more fun to read about than to drink. But once you land a table, good things start to happen. On the bistro-style menu, the rightful star is the much talked about $26 Black Label burger, a custom blend of dry-aged rib eye, skirt steak, and brisket from the Pat La Frieda meat company, which is seared, bathed in clarified butter, and topped with caramelized onions—cheese is not recommended—on a Balthazar Bakery bun. (There is also a “regular” burger, for $16, made of what used to be La Frieda’s “premium” blend.) The burger is a deal compared to the decent, if not transporting, dry-aged <em>côte de boeuf</em> for two (the same rib eye used in the Black Label burger, for $90), which comes with heavenly roasted bone marrow and a meagre sucrine-lettuce salad. </p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">Other dishes are, for the most part, exquisitely executed, including a bracing <em>salade de pissenlit</em>, dandelion greens, egg, and anchovy dressing; <em>crème billi bi</em>, a subtle mussel soup (the recipe is adapted from Maxim’s, in Paris); and, for an entrée, delicate trout meunière or a robust guinea-hen special, stuffed with foie gras, sweetbreads, and chanterelles. Although the room starts to feel like a pressure cooker at times, and the staff occasionally betrays a note of mild desperation (there’s barely anywhere for them to stand), for the most part, they keep it together, because, as one lovely waitress said, “There’s no crying in baseball.” (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/29/armani-ristorante	Armani / Ristorante	717 Fifth Ave., at 56th St. 	null	null	null	2009/06/29	<p class="noindent" data-wc="244" word_count="244">Armani / 5th Avenue, according to the company literature, is supposed to be a “concept store,” and Armani / Ristorante, housed on its third floor, above suits, ties, candles, umbrellas, pillows, vases, cosmetics, watches, and ice buckets, is supposed to be a “unique dining experience.” In other words, every mall needs a food court. This one is more outwardly slinky than most. Not long after noon, on a recent Wednesday, a lone man, with strands of gray pearls wrapped around his wrist, toyed with a flute of champagne and stared into the distance. He would have had a great view of Fifth Avenue had the restaurant’s designers not chosen to shroud its windows in mesh shades. The strands of green, blue, and red bulbs lining the glass didn’t seem very Armani. Neither did projections of the skyline onto random floors and lavatory doors—aren’t cityscapes Donna Karan’s thing? The restaurant is every bit a brand extension, so it seemed strange that Armani’s brand of impeccability didn’t extend to the menus (which were beat-up), the central white staircase (dirty, scratched), or the reservations system (a piece of loose-leaf paper, apparently). At the bar, a manager and a bartender argued, loudly. The dispute seemed to be about a pen. Their passion did not extend to a pair of women who were waiting for a table, or, once the women were seated, to their full glasses of wine, paid for and awaiting transferral.</p><p data-wc="223" word_count="223">The consulting chef at Armani / Ristorante is Lorenzo Viani, who became friends with Giorgio Armani, the literature notes, “after Mr. Armani dined at Viani’s Michelin-starred Ristorante Lorenzo, in the seaside town of Forte dei Marmi in northern Tuscany.” Viani’s specialty is seafood—a decent risotto with prawns and cabbage, slightly gritty scallops. One patron, a banker whose conversation spanned credit-default swaps to “cardio,” said that he ate at Armani often: “It’s not a male lunch place, or an estrogen-fest. It’s balanced.” The food, too, has an appealing discretion, but it can border on sterile. The tagliatelle with tomato sauce is pure and unexuberant. It is exactly what it says it is. Sea bass is just that: nice white fish on a nice white plate. Viani’s quiet unities are missing from other parts of the menu. There are few enticing salads, a miscalculation given the crowd. One salad, involving shaved artichokes, is lifeless enough to require both salt and pepper and some olive oil, filched from the bread plate. There’s a dolci counter on the way out, offering Armani pralines and fruit jellies, but the way they’re presented—under glass, like accessories or specimens—doesn’t really make you feel like splurging.

He is tired of hearing Americans say that they prefer Barcelona. Fortunately for his dining companions, regional chauvinism does not come into play at La Fonda del Sol, which is so broadly Spanish (“modern”) as to include accents of old colonies and rival powers. The chef, Josh DeChellis, who was born in Colombia and reared in New Jersey, achieved mixed results with other national cuisines at other restaurants, but seems to have found his muse.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">La Fonda del Sol, above Grand Central Terminal, is a revival, in name only, of the old kitschy Joe Baum Latin emporium in the Time-Life Building. It has a casual, airy bar area for tapas—if it is reminiscent of an airport lounge, as some have remarked, then it is more like one at the soaring new Richard Rogers terminal at Barajas—and a formal dining room, with Iberian maroons and arty photographs of matadors.</p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">Authenticity, as per Spain, would require a late dinner, but, as per Manhattan, would rule out such proximity to Grand Central so deep into the evening. The Spaniard, therefore, agreed to a leisurely lunch. Judging the<em> jamón</em> to be merely decent, he said, “I have fantastic <em>jamón</em> from Madrid in my home. You are welcome to come over.” Appetizers of octopus (buttery tentacular nickels atop potato pesetas) and razor clams (sprinkled with chorizo) were textural marvels. Among the tapas, the genuine blandness of the salt-cod <em>croquetas</em> helped ameliorate the goutiness brought on by a rich little pot of duckling, pork, and sherry, and, from the next round, lamb dressed with hot peppers and roasted on a bed of grass from the field in which the lamb once grazed. The dinner version of this dish is stewed in yogurt made with the milk of the lamb’s mother. (We call it . . . the Aristocrats!) Far into a fine Rioja, the Spaniard, pining for a nap but condemned to an Anglo-Saxon law-office afternoon, rued the absence on the menu of a delicacy called <em>mollejas</em>—sweetbreads. Still, he rated the meal an eight out of ten. “Pretty high for New York, yes?” (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $24-$39.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Can I get you a glass of wine?” The waiters moved briskly behind the marble-topped bar, neatly attired in white shirts, aprons, and plaid bow ties. At one end of the room, the charcuterie mistress tended her meat slicer; at the other, a stuffed boar’s head grinned from the wall. Gottino makes the most of its narrow space; the high pressed-tin ceiling gives the place an airiness, while the yellow tiles and pale wood behind the bar give it a lightness. You get the feeling that the patrons really care about wine, so it was hard not to feel a bit silly ordering the prosecco with strawberries and basil, which, though fresh and filled with delightfully chunky bits of berry, was undeniably pink. And it certainly wasn’t meant to go with the food, which is anything but a lark. Wild-boar pâté, for instance, was textured and complex, both spicy and sweet; crostini with “pearls of prosciutto,” Parmesan, and a grape <em>mosto</em> had a smoky elegance. Even vegetables took a twist: beets, bathed in crème fraîche, arrived in the crisp parchment packet in which they were roasted, along with hazelnuts. Downstairs, on the way to the rest room, a pantry is set as a cornucopia: a platter piled high with artichokes, overflowing baskets of walnuts, metal buckets of onions and potatoes, and a basin of corks, topped by a watermelon. </p><p data-wc="209" word_count="209">   At Wilfie &amp; Nell, a gastropub a few blocks south, the room is a chaotic mixture of J. Crew and American Apparel, management consultants standing at the bar, the actress Martha Plimpton at a table near the door. Those wanting a seat need a keen eye and ruthless elbows: it’s first come, first served, and there’s no list. Here the ceiling is low, and the room has the dark, claustrophobic dampness of an English pub. The waitress, dressed in clingy black, with an eggbeater tattoo on her wrist, wends her way through the crowd with a sweet nonchalance. The food is meant to sop up the beer: pigs in a blanket, though the blanket is bacon; a buttery grilled cheese, made with tangy Gruyère and caramelized onions; neat little pork sliders, with the perfect ratio of meat to bun. Still, it dawns on you that, although the menu was assembled by Joaquin Baca, who also helped mastermind the Momofuku empire, the food is beside the point. One patron summed it up: “The service is terrible, but the waitress is super hot.” (Gottino is open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and weekends for brunch and dinner; dishes $5-$14.

According to “The Oxford Companion to Food,” rice, in the Islamic tradition, was a sacred dish. Later, it evolved into a staple of Spanish cooking, particularly in the form of paella, a casserole that can include any number of things (among them, almost always, saffron and olive oil) and is cooked, without exception, in a two-handled cast-iron pan. In Valencia, where paella is said to have originated, the pan was the table: each person would pull up a chair and carve out a triangle of rice, eating until he met his companions in the middle. At Socarrat, which serves eight versions of the dish at a narrow, stylish bar, under the gaze of the figures in fragmented reproductions of “Las Meninas,” the methodology is scattershot but the challenge is the same: every last grain. Handsome waiters are happy to help, and you’ll be happy to let them, but scraping the <em>socarrat</em>—the caramelized rice at the bottom of the pan—yourself is a wiser way to win the Clean Pan Club race.</p><p data-wc="180" word_count="180">   First, though, there is sangria: slightly cinnamony, not too sweet. And there are tapas, satisfying but undistinguished, as befits the cuisine of perhaps the only country in the world where it is desirable to serve food that comes in a can. The hotter plates are the better ones: sizzling <em>gambas al ajillo</em>, <em>canelones</em> blistered with little bubbles of char. The paellas are meant for two or more, depending on how big you like your piece of the pie. The Valenciana version suffers a bit for its lack of saffron and a surfeit of grease; here, the nuggets of rabbit loin are the buried treasure. The Paella Socarrat is a livelier mélange, incorporating chicken, fish, beef, shrimp, mussels, clams, and—why not?—green beans. The duelling spoons stay on for <em>graxonera</em> cheesecake, a cause for a creamy fight to the death in a cast-iron pan. <em>Fideuas</em>—one with mussels, another with shrimp—substitute crispy noodles for rice as the underpinning element. What if the Moors had made it to China? (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Paellas $18-$23 per person.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/25/bar-breton	Bar Breton	254 Fifth Ave., at 28th St. 	null	null	null	2009/05/25	<p class="noindent" data-wc="162" word_count="162">Good food can be found in perplexing places, and this casual French bistro, opened not long ago by the chef Cyril Renaud, sits in what must be Manhattan’s last characterless quarter—an area that some maps sheepishly call Midtown South Central, a grungy zone between Koreatown and the Flatiron district that’s quiet in a decaying, rather than leafy and cloistered, kind of way. Across the street from Bar Breton, there’s a Quiznos, and, above, the refulgent Salon Santa Cruz. Inside, Renaud has constructed a cozy homage to his native Brittany, complete with faux fireplace, but, incongruously, a flat-screen TV hangs over the bar. The other night, a basketball game between the Celtics and the Bulls enhanced the feeling that this latest venture by Renaud, who has been nominated for a James Beard award and who for nearly a decade ran the Michelin-star-rated (and recently closed) Fleur de Sel, is akin to Michael Jordan suiting up for the Washington Wizards.</p><p data-wc="234" word_count="234">   This is happy news for the diner. Although the service at Bar Breton can be erratic (and if you’re unfortunate enough to be wedged into one of the booths up front, you’ll yearn for a middle-of-the-row coach seat), Renaud’s menu is packed with marvellous, intricately rendered things, popping with clever ingredients and fresh flavors. The wine list is substantial; there are two dozen bottles under thirty dollars, and most of the entrées, too, are amiably priced. The galette—a crêpe made with buckwheat flour—is king in Brittany, and Renaud offers an enticing panoply of them, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The saying may be “<em>Plat comme une galette</em>” (as flat as a galette), but Renaud stuffs his with the likes of lamb shank, smoked salmon, and Black Forest ham. One, with crab meat and Parmesan gratin, was compared to “a really delicious tuna melt”—an insult to the crab, perhaps, but a compliment to the chef. Some dishes disappoint: a pork chop was a tad dry; a salmon filet undercooked. The excellent appetizers and desserts, though, guarantee that the meal begins and ends exactly where you want it. Recently, a patron described the arugula-and-mushroom salad, dressed just right with lemon vinaigrette, as “summer in a bowl,” while the gorgeous banana profiteroles took everybody’s eyes off the TV. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $12-$28.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Some may turn out to be engaged in the productive and viable business of feeding people, but it will emerge that many, based on blind optimism and unacceptable levels of risk, are stuck with assets (and food) that are undoubtedly toxic. Delicatessen isn’t the worst of them, but it demonstrates many of the faults of the neighborhood: style over substance, a poorly designed menu, and indifferent execution. </p><p data-wc="209" word_count="209">   As the name suggests, Delicatessen is a jokey homage to the old Jewish deli—pastrami on wry—though the concept doesn’t extend much further than pastrami and Reuben sandwiches. (A matzo-ball soup was dropped some months back.) Instead, the restaurant’s guiding principle, proclaimed on its menu, is “international comfort food,” which means easy, predictable dishes with little twists here and there. One such twist comes in cheeseburger spring rolls, a dish that sounds so misconceived you feel you have to try it. Without the tangy vegetable component of regular spring rolls, there is nothing to relieve the fatty blandness of wrapper, meat, and cheese. When you bite into one end, grease spills out of the other. One would have to be very drunk to enjoy this dish, and, to that purpose, the cocktails here are excellent. Similarly, the mac and cheese appears to be exactly that: pasta soused in melted cheese with no evidence of any attempt to create a sauce. Mahimahi is over-salted and no match for the garlic in a side of sticky rice. Such inversions abound: a dish of mustard arrives atop a pork chop, accompanied by a helping of salt with a hint of kale and a side of butter garnished with grits.</p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">   But the food isn’t really the point here. If Topshop were a restaurant, it would be this restaurant. The menu features pictures of random people in a style suggestive of Polaroids taken at a party. Downstairs is a lounge with low couches, low lighting, and a d.j. who keeps music pounding throughout the restaurant. At a recent Sunday brunch, the club-ready waitstaff—all Mohicans and triceps and tattoos—sang along to A-ha and George Harrison and danced as they went about their work. People enjoyed the display, and, for all its faults, Delicatessen has judged its market well. One quiet evening, a man eating alone spoke highly of the place and said that he was a regular. His girth gave some indication of the effects of such a regimen. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $11-$27). <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

The result, in the Thompson Hotel LES, is named Shang, and its menu takes in Lee’s early years in Hong Kong, where he lived until he was twenty, the multicultural influences of Ontario, and his three-year sojourn in Singapore. Even if there’s a sense that many of the diners are hotel guests, it’s still a pretty chic crowd—girls with eyelid-skimming bangs, men with kaffiyehs wrapped around their necks. Only the odd towheaded toddler gives the game away. </p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">    Back in Toronto, Lee was famous for his tasting menu, which turned the concept of course progression upside down. If you start with small things, Lee reasoned, people will be too full to appreciate the heartier courses at the end. So meals at Susur went from main dish to appetizer to fish to soup to dessert. At Shang, the menu is à la carte, and the sense of progression, in either direction, appears absent. The philosophy, instead, seems to be to stuff them early <em>and</em> late. Sizable dishes included the Singapore Slaw, billed as the restaurant’s signature, a towering mountain of julienned vegetables, fried taro, and hazelnuts, mixed table-side, with an addictive salted-plum dressing. A thin cap of crispy potato hid golf-ball-size vegetable dumplings, packed with rich, flavorful greens, mushrooms, and corn. </p><p data-wc="171" word_count="171">    The fact that most of what arrived was delicious became a double-edged sword—it took an iron will to try to save room. It was worth it, though, since by far the best dish on the menu came late: rosy lamb chops that could be cut with a butter knife, with a peanut sauce good enough to spoon up by itself. At the end of a recent dinner, Lee himself, tall, elegantly slim, with his hair pulled back into a ponytail, stopped by the table to remark on how much remained of an order of duck, breaded with taro and served with savory pillowy pancakes. (“We just ordered too much,” the table protested. Lee replied, “I noticed.”) He happily shared his technique for producing a gorgeous octopus salad. “We take the tentacles, and wrap them tightly, and leave them overnight. And then, like a sausage, we slice them very thin.” He paused for a moment, and asked, “Do you cook at home?” (Open daily for breakfast and dinner.

The diorama includes salvaged organ pipes, and, in the bathroom, peonies in a jam jar and patina on the faucet. The restaurant is situated in the middle of a semi-deserted cobblestoned block in Vinegar Hill, down which one can picture scamps in suspenders rolling wooden hoops. There is neither a sign nor a vestibule, and a person stumbling in early, before sepia-toned bonhomie sets in, can get the feeling of having missed a secret password. Unless you order a bottle, expect the wine to come in tumblers; if only some cultural anthropologist could explain when, and why, wineglasses became so retro-passé. Recently, certain spirits seem to have been banished to the future. “Vodka doesn’t really lend itself to cocktailing,” a bartender explained.</p><p data-wc="210" word_count="210">    The vintage act can get to be a bit much, but Vinegar Hill’s prices—nine dollars for an appetizer of mussels, eleven for a ravioli entrée—redeem its pretensions. They also, along with the small kitchen, limit its ambitions. The menu generally features five appetizers and four entrées, some with overlapping ingredients: order the cheese-and-salami plate, and, a few bites later, encounter the cheese and the walnuts, with veggies, reconstituted as elements in a green-bean salad. A vegetable-ricotta tart is wan and soggy; the chicken-liver mousse is good; shrimp, with their heads on, and tossed with fried shallots, are better. As for the entrées, the easy stuff—pastas and pork chops—occasionally flop, while filet of trout, which seems like less of a sure thing, comes out perfectly cooked. The signature dish, the chicken, arrives in a cast-iron skillet, which a waiter sets down on a grubby pot holder. The steam creates an odd, bonglike effect—hits of sherry vinegar—but, once you get past that, the meat is moist and the skin is crisp. The chocolate Guinness cake might explain all the flannel shirts—working your way through the cream-cheese icing is like shovelling a snowdrift. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/04/27/schnippers-quality-kitchen	Schnipper’s Quality Kitchen	620 Eighth Ave., at 41st St. 	null	null	null	2009/04/27	<p class="noindent" data-wc="170" word_count="170">Generally, if a diner’s first thought when trying a new restaurant is, Is this a chain?, the subsequent meal proves to be, if a little boring, pleasantly safe—reassuring whether in New York, Kansas City, or Seattle. Schnipper’s Quality Kitchen, which opened recently in the ground floor of the Times building, has all the hallmarks of a franchise-ready operation: a crisp aesthetic that utilizes three colors (Venetian red, sky blue, silver); bathrooms that are accessible only with a code; a slogan that declares “‘Quality’ Is Our Middle Name!” The capstone here is a rectangular pocket-size pager that alerts you, by blinking and vibrating and squawking like a novice duck caller, that your food is up. Depending on your mood, it evokes either a Taser or a certain electrical device that nineteenth-century doctors used to alleviate female hysteria. Although owners Andrew and Jonathan Schnipper deny that their new place is a fast-food joint—and so far it’s the only outlet—at first impression, it sure feels like one.</p><p data-wc="253" word_count="253">    Schnipper’s took root a few years ago, when, in the spirit of Jane and Michael Stern, the brothers travelled around the country in search of great roadside fare. Upon return, they devised a menu of their favorites. There’s a green-chile cheeseburger from New Mexico, some fish tacos from San Diego, and a chicken club courtesy of the Rockies (they are good there, evidently). Most of the “classics” were left untouched (“How can you beat a New York hot dog?” Andrew says), but others got some gussying up—one burger, for example, comes with arugula, and the best fries are sweet potato. The sandwiches—mozzarella and tomato, veggies and goat cheese, to name the artsier ones—are built around ciabatta, sourdough, or multigrain bread. The salads are substantial, not too heavily dressed, and involve figs and beets and toasted pine nuts. Sweets take the form of more than a dozen milkshakes, any of which leaves you blissfully lethargic. (One made with salted caramel inspired a recent diner to wonder who in the world doesn’t love a great shake. Echoing the glory days of the roadside café, he answered his own question: “Communists.”) Yet, even amid all of this, it’s hard to escape the fact that one can only do so much to empower food prepared on a flattop grill. You’ve got to wonder about the quality of a compliment often overheard at Schnipper’s: “It’s better than fast food.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

As the Zeitgeist caught up with itself, waterfront glass towers were erected, artists were priced out of the neighborhood, and dressed-up joints like Dressler and DuMont, Hotel Delmano, and Marlow &amp; Sons moved in. (This wasn’t a bad thing, culinarily speaking, but it was more expensive.) And thus a couple of Manhattanites, Dylan Dodd (of Barrio Chino) and Danny Minch (a former Balthazar bartender), opened Walter Foods, part bistro, part old-school chophouse.</p><p data-wc="256" word_count="256">     At the handsome bar, cordial gentlemen dole out an eclectic list of well-crafted classics such as the tropical cliché the Singapore Sling—a mix of gin, pineapple, and Luxardo, a maraschino liqueur—and a bourbon-heavy mint julep, just right. The bar is a fine place for a clever appetizer, like the pig in a blanket (chorizo wrapped in pastry) or the spot-on buffalo lollipop chicken wings. The dining-room ambience is pure New England, with its dark wood-beamed ceiling, antiquey prints of fishermen, and leather-cushioned booths, and the waiters, in their starched white aprons and bow ties, convey an air of formality that is propagated by the menu of the chef, Justin Ernsberger (Clinton Street Baking Company). One night, the raw bar offered pristine Beau Soleil, Hama Hama, Malpeque, and Blue Point oysters, king crab, and plump shrimp cocktail. But the clam chowder had a wan broth of buttered milk, and the blackened shrimp was oversalted. Lobster salad was luscious with avocado and hearts of palm but swimming in dressing, albeit a light, citrusy vinaigrette. The fried chicken, served with an addictive honey-chile dipping sauce, was too dark—“truculent, not succulent,” said one diner—but a perfectly seared salmon fillet with French lentils and beurre blanc solved the mystery of why such a banal-sounding dish was on the specials board. The burger was distractingly smoky, inside an insufficient bun, but the filet mignon, with a decadent peppercorn-cream sauce, was charred to such perfection that it seemed to challenge Peter Luger, not far away, to a steak throwdown.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">     In spite of all the stiff-fronted decorum, the erstwhile Billyburg ethos seems to thrive. Amidst a dull Saturday-night roar, the urbane servers had, at times, an air of bewilderment; the clientele favored beards, T-shirts and jeans, tattoo sleeves. A young couple sat at the bar feeding each other: on one plate, the French dip ($18), on the other, surf and turf ($44). (Open daily for dinner and on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch.

There are the ascetics, who demand pies as thin and brittle as Communion wafers, versus the libertines, who prefer something they can sink their teeth into. If anyone can persuade the quarrellers to break bread, it’s surely Jim Lahey, of Co. A rookie on the New York pizza scene, Lahey is an expert on crust. The Italian peasant loaves produced by his Sullivan Street Bakery are a mainstay of breadbaskets all over town; no less a fan than Jean-Georges Vongerichten has become a Lahey business partner. After years of anticipation, Co. (pronounced “Company”) finally opened in January, and pizza lovers of all persuasions have queued up outside the door since Day One.</p><p data-wc="308" word_count="308">     Inside, long communal tables are ideally suited for diplomacy. The décor, like the menu, is casual but refined, all white walls and blond wood panelling; the atmosphere doesn’t scream “pizzeria,” but, then, Lahey is refreshingly impious about all kinds of traditions. At Sullivan Street, for example, his bread is never kneaded, and Co.’s screw-top-only wine list is a geographic hodgepodge ranging from Austria to Oregon, with nary a grappa to be found. Dogmatists might think it gratuitous, even heretical, to serve soup at a pizza joint, but Lahey’s <em>ribollita</em>—a kind of Tuscan minestrone with bread—is good enough to inspire zealots of its own. A salad of butter lettuce, squash, and pumpkin seeds is also terrific, but why bother when you can get more than your R.D.A. of leafy greens on the <em>stracciatella</em> pizza, piled with a mountain of fresh arugula? Come to think of it, you might order two, just to be safe. Beneath the arugula there’s a smattering of crushed tomato, a healthy dose of black pepper, and a savory lode of <em>stracciatella</em> cheese. It’s so good that you may not want to branch out, but don’t overlook the <em>boscaiola</em>; with sausage, mushroom, and buffalo mozzarella, it’s a spicy, grown-up take on the classic delivery pie. (Lahey has said he envisions Co. as “Pizza Hut meets Blue Hill.”) Not every item is so successful—what’s with all the béchamel?—but it’s hard to quibble with the crust. Thin but not dry, crisp yet springy, it offers something for everyone—a middle way that doesn’t feel like triangulation. When the definitive history is written, Co. may be remembered as the site of the Chelsea Pizza Accords. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner, and Sundays for brunch and dinner.

Two dapper men in three-piece suits with matching pocket squares raised their glasses to a young lady, who struggled to remember the relevant Italian: “<em>Saluche</em>?” The manager greeted guests by name, slung his arms around shoulders, kissed cheeks. It was louche and loose and lots of fun. </p><p data-wc="286" word_count="286">     Once you’re seated, in one of the two-person booths by the bar or back in the dining room (which feels vaguely illicit, thanks to diaphanous red curtains), the evening proceeds with a pleasant insouciance. “So we’ve got great Belgian beers, blah, blah, blah,” a waiter, trilby perched on the back of his head, said. “If you have any questions, don’t ask me. I don’t know anything about it.” Luckily, the menu is pretty straightforward: French, with a nod to American comfort food. Risotto fritters arrived stacked in a pyramid, crispy on the outside, a little gummy inside; their only real failing was a cold tomato sauce. Sautéed wild mushrooms, fragrantly woodsy, in a heap atop a slice of brioche, were flawless. The salmon tartare was a bit bland until tasted in the same bite as the salty, scallion-flecked mini-latkes that accompanied it. With the entrées, it seemed that the simple—black linguine with roasted-tomato sauce, a nicely cooked burger—trumped the complex. “Pekin” duck, for instance, didn’t pay off: the fowl was a little pasty, the sweet potatoes too sweet, the mushrooms tacked on. But an almost clichéd entrée of braised short ribs—tender meat straddling a creamy white puddle of mashed potatoes and a dark-green mass of Swiss chard—was fantastic, and appeared, according to an informal poll, to be the regulars’ favorite. When a diner couldn’t quite clean his plate, he let the waiter know that it was only because of the limits of his appetite, not the quality of the food. “You don’t have to tell me,” the waiter replied. “I know it’s good.” (Open daily for dinner.

Within months, he had left the restaurant, Atlas. His next job, at Papillon, lasted only a year. Then there was his stint at Gilt, which people thought was brilliant, and which didn’t last long, either. After a couple of years cooking privately, Liebrandt is probably sick of having to relive his temperamental youth. Suffice it to say that he once helped stage a dinner where blindfolded guests ate jelly off a naked woman. At Corton, which Liebrandt has conceived with the veteran restaurateur Drew Nieporent as “three-star dining stripped down,” the mood is clean and bright. With starry light fixtures in irregular shapes (one resembles a wand dipped in sparkling honey) and pristine white walls embossed with designs in the shape of tree branches, it could be a planetarium designed by Apple. One recent Friday night, a banquette toward the front of the room was occupied by no less a futurist than the Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein.</p><p data-wc="227" word_count="227">What’s surprising about Corton is the levity that Liebrandt—whom Gael Greene once called “the prince of discomfort food”—brings to the table. An amuse-bouche of foie-gras chantilly turns its stodgy components loose: served in a tiny bowl and layered like a sundae, it is light, heavy, springy, and crunchy all at once. For an appetizer of cod, squid, chorizo, and a slow-cooked farm egg, the waiter pours a little pitcher of pheasant consommé over the whole speckled mixture, making it sing in the manner of bubble and squeak. The squid is submerged in the soupiness, as though it’s under the sea—a witty take. That impression, and the dish’s complexity, deepens as lukewarm foam on top gives way to a warmer, tidal broth. Liebrandt’s cooking is the culinary equivalent of wordplay—an intellectual exercise cloaked in amusement—and, just occasionally, such as when he dresses up a foie-gras appetizer with a ruby-red skin of hibiscus-beet gelée, like a plum, he succumbs to the superfluous joke. Far more often, his japes are a pleasure. A coconut sorbet with dried currants and lime is a rum-raisin-flavored game of hide-and-seek. Petits fours come in Lucite boxes, bringing to mind pieces of costume jewelry, which, like Corton, is dazzling and not too heavy. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Three-course prix-fixe menu $79, tasting menu around $120.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Its name refers to the stretch of water between Governors Island and Brooklyn (there’s a helpful map on the back of the menu). The décor is simple—an unadorned brick wall, paned windows, two big mirrors—though there are touches of whimsy: a goldfish bowl on a shelf above the bar, draped with a dog tag (“Ackerman”), its lone inhabitant circling underneath a miniature disco ball. The prices are reasonable, the beers are from New York state, and there’s a Merlot made by Brooklyn Oenology, based in Greenpoint (“They don’t actually grow the grapes there,” a waitress noted). The bathroom harbors a poster for “Cowboy from Brooklyn” (Dick Powell, Priscilla Lane, Ronald Reagan), which might be more instructive than intended. It’s the story of a man pretending to be something he is not; there’s a sense, at times, that Buttermilk Channel works awfully hard to appear effortlessly congenial. You can’t fault the restaurant for popularity, but a three-hour wait for a table doesn’t seem very neighborly.</p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">Despite the friendliness of the staff and the owner, Doug Crowell, who is an indefatigably cheerful presence, the feeling persists on the scattershot menu—fried chicken and waffles here, herb-crusted hake there. The former was juicy, though the exterior was almost tooth-shatteringly crunchy, and the accompanying cheddar waffles were spongy, as if they had languished under a heat lamp. The latter was splendid: delicate but firm, set in a thick savory stew of linguica and kale. Once you notice it, dissonance is everywhere. The duck meat loaf, with creamed spinach and duck jus (“You’ve got to get all of it together in one bite,” the waitress advised), was rich and complex, but jarringly overshadowed by an enormous onion ring. There’s much that is superb: a big, chewy burger, with aggressively sharp cheddar and sweet grilled onions; a flaky squash tart, with layers of buttery pastry and creamy ricotta. Other dishes fall flat: a special of rabbit had an unpleasantly persistent vanilla undertone; chunks of smoked bacon overwhelmed the creamy cauliflower-and-apple soup. </p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">Homeliness reigns on the dessert menu: apple-cider doughnuts, a root-beer float, oatmeal-raisin cookies. The standout is diabolically simple—the gooey interior of pecan pie, wedged between layers of soft butter-pecan ice cream and topped with whipped cream. It’s named after Crowell, and the waitress comes equipped with the backstory. “His family doesn’t like pecan pie, so growing up he never got to eat it. But now he owns a restaurant.” (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner, Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $11-$20.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Tracy Williams, Ltd., has decorated nearly every inch of 10 Downing Food &amp; Wine with pricey works of contemporary art by people such as Will Cotton and Shamus Clisset. Diners proclaim things like “Oh my God, I’d hang any of these in my apartment,” and, fittingly, a yellow-and-black drawing by Matt Mullican incorporates the declaration “I love to work for Truth and Beauty.” It seems the owners have flipped an old real-estate trick on its head: it’s not sweet smells from the kitchen that make the place more appealing, but rather the beauty of the layout that enhances the food. 10 Downing has quickly attracted a glossy clientele—nightly throngs of big bags, skinny jeans, and suspicious looks up and down. Whitney Port’s “The City” has filmed there. It’s reservation hell.</p><p data-wc="180" word_count="180">      Purgatory, meanwhile, is where 10 Downing’s chef, Jason Neroni, has found himself lately, looking to expiate the sins of his culinary past. Over the last two years, Neroni has been busted for soliciting votes for a James Beard award via e-mail (pride), been accused by a former boss of petty larceny (avarice, though he says the charges were dismissed), and introduced the world to the pork margarita (gluttony). If some of his cooking here—vaguely pan-European, with prawns <em>a la plancha,</em> duck-meatball cassoulet, and gnocchi pocked with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms—comes off seeming restrained, you can’t blame him. Still, among recent starters, the smokiness of a delicious sunchoke soup was keenly tempered with a dollop of whipped crème fraîche, while a bowl of roasted Brussels sprouts included a delightful breaded poached egg. The squid-ink <em>agnolotti</em> with peekytoe crab was certainly clever, though awfully fishy. A lamb shank, big enough for a Neanderthal, proved somehow tender but not succulent. Both the duck and the rib eye showed up rare, the former infused with flavor, the latter choked in fat.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">      So many guests choose to endure 10 Downing’s sizable wait times that the restaurant’s sliver of a bar area often becomes a kind of holding paddock. To pass the time the other night, a young woman took to sketching the row of artisanal-beer taps in front of her. With the right frame, the drawing could have hung on the walls, too.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/09/lartusi	L’Artusi	228 W. 10th St. 	29.7887327142857	-95.3993072857143	212-255-5757	2009/03/09	<p data-wc="89" word_count="89">In 1891, Pellegrino Artusi, at the age of seventy-one, having retired from the silk trade, published an exhaustive, droll cookbook spanning every region of his newly unified Italy, “Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well”—an Italian “Joy of Cooking,” with attitude. (From the preface: “Cooking is a troublesome sprite. . . . I may discreetly assume that my dishes have been generally well received, and that to my great fortune few people, thus far, have cursed me for stomach aches or other phenomena that decency forbids me to mention.”) </p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">In adopting his name for their follow-up to Dell’Anima, the chef Gabe Thompson and the sommelier Joe Campanale portend substance and variety, home cooking for the soul. While the clever menu mirrors, if refractively, its namesake’s philosophies, the décor has an identity crisis. A dimly lit splatter-painted gray brick wall gives way to a sort of Upper East Side dining corridor, with a Ralph Lauren Home-style wide-striped ceiling and red-chintz-and-ticking-stripe upholstery. In the back, a bright-white subway-tiled open kitchen is edged with a long marble bar, where diners are encouraged to watch the crudo apprentices in action. (Artusi: “Pity those ladies who receive guests in semi-darkness, and in whose homes you stumble into the furniture and know not where to put your hat.”)</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Artusi’s improvisatory spirit is certainly evident in Thompson’s modern-meets-classics roster of “medium plates.” Among the pleasing crudos were pristine Nantucket Bay scallops, folded with creamy sweet <em>uni</em> and bitter flecks of preserved lemon; less successful was the tuna with beet cubes, too much mineral darkness in one bite. The <em>otoro</em> with <em>lardo </em>on mini-toast was fun, as were several sublimely rustic pastas, such as the <em>pizzoccheri</em>, buckwheat pasta ribbons baked with a salty mélange of sage, Fontina, and Brussels sprouts, and an exemplary spaghetti and meatballs. (Artusi: “Do not think for a moment that I would be so pretentious as to tell you how to make meatballs. This is a dish that everyone knows how to make, beginning with the jackass.”) </p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">There is much talk of indigestion in “Science in the Kitchen,” and Thompson might do well to heed Artusi’s guidance, as some of his dishes, though delicious—a perfectly rare “deckle” steak; rich <em>zeppole</em> stuffed with braised octopus—left one feeling as if a pound of butter had been consumed. But the last word should go to Artusi: “Passion, care, and precision of method will certainly suffice . . . I, after all, cannot presume to have reached the acme of perfection.” (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $14-$24.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/02/the-john-dory	The John Dory	85 Tenth Ave., at 15th St. 	null	null	null	2009/03/02	<p data-wc="125" word_count="125">It’s been five years since April Bloomfield, a young British chef, introduced New York to the hearty, calorific joys of English gastropub food, with the Spotted Pig, in the West Village. Now comes a fish restaurant, and, with it, the opportunity to discover how amphibious her talent is. Can a chef known for a Roquefort-smothered burger and creative use of offal pay adequate heed to the more delicate flavors of the sea? What happens when you swap triglycerides for omega-3 fatty acids? The jury’s still out on this, but the John Dory certainly has the feel of a success. The menu is provocative enough to get foodies interested, and the spectacle, buzz, and flavor draw in the social flotsam of the meatpacking district.</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">Bloomfield, rather than being reined in by the restaurant’s focus, tends to treat fish as she does meat, and her impressive execution and defiant wit mostly carry it off. Arctic char impersonates steak, seared very rare and accompanied with béarnaise sauce and frites; monkfish liver pretends to be foie gras, a whole lobe of it dripping in brown butter and served with brioche toast. In a dish of grilled squid, the sepia tails are basically sausage casings, stuffed with a spicy mix of chorizo and rice. The bold flavors feel supremely confident, but sometimes you wonder if it wouldn’t be even more confident to let fish be fish occasionally. The eponymous John Dory, which feeds two, is a case in point, with an overpowering salsa verde. But if you ask for the salsa on the side, the freshness of the fish and the excellence of its preparation—rich, but just short of buttery—become apparent.</p><p data-wc="170" word_count="170">The décor, like the food, goes for a more-is-more approach. Nearly every square inch of the room is plastered with piscine decoration, as if it had been hit by a tsunami of seaside souvenirs. The walls are encrusted with garish plastic salmon, mahi-mahi, lobsters, and other creatures of the deep; there are posters of North American fish, Australian fish, and mollusks; there are mirrors whose frames are clusters of shells. An orderly school of remarkably lifelike fishermen’s lures are frozen mid-swim in the clear resin countertop of the bar. Behind the bar is a large tank of colorful tropical fish. They’re not on the menu, but you begin to fear for their morale. One night, a waiter revealed that, until recently, there had been an eel in the tank that committed suicide by swimming up a filtration tube.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/02/23/txikito	Txikito	240 Ninth Ave., at 25th St. 	null	null	null	2009/02/23	<p data-wc="114" word_count="114">First, the obligatory name exegesis: it’s pronounced “chee-kee-toe,” meaning “little” in Euskara, the Basque language. People make a big deal over the tic-tac-toe phonetics—“All I ask is that you name the restaurant something that’s a little easier to pronounce and spell,” Ed Levine wrote, on the Web site Serious Eats—but is Txikito really any trickier to say than La Grenouille, or ’Cesca? And isn’t it more exciting to order a <em>txiki txanpi</em> than a mini shrimp-and-mushroom grilled cheese? New Yorkers, at least, seem to think so. “It’s no surprise that its long front bar and cozy seating area fills up fast,” according to Zagat, however you say that.</p><p data-wc="266" word_count="266">Txikito serves small plates, divided into three categories. There are <em>beroak</em>, which are hot items; <em>hotzak</em>, which are cold items (O.K., that’s confusing); and <em>pintxoak</em>, which are Basque finger foods—little spreads and sandwiches that are traditionally, though not here, held together with toothpicks. (<em>Pincho</em> means “thorn” in Spanish.) They’re just bites, and almost all of them are, along with a glass of cinnamony <em>zurra</em>, a tantalizing way to start a meal. The best is <em>arraultza</em>, a round of baguette topped with sofrito, chorizo, and a perfectly fried quail egg: deli breakfast on a doll-house scale. The <em>hotzak</em> section is weaker, with the exception of octopus carpaccio, spiced with red pepper and beautifully carved to resemble an open chrysanthemum, or fish scales. Skip the insubstantial escarole salad, for eleven dollars; the poached Navarran leeks with chopped egg and an undetectable black-truffle vinaigrette; the forgettable green beans. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with them, but at these portions and prices—it’s at least six plates to a full stomach—a lacklustre dish feels like a squandered opportunity, especially when the <em>beroak</em> portion of the menu offers so many special things: beef tongue, ground blood sausage wrapped in pastry, a couple of preparations of salt cod, flash-fried shrimp. There are trotters with tripe—honeycombed, fetid, strictly for the adventurous. <em>Txipiron</em>, or “squid ribbons,” taste more like pasta than like seafood, and are as delicate as tendrils of Spanish moss, for which, blessedly, there is no Basque equivalent.

His dishes, likewise, are small, as are the kitchen (two hot plates, two steam cookers) and the restaurant itself, which suggests the experience of dining in a well-appointed subway car. Claustrophobes should be warned that the single rest room is only slightly wider than a pair of broad shoulders, and you’ll have to jostle the cooks to reach it. Recently, a young woman squeezing past her seatmates was overheard muttering the obvious: “This is a restaurant for skinny people.”</p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">Mehta’s less-is-more approach (when not manning the hot plates, the chef hosts, waits, and buses the four communal tables) feels au courant, given the economic climate, but the restaurant’s aesthetic—and its name—conjures a scrappier, pre-Giuliani East Village. The chairs don’t match, foreign newspapers serve as placemats, and notes scrawled on masking tape adorn the walls. The food, on the other hand, is decidedly gentrified. Mehta, formerly of Jean Georges, cooks mostly according to Ayurvedic principles of balance, and each of his dishes is delivered with a brief soliloquy justifying its components. A delectable chestnut-bread starter, you are informed, has figs for sweetness, olives for saltiness, and goat cheese for creaminess; the chestnuts add “something earthy.” Pork dumplings come with tomato-chili sauce (sweet/spicy), grapefruit confit (sour), and fried chickpea noodles (crunchy). The menu’s standout is the Graffiti burger—two tiny, kebab-spiced patties that ought to rank among the city’s best, in spite of their size; chipotle mayo perfectly complements the fragrant beef and cold, crisp romaine. By contrast, the only discernible balance in a plate of chili shrimp is that between rubbery and scalding, and a dessert of warm truffled strawberries topped with black-pepper ice cream seems more concerned with decadence than with flavor.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">At the end of the meal, checks arrive inside envelopes graffitied by prior guests, palimpsests of dinners past. “I’m looking for a thoroughbred,” reads one message. “Must be: fast, appreciate poetry, sensitive, susceptible to fits of art appreciation, willing to move to Canada, can’t make me cook meat products.” Such retro bohemianism fades on the flip side: “Tristate Auto Mall has good deals on the Lexus ES350.” In the harsh light of recession, it might be the most passé note of the evening.

The restaurant’s lines are both modern and rustic—sleek teardrop light fixtures appeal to the urbanite, alder-wood branches in the window to the ruralist. The bar area is done in dark wood, pussy willows fill a great vase, and waitstaff wear plaid shirts. The over-all effect is that of a highly sanitized farmhouse, and yet, for all the contrivance, the place comes by it honestly: the chef, Brian Bistrong, once worked on a farm in New Jersey; a painting of his pastoral home in Connecticut hangs on a wall. Still, the city can’t help but intrude: on a recent evening, the dim room was pierced by the strobe of a police car’s lights outside. “This is a busy corner,” the bartender said. “They pull someone over every night.” </p><p data-wc="232" word_count="232">Bistrong, who most recently was the chef at the Harrison, concentrates on simple, hearty fare: a thick sirloin steak, a nicely roasted chicken (birthplace: Pennsylvania). Above all, there’s an attitude of respect—for the diner, for the cooks, for the ingredients. “I believe in saying hello and goodbye,” Bistrong once told the <em>Times</em>. “It shows you care, not just about being in the kitchen, but about the people you’re working with.” Unfortunately, sometimes respect can feel a lot like restraint. The duck breast, for instance, was perfectly cooked, succulent without being indulgently fatty, and surrounded by shredded Brussels sprouts. You’d be hard pressed, though, to remember the dish the next day. A rack of pork was notable for its sheer size, but there was little to distinguish it from any other mammoth piece of pig. Occasionally, a dish will break out, in one direction or another. The other night, the crab salad achieved the dubious distinction, thanks to a passion-fruit sauce, of cloying, lingering sweetness. The cod, on the other hand, was accompanied beautifully by a vivid onion-bonito broth and bright-green bok choy. Bistrong seems to approach his restaurant with a farmer’s self-effacing competence; but, for the price, and with a chef who has proved his mettle elsewhere, you want a little more big-city braggadocio.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/26/dirt-candy	Dirt Candy	430 E. 9th St. 	37.802293	-122.2769407	212-228-7732	2009/01/26	<p data-wc="86" word_count="86">The new vegetarian restaurant Dirt Candy (not to be confused with the X-rated movie “Dirty Candy”) deserves a better name. According to the owner and chef, Amanda Cohen, vegetables are like candy from the dirt. Maybe, but there is nothing earthy about her nine-table East Village restaurant. The translucent white tabletops, the glass-panelled walls, the greenish lighting, and, most of all, the food evoke some utopian future where the people have renounced not just meat but also soil, in favor of brightly colored, hydroponically grown produce. </p><p data-wc="197" word_count="197">Cohen is not a vegetarian (she eats seafood), but she is vegetable-mad. She has a problem with most vegetarian restaurants, which she says have a politicized, uncreative approach. She likes cream and butter and deep-frying, and is big on drizzling and tall garnishes. Many of her dishes are so earnest in their embrace of a single ingredient that you find yourself stopping to really think about that vegetable, as if for the first time. This is true of the portobello mousse, a dense, comforting cube topped with a pile of grilled mushroom slices. But if the candy-colored carrot risotto reminds you just how sweet and rich carrots can be, it can be exhausting for the same reason. Some of the other dishes suffer from the opposite problem. A pappardelle with cauliflower is unduly complicated by the addition of raisins and dehydrated-pine-nut wafers, which taste no better than they sound. The wine selections are strange—although thankfully cheap—with stranger descriptions. (According to the wine list, an Orzada from Chile is “super juicy” with “an absurdly spicy finish,” while on the restaurant’s blog, it’s “what a Viking ship would taste like if you could drink it.”)</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">In another goof, Cohen won the enmity of various online vegetarians when she called some of her clientele “weirdos” in an interview last month. (As she explained later to the Web site Gothamist, the restaurant was getting more than its share of “people with allergies and people who have their funny diet things like ‘Oh, I’m only eating white food today!’ “ and “‘I’m on a liquid diet. . . . Can you blend it for me?’ “) But the other night, at least, a mixed crowd of vegetarians and nonvegetarians seemed content. The guy at the next table, who was wearing a ski hat with a PETA logo, grew briefly critical (“It’s not really huge portions,” he said), but soon enough returned to his conversation, which concerned an acquaintance named Antler. He paused, and corrected himself: “No, not Antler, Elka.” (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $16-$18.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/19/flex-mussels	Flex Mussels	174 E. 82nd St. 	40.6382303	-73.9137569	212-717-7772	2009/01/19	<p data-wc="163" word_count="163">On the shellfish-as-grub scale, the mussel is neither as distinguished as the lobster nor as misunderstood as the sea urchin. It is loved by the Old World and neglected by the New—a Belgian’s <em>moules et frites</em> is an American’s burger and fries, and our chefs began to pay heed only after clams became scarce. Late last year, the restaurateur Bobby Shapiro débuted, on the Upper East Side, a version of a sea-weathered mussel shack that charmed his family while they were vacationing on the South Shore of Prince Edward Island. The name, though reminiscent of a Tarzan boast, is apt: Flex Mussels forgoes European and American tradition and puts the mussel on steroids. Amid oil paintings of life on P.E.I., little metal sand pails as bread baskets and light fixtures, and, curiously, a dozen security cameras, Shapiro offers pounds of P.E.I. mussels steamed twenty-three different ways—a tour of the world’s herbs and spices.</p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">“What country do you feel like visiting?” a server asked the other night. Nearly all stops are postcard-worthy, but some are more adventurous than others: the Dubliner combines Guinness, toasted walnuts, and caramelized onions; the Bombay employs curry, mango, and garlic; and the Spaniard uses chorizo, olives, tomato sauce, and red wine. In an impromptu voyage to Asia, the Peking (duck, ginger, rice wine) narrowly surpassed the Thai (curry-coconut broth, lemongrass, coriander). Kiddie forks help you pluck mussel from shell, but you quickly learn that the bang is in the broth, and it’s best to roll up your sleeves and apply the scoop-and-slurp. (There are some half dozen non-mussel items—lobster roll, seafood stew, steak frites—all in distinctly secondary roles.)</p><p data-wc="171" word_count="171">The main attraction at Flex Mussels, though, is a P.E.I. native named John Bil, whom Shapiro brought down to help him open up shop. Bil, who mixes drinks and commands the dining room with both a surfer’s insouciance and a shipbuilder’s precision, is a three-time oyster-shucking champion—“You know how you’ve got dog walkers here?” he asked recently. “Well, we’ve got oyster shuckers up there”—and he and his beach buddies like to steam a batch of mussels, freeze them in seawater, and, when drunk, thaw them and eat them like popcorn. Over a couple of bottles of Sauvignon Blanc in a room that smells more like the Atlantic Ocean than Coney Island does, Bil teaches you to eat them that way, too. He resolves moments of confusion without pretense or condescendence. Is a cooked but still closed mussel okay to eat? “Open it. If it looks wrong, don’t eat it.” It didn’t, and he did.

At the Swiss bistro Café Select, in Nolita, the latest venture of the restaurateur Serge Becker—a partner at La Esquina, the taco stand/café/secret subterranean tequila den across the street—there is an unmistakable air of European metropolitanism. The space is decked out with wooden and black leather banquettes, red and black Formica café tables, and a marble bar with a kiosk selling Swiss snacks, like Shorley apple soda and <em>Basler Läckerli </em>biscuits. Broad windows and the substantial Rolex clock hanging in the middle of the room lend to the appealing <em>à la gare</em> feel during the day; the lights dim to an amber glow at night, abetted by a carefully curated, eclectic playlist (creditable to the co-owners, the Swiss d.j.s Oliver Stumm and Dominique Clausen).</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">The menu is rife with unrecognizable Swiss German appellations for homey Swiss soul foods, like <em>Chäschüechile</em> (a delectable Emmentaler-Gruyère-Swiss-cheese tart with a caramelized crust) and <em>Flädli</em> soup, a fortifying beef consommé garnished with savory strips of buckwheat crêpe, which satisfies a salt craving while restoring one’s health. An appetizer of poached marrow, served in the bone, to be scooped and slathered on garlic toast and sprinkled with roasted-scallion-infused salt, melts like butter. The entrées include faithful renditions: Zurich veal, pounded and smothered in creamy mushroom sauce, served with crunchy-soft spätzle; a fine veal brat, with <em>Rösti</em>, a crispy potato cake as big as a salad plate. Entrecôte “Café Select,” a center-cut strip steak, rivals any bar steak in the city; beef “Silvia” does the same for arugula-and-steak salad.</p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">With bonuses like the <em>Ski Wasser</em>, a fizzy elderflower-and-vodka-infused lemonade, and a festive Sunday-night fondue special, Café Select offers a respite in a neighborhood surprisingly limited in bistro standbys (the inevitable hour-plus-long wait at Balthazar excludes it from consideration). It may not be the Jungfraujoch, but it does make for a lovely morning: a <em>Laugen</em> croissant and a latte at the bar, sunlight streaming through the front windows, watching time tick away—because, really, where do you have to be?

Farther back, banquettes are printed with the signature of Washington Irving (who gave his name to Irving Place) and with scraps of text from his work. The effect, alas, looks tacky—more suburbs than Sleepy Hollow. </p><p data-wc="240" word_count="240">Irving Mill recently acquired a new chef—Ryan Skeen, an up-and-comer whose reputation rests on his apparent obsession with pork in its many forms, expressed in such dishes as pig’s-ear salad and a thing called pork toast, mashed-up pork jowls breaded and deep-fried—a kind of croquette. The good news is that pork toast probably has fewer carbohydrates than regular toast, but, in every other conceivable way, it surely has a claim to being New York’s most unhealthful dish. Pig’s ear, meanwhile, sprinkled over radicchio and escarole, looks like pork rind but behaves differently in the mouth: instead of a crunch, it has a dry, almost ceramic crack. Ears are not the most flavorful part of a pig, and Skeen quietly gussies up the salad with a good deal of bacon. He seems less secure when he can’t fall back on pork fat to tie a dish together. Appetizers of marinated raw fish (fluke or hamachi) lack distinctiveness; on a recent visit, a main course of sturgeon had nothing to say to the puréed beets that accompanied it. Still, Skeen achieves some lovely subtleties. The boudin blanc on the charcuterie platter has a tantalizing hint of citrus. Gnocchi with rock shrimp and Meyer lemon have a similarly acidic note, and are miraculously soft and light, while the shrimp, cooked not a second too long, retain a slight translucence and burst when you bite into them.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">Generally, the restaurant seems unsure whether it’s a lively after-work place (with a memorable burger enhanced with fatback and beef cheeks) or a more refined enclave where people might order fluke <em>crudo</em>. The space is cavernous, and the music in the bar is loud, but everything else is countrified in the manner of an overdone Hudson Valley bed-and-breakfast—pine sideboards, gourds, farming implements, landscape paintings, and photographs of stern-looking Victorians. Enormous wheel-shaped chandeliers hang from the rafters, bringing Errol Flynn irresistibly to mind. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner and Sundays for brunch and dinner.

Even the speakers, high on the wall, are teeny, though the music—Dave Matthews Band, Bob Marley—comes out big (often too big; one evening, Dobias and Schulster had a vigorous debate about whether when the volume was just right for the kitchen it might be too loud for the dining room). The number of diners, too, is often on the low side, particularly when you look down the street to the ever-popular Prune, where, on a recent rainy Sunday morning, a crowd huddled under its awning for an hour or more.</p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">It’s not an easy thing to take on the territory of such an established spot, particularly when you are dealing in much the same stock: simple American, with emphasis on the whole animal. But, to Dobias’s credit, the biggest thing about the place is its flavors. (Closely followed by its portions.) A liver-bacon-and-onion sandwich, listed as an appetizer, was luscious and comforting, and large enough for a hearty meal, as was the Beets &amp; Butt, in which the butt (pork, beautifully braised) easily outweighed the beets, and a dollop of marrow butter gave it all a rich sheen. Dishes can be both satisfying and discomfiting: the stuffed rice ball, baseball-size, fried, and sunk in marinara sauce, was addictive, if reminiscent of a mozzarella stick. The sweet-potato gnocchi, with sautéed apples and a pert apple slaw, had the incongruous addition of a fried egg. The Manx Station beef was nicely seasoned but needlessly topped with a tangle of tortilla strips.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">Aspirations, unfortunately, can’t guarantee success, and it seems doubtful that JoeDoe—with somewhat dutiful renditions of French toast and omelettes, and a disappointing chilaquiles—will pose any significant challenge to the Prune brunch juggernaut. But the restaurant’s intimacy means that a table’s verdict on their meal can be easily overheard. After dinner the other night, it was a little sentence and a big compliment: “That was fantastic.” (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

The problem is not Bouley’s ambition—any neighborhood is lucky to have an infusion of capital, and charcuterie, in these lean days—but, rather, that he seems to be rejiggering his holdings with greater haste than heed. A nine o’clock reservation might mean a ten o’clock seating. The bar check still says Danube. It’s Dubai on Duane Street.</p><p data-wc="295" word_count="295">Secession went up fast: barely two weeks after Gael Greene chronicled bickering between Bouley and the Tuscan chef Cesare Casella, with whom Bouley collaborated on Italian dishes (“Fuck you if you want to be French!” went an argument about lemon in the calamari), the place was open for business. (The calamari, for the record, is prepared with “ocean broth”: lemon, clam juice, onion, garlic, and herbs.) It’s a glorious rehab, preserving the plush intimacy of Danube—Klimt-style canvases, pendant lamps, scarlet lacquer, gold and teal accents—but not the heavy drapes. The de-stuffification is an achievement in itself: a room so beautiful deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. As for the menu, a narrower focus would have helped. The one Bouley finally settled on has eighty items—including geoduck clams, terrines, kebabs, baby goat, coconut shrimp, and a watery spaghetti carbonara. Variety alone is not a cause for complaint, but Bouley’s execution is all over the place: a salad of gizzards and red-wine-poached egg is a musky pleasure, while the one with foie gras and Jerez dressing is overly citrusy and almost oxymoronically bland. Same with the steaks: there’s a nice piney kick to the steak tartare, while the skirt steak—the dish you want to depend on—is overcooked and stringy. The Wiener schnitzel barely seems fried, as if whoever prepared it was scared it would come out greasy (there are flashes of its former glory in the accompanying lingonberry chutney, in which you can make out the individual berries, like a tapioca). Desserts are rickety—a <em>vacherin</em> with the texture of Play-Doh, a freezer-burned strawberry parfait. Fortunately, Bouley doesn’t shy from improvements. Fix her up, chef.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/08/char-no-4	Char No. 4	196 Smith St., Brooklyn 	40.68507455	-73.9917683035494	718-643-2106	2008/12/08	<p data-wc="181" word_count="181">Char No. 4, in Cobble Hill, belongs to the lately fashionable Southern genus. Witness the pervasive campfire scent from the basement smoker, the Texan chef (Matt Greco), and the service—as unhurried and welcoming as a drawl. But taxonomists may argue whether the place constitutes a restaurant, or merely a sophisticated bourbon showcase that happens to serve food. Hundreds of illuminated bottles of whiskey (mostly bourbon) reach to the ceiling behind the bar, and light fixtures in the shape of bourbon barrels cast a warm whiskey glow. The name itself—Char No. 4—refers to the highest degree of charring such barrels receive before the aging process. As might be expected, the cocktails are handled with care: the Homerun, if not quite the triumph its name implies, is refreshingly mature for a drink mixed with pineapple juice, and the addition of bourbon to a Bloody Mary affords a pleasant brown-sugar note. The food is not an afterthought, exactly, but if you happen to neglect your dinner plans after a third pour of Pappy Van Winkle, no one will pay it too much mind.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">If you do make it to a booth, you’ll find that the taxonomical conundrums extend to the menu. The eggs Benedict could pass for biscuits and gravy; the clam chowder is as texturally homogeneous as a bisque; the dandelion greens cooked with applesauce wind up tasting like pie. The shrimp and grits, prettily presented, are overwhelmed by a pungent scallion garnish. Yet there are some notable successes. Pair the house-cured bacon—as thick as a wallet—with the cornflake-crusted oysters and you might develop a new respect for breakfast foods. Honey-roasted chicken becomes exquisitely tender in the smoker. Perhaps most satisfying of all is a dish of butter-pecan ice cream drenched in—what else?—bourbon. The simple distillation of elemental flavors (sweet, salty, bitter) is the apotheosis of honest Southern eating. </p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Even so, if you find yourself sharing a booth with a Waffle House enthusiast, you may confront the inevitable question: “Is this really better than what you’d get in a diner?” Maybe not, but does it need to be? On a recent afternoon, the Chicago chef Grant Achatz, finishing brunch at a neighboring table, shrugged and smiled when asked for his informed opinion. “It was good,” he said. When it comes to comfort food, sometimes good is good enough. (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $14-$22.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

A few months ago, the celebrity chef Todd English brought to the neighborhood Libertine, an upper-class take on this working-class trademark. Lest the name fail to convey adequate profligacy, English established his restaurant on Gold Street, in a hotel called Gild Hall, and he christened a dining-room nook the C.E.O.’s Table. Out front, guests are greeted by depictions of a griffin, the mythological eagle-lion hybrid charged with guarding Scythia’s gold. English (surname aside, he’s a Georgia boy) revels in theatrics—a self-professed hair-gel junkie, he once made <em>People</em>’<em>s</em> “Fifty Most Beautiful” list—and a few months ago he could be excused for thinking that all this was a marvellous idea. But what happens when there isn’t any gold to guard?</p><p data-wc="237" word_count="237">Libertine can be a lonely place. The other night, a table of three was the rare bird among a covey of lone diners—reading, texting, staring out rain-soaked windows. Lucky, then, that pub food is fundamentally comfort food. Animal flesh abounds. In an otherwise excellent butternut-squash bisque, sweetbreads, tossed in like oyster crackers, risk filling you up prematurely. Ditto for the rest of the starters: mini, but not small, lobster rolls; Welsh rabbit beneath a mound of stout-steamed mussels; sliders, with fried oyster, mashed potato, and beef carpaccio stacked up like stones in a Gloucestershire cairn. Among the entrées, the size of the lamb potpie—whopping—only accentuates the fact that, even with a generous dash of harissa, the dish is a bland bowl of meat. The duck, beribboned with fat, arrives atop a curious mash of root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, parsnips) and beside a single stranded banger. Odds are you’ll be flagging by meal’s end, but no reputable libertine forgoes dessert. The excess of the “Cookies, Cakes, n’ Pies”—a single item that consists of fried apple pie, a butter-toffee-macadamia cookie, a caramel cupcake, a white-chocolate-covered pretzel, a pecan-chocolate-chip cookie, chocolate-pudding pie, and homemade ice cream—rivals that of the check. As a character in Amis’s novel puts it, “I tell you, man, you are out for a whole lot of money.” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $17-$27.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Convivio, at the heart of it, replicates its screwy feng shui. If you walk in and feel confused—by the cramped, half-hidden bar, by the fact that it’s no longer L’Impero, by the narrow path to the trio of steely hostesses who may acknowledge your reservation but who, after an hour, fail to honor it (actual remark, in response to a fifth how-does-it-look prompt: “I thought I’d seated you already”)—you may think that you are in a restaurant-anxiety dream: mouths wide shut. But no. Convivio, once you’re at a table, in a nifty swivel chair, and savoring a repentant round of hors d’ouevres (called <em>sfizi</em> here), is real, and dreamy, in the best sense of the word. An attentive but laid-back waitress who looks a bit like Jennifer Connelly dispenses unassailable recommendations, and before long you are eating exotic animal parts and exquisite pastas that live up to all the avid things your dinner companions have heard about them, and about their maker, the chef Michael White. </p><p data-wc="188" word_count="188">As usual, the application of the delicate to the brutish elevates the experience of dining on ultra-lipids. For example, the pickled watermelon rind and crunchy fennel seeds that come with the <em>testa</em>, a pig’s-head terrine (the inevitable remark: “That’s good head”), and the pickled onions and thin slices of hard-boiled egg that come with the lingua, a rosary of veal tongues. (A minority opinion: “It needs more acid.”) The pastas, which are homemade, are distinct and astonishing. Taste aside, the textural refinement of the saffron gnocchetti, with flecks of crab and sea urchin, and of the tortelli—filled but not stuffed with ricotta and <em>guanciale</em> and floating in a Pecorino sauce—represent the latest and highest repudiation of the old bachelor trick of throwing the spaghetti at the wall to see if it’s cooked. There’s a fine array of fish and beast, but in Tudor City, apparently, starch is king. The popular side dish of roasted potatoes is like a daydream about donuts, with Pecorino shavings in place of powdered sugar. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/17/allegretti	Allegretti	46 W. 22nd St. 	40.6640087894737	-74.1208956842105	212-206-0555	2008/11/17	<p data-wc="85" word_count="85">On a forgettable block in the Flatiron district, chef Alain Allegretti, a native of Provence who has worked at Alain Ducasse’s three-Michelin-star restaurant Le Louis XV, in Monte Carlo, and more recently at Le Cirque and Atelier, has bravely ventured into that riskiest of territory: the namesake haute-cuisine establishment. More famous people (including Ducasse himself) have failed at such an enterprise, but perhaps being lesser known could be advantageous: if you’ve never heard of the chef, how do you know what to expect? </p><p data-wc="198" word_count="198">The décor provides an inauspicious first impression. Near the entrance, an oversized leather sofa is flanked by a cluster of blue cube-shaped ottomans, kind of like MercBar circa 1997; the bar itself appears to be constructed of chocolate-veneer particleboard. The dining room, with its cream-colored walls dotted with gold-and-glass Colonial hurricane sconces and blue-and-white sea-life prints, has the air of a mid-priced hotel chain in Ocean City. (Perhaps the wood-burning oven in the corner, when it’s put into use, will make things cozier.) The menu—starting with the prices—has its own ambition: a delicate <em>rouget</em> appetizer prepared with <em>feuille de brick</em> had exquisite leaves of parsley, layered with paper-thin batter, scattered atop the fillet’s crispy, rose-flecked skin. The succulent braised short ribs, accompanied by a silver gravy boat filled with a deeply gratifying red-wine jus that probably takes thirty-five hours to make, was an unqualified success. Other dishes, though, faltered in their unnecessarily complicated execution. A hearty niçois ravioli contained rich, delicious oxtail, but the accompanying Swiss chard was tiresomely vegetal; the chestnut cappelletti was filled with an indistinct mash, but the burnished duck ragout underneath, infused with sweet onion and mushroom, was heavenly. </p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">The evening ended well, with desserts like lavender-honey crème brûlée and a gooey chocolate fondant with ricotta-almond gelato. But there were hints that Allegretti might not be quite ready for star billing. An otherwise gracious waiter described what went into the wild-mushroom <em>trifolati</em> by saying, “You know, seasonal mushrooms”; when probed for specifics about the cheese plate: “Oh, there are all different types of cheeses, from all different countries.” (Open Monday-Friday for lunch and Monday-Saturday for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/10/yerba-buena	Yerba Buena	23 Avenue A 	14.8442529	-91.5274657	212-529-2919	2008/11/10	<p data-wc="93" word_count="93">The term <em>yerba buena</em> refers to a number of different types of mint—exactly which depends on where in the Americas you are—and seems an apt name for a pan-Latin restaurant. Yerba Buena, which opened about four months ago in a slightly cursed East Village spot, unfussily pulls together a mix of cuisines—including Mexican (tacos), Peruvian (ceviche), and Cuban (a variation on the Cuban sandwich in pizza form)—in a room in which the dark wood, potted palms, and slatted blinds give the place a certain “Our Man in Havana” feel.</p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">The chef, Julian Medina, has a way of making individual tastes register, often by slightly undercooking vegetables, and his care for detail—the airy batter on the tilapia or the balance of flavors in the guacamole—can have a transformative effect on familiar dishes. Salt is a keynote, often thanks to the use of <em>chicharrón </em>(deep-fried pork rind). This is first encountered in the <em>picadas</em>, a paper cone full of pork scraps, chorizo, fried plantain, and miniature croquettes. But the porcine climax of the evening is the <em>lechón</em>, or suckling pig. The pork, succulent and pulled, has the fibrous texture of prosciutto or Peking duck. If the kitchen at Yerba Buena is a striking success, the bar is even more so. Familiar drinks, like the mojito, acquire a new botanical intensity, and the barman, Artemio Vasquez, has a number of creations that, unlike most specialty cocktails, deserve to be more widely known. The Desert Rose, made with rose-infused gin and prickly-pear juice and graced with a single floating petal, mixes dewlike purity with a twist of tartness. The Poquito Picante is a pale-green blend of gin, cilantro, and cucumber, garnished with a dried jalapeño, so that the placid initial taste contains within it a delayed crescendo of bite. </p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">There’s a lot to be said for eating at the bar, because the bar staff’s devotion to their art manifests itself in a kind of bibulous camaraderie, as they demonstrate cocktail-shake actions to each other; taste tequilas, mescals, and Dark-and-Stormys; and sometimes offer them to anyone who shows interest. As he passed each powerful potion around on a recent evening, Vasquez invariably justified it as being “good for the throat.” Indeed, infectious conviviality suffuses the entire place. When a birthday occurs (one an hour seems to be the average), the honoree has to blow out a sparkler rather than a candle, and the entire restaurant tends to join in the singing.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/03/matsugen	Matsugen	241 Church St., at Leonard St. 	null	null	null	2008/11/03	<p data-wc="156" word_count="156">The front of the house at Matsugen belongs to Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the Asian-inspired French chef whose restaurants include Spice Market, Perry Street, and the extraordinary Jean-Georges. Matsugen used to be 66, Vongerichten’s tribute to the Chinese kitchen. But the Chinese tiger did not roar on Church Street. Gone are the red calligraphed pennants hanging from the ceiling, although a fish tank (and a single moray eel) remains, along with—in what is perhaps a final nod to the Chairman—a long, often lonely communal bar. The room is chic, austere, and ultimately a bore; the staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and almost uncomfortably obeisant. The furniture suggests an office (a really nice one), and the kindly jitteriness of the waiters (they are big on speed-clearing) may make one less consumed by the food than by the sense that the bankers and traders a few blocks down might not be the only ones whose job security is uncertain.</p><p data-wc="303" word_count="303">The back of the house belongs to Masa, Taka, and Yoshi Matsushita, three brothers from Tokyo who own soba restaurants in Hawaii and Japan. Soba is a kind of thin noodle made of buckwheat flour, served hot or cold. In Japan, it’s eaten on New Year’s Eve (<em>toshikoshi soba</em>, or “year-crossing noodles”), and given to new neighbors as a gesture of good will (<em>hikkoshi soba</em>, “moving-in noodles”). Since Matsugen opened, in June, it has provoked wildly varying assessments. Vongerichten has chalked the most negative one up to the ignorance of a soba rube, writing on his blog, in response to a pan by Adam Platt, in <em>New York</em>, “It seems he may have misunderstood the concept behind Matsugen—it’s commitment to pure, authentic Japanese cooking.” But Matsugen can be a letdown for those who appreciate, and even crave, the stark flavors of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant’s signature appetizer, a “bakudan” of uni, salmon, and baby scallops, topped with nori and a poached quail egg, is gorgeously arrayed in an earthenware bowl, but the Tokyo clam chowder with soy milk—Vongerichten says it’s one of his favorite dishes—is a dull muddle of wheat gluten and chewy clams. The <em>omakase</em> menu, an opportunity for exuberance, was mirthless: satisfying, but safe, miso-glazed salmon; a salad of field greens and desiccated pork loin; wan mushrooms coated in a truly awful gritty batter. Some of Matsugen’s dishes, like the good but not great duck soba, the extra broth of which a diner is encouraged to drink, may be enriched by an understanding of their form. But, like haikus, some soba houses are better than others, and it doesn’t take a scholar to figure out that this one is missing some beats. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/27/apiary	Apiary	60 Third Ave. 	51.5810557	-0.0177364	212-254-0888	2008/10/27	<p data-wc="189" word_count="189">In the East Village, a neighborhood known for its all-you-can-eat sushi and alarming preponderance of Irish sports bars, post-collegiate insouciance permeates the dining scene. Even the area’s more ambitious restaurants, which are invariably of the David Chang variety, adopt a resolute informality: bar stools, communal tables, open kitchens. Apiary affects no such fratty precociousness. Dimly lit and darkly appointed, it is the sort of place grownups from Gramercy might go if they venture too far down Third Avenue. And if grownups are generally understood to be people who have not filled their entire apartments with IKEA, Apiary is all the more apropos, because it is a restaurant that is really a furniture showcase. A franchise of Ligne Roset, the high-end French design house, created and owns the establishment, and the space is a study in a particularly Gallic strain of self-conscious sophistication. Instead of chandeliers, cylindrical silver ceiling fixtures are adorned with chandelier-shaped cutouts. Sleek, squat chairs are upholstered in deep wine-colored reds and purples. On the back wall, sprawled over a floor-to-ceiling mirror, is a gnarly-limbed “Day of the Triffids”-like lighting installation. (It’s called “Paranoid.”) </p><p data-wc="222" word_count="222">Meanwhile, Apiary’s menu covers some of the same ground as a Presidential debate—the American kitchen table with detours to the Middle East—with about as much resolution. The chef, Neil Manacle, worked for many years under Bobby Flay, who has publicly declared his aversion to lentils. The grill master’s apprentice displays a similar inclination for heft. A juicy Hudson Valley rabbit loin was treated with uncommon care: braised in a rich red-wine stock, swaddled in a thin slice of Serrano ham, then placed on a bed of pillowy pan-fried spaetzle. But other dishes were less convincing, including much of the Middle Eastern-influenced fare (fried hummus, apricot-and-mint-strewn couscous, calamari served with smoky relishes). A Moroccan spiced chicken had been rubbed with a host of seasonings—among them, cumin, coriander, paprika, and turmeric—but the only discernible flavor on the plate was cinnamon. There was a similarly cloying sweetness to the pork tenderloin, which arrived stranded in a sticky mustard-fig glaze. On the side were haricots verts dressed with shards of roasted hazelnuts, which brought to mind a Christmas cake. It didn’t help to be drinking one of the three signature sangrias—another culturally confused non sequitur, and further proof, if it were needed, that furniture companies aren’t meant to open restaurants.

The bar area, with its white and black marble tiles, arched pressed-tin ceiling, and large plate-glass windows, has the impersonal chic of a boutique hotel lobby. By contrast, the dining room looks almost unfinished, and the white, U-shaped banquette seems like a dare. White stucco walls and casement windows, set near the ceiling, with window boxes of flowers running underneath, produce a discombobulating effect: the outside inside. The other night, entertainment was provided by the plaid-shirt-and-jeans-clad manager, who occasionally stepped out and, through a glass-paned door, could be seen clambering up a ladder. </p><p data-wc="259" word_count="259">The chef, Tyler Kord, who most recently cooked at Perry St., has referred to his kitchen style as “casual badass.” That, presumably, means complicated dishes executed with an effortless air. It works. The menu is brief, suggesting careful curation, and even the bread, served with nutty, warm butter-bean purée and vinegary cucumbers, feels thoughtful. Kord loves his hot oil—the appetizer of cold roast pork is accompanied by a fried soft-boiled egg; the roast chicken rolled into its own skin and deep fried; the hanger steak topped with tiny circles of fried shallot. “It’s totally insane,” a waitress said one recent evening, describing the fried broccoli. Encased in a crunchy light tempura, the spears were nearly molten, their concentrated flavor boosted by a thick black-bean purée underneath. Kord has a flair for drama, too. The steak, along with a yellow-squash purée, came with fiery kimchi pierogies; the chicken was presented like a Rothko painting, with a stripe of deep-orange carrot purée, crisp green stalks of asparagus, and pale golden ovals of poultry. At times, the accumulation of fats gets overwhelming. “It’s a butter sponge,” a diner remarked of the brioche crouton perched alongside a heavily dressed green salad. Still, only the desserts seem to be trying too hard: a sesame devil’s-food cake was layered with both peanut butter and marshmallow and came with a miniature ginger egg cream, complete with tiny bendy straw. After so much sophistication, it felt less whimsical than childish. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner. Entrées $16-$20.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

For several years, this historic Brooklyn neighborhood has been enduring a growth spurt, and the locals’ eager acceptance of James, coupled with what is essentially a no-reservation policy, has led to hour-long waits. Since James has little room to spare, would-be diners are sometimes forced curbside, left to watch the action within. Once you’re seated, the place is dreamlike: amber beams from an outré Lucite chandelier are reflected in opposite mirrors, and James’s affectations—the grand palms at the end of the bar; the deliberately distressed wall; the copious votive candles—evoke Rick’s Café Américain, via Klimt’s “The Kiss.”</p><p data-wc="249" word_count="249">Too many servers conflate good with frequently ordered, but at James recently a diner’s request for guidance induced a waitress to recite nearly the whole menu—“seasonal-American . . . with ‘old-world European influences,’ “ as the Web site has it. She was right, beginning with a crab-cake starter that’s capped, in her words, with “super-fresh and really yummy micro-greens.” (The co-owners, Bryan Calvert, who cooks, and his wife, Deborah Williamson, who mingles, live above the restaurant, where they tend a six-hundred-square-foot herb garden.) Seared scallops float in a watercress purée studded with sweet roasted corn, while flaxen prawns are served with a sunchoke purée and garlic confit. An excellent fillet of brook trout is first sautéed, then covered with hazelnuts and chives, folded in half, tied with a string of budding chive, and balanced with a side of fennel and oranges—evidence of James’s vast but not vulgar aspirations. A tender loin of lamb, encrusted with pine nuts and rosemary, and served with a buttery three-bean stew, struck just the right notes of heavy and light. The desserts, though, especially the warm ricotta beignets, win out. On a recent evening, the finest compliment, aside from the empty plates and the vows to return, came from a couple who live just down the block. Thinking of their postprandial chores, one of the two leaned in to say, “We’ll never let our dog go pee on their planters.” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

Its food, a blend of Italian and Provençal influences, is handily exploited by this competitively priced restaurant. Although there are a few photographs evoking Nice’s café-society glory days and, outside, a Vespa (an obligatory talisman of Europeanness for New York restaurants), Nizza’s atmosphere seems closer to diner than to charming French boîte. The light-wood fittings and long bar are thoroughly neutral; food comes on familystyle oval dishes; and the music is on the loud side. </p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">The most interesting offerings are regional specialities, such as <em>tomaxelle</em>, a Ligurian dish of stuffed veal rolls, and <em>socca</em>, a flat, round cake made of chickpea flour and topped with sage, onion, and Pecorino cheese—crisp and glistening on the outside, gluey and mealy within—a hearty item that tastes more like sausage than bread. The dish is a bit of a mascot: at brunch, you can have it with eggs on top. The rest of the menu peps up the familiar with a dash of novelty. Bruschetta is topped with broccoli puréed to the consistency of pesto; an otherwise average chicken salad conceals a slice of duck salami. Not every dish comes off—a zucchini salad was over-oiled and confused as to whether it was meant to taste of raisins, mint, marjoram, or (hey) zucchini—but the standard of cooking is often equal to that of a much more ambitious restaurant. </p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">Down the block from Nizza, and, oddly, sharing the same address, is a restaurant called Marseille. How much Riviera can Ninth Avenue take? In fact, both restaurants are part of a group that started years ago with French Roast and gradually added establishments that gesture toward regional cuisines ranging from Lyonnais (L’Express) to Breton (Maison). Currently, there are a couple of storefronts between the two restaurants, but it’s surely only a matter of time until they are filled in with eateries called Saint-Tropez, Monaco, and Cap Ferrat.

If you could take the appealing things about it—beauty, taste, social energy—and leave behind the annoying ones—long waits, stupid prices, jerks—you might come up with something like I Sodi, the West Village restaurant run by Rita Sodi, who moved to New York from Florence last year, after decades working for Calvin Klein Jeans. Christopher Street is a “directional” choice, to use the industry euphemism, but the S. &amp; M. sidewalk scene only makes the place, once you’re inside, feel like more of a haven. Sodi, the platinum-spike-haired proprietress, is often at the bar, treating it like her kitchen table, and her casual air—one night, she and some friends were hacking away at a watermelon—is contagious. The young sommelier, Håkan Westergren, and Mark Dorsey, his wised-up sidekick, are smart, funny, and generous with the post-meal grappa. They’re also generous with those who have partaken too much of their generosity. One night, Dorsey offered a home remedy for hiccups: a lemon dunked in bitters, dipped in sugar. It worked.</p><p data-wc="206" word_count="206">The menu at I Sodi is small, rotating, and more than ably executed by the chef Michael Genardini, who has cooked at L’Impero and Alto. (Even so, he’s likely never had such a gorgeous kitchen. I Sodi, all pine and tiles, could be the setting for a fantasy Tuscan cooking school.) His lasagna is traditional but sophisticated, with a woodsy top layer that brings to mind chocolate or mushrooms more than boring old hamburger. Strong savory flavors also come through in the tortelli—piney sachets of parmigiano—and the <em>coniglio in padella</em>—fall-apart rabbit, simmered in white wine and garnished with whole black olives. <em>Galetto schiacciato</em>, a Cornish hen smooshed with a brick, halved, and splayed, resembles a Rorschach blot, though it’s hard to interpret it as anything but a good dinner. For dessert, an especially wise choice is the blackberry tart, which has an unexpected gingerbready kick. Order it, as long as Richard Johnson, a maître d’, hasn’t already snuck you spoonfuls of <em>stracciatella</em> gelato. By day, he’s a criminal attorney. If I Sodi is an example, he’d do just fine with a second career. (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for lunch and dinner. Entrées $19-$38.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/09/22/general-greene	General Greene	229 DeKalb Ave., at Clermont Ave. 	null	null	null	2008/09/22	<p data-wc="125" word_count="125">The General Greene is a restaurant of lowered expectations, in the best possible way. The walls are largely unadorned, most of the tables line up along a (not uncomfortable) wooden bench, the bar stools were once tractor seats. The owner—Nick Morgenstern, formerly of Gilt and Gramercy Tavern—had, until this week, opened up only half of the indoor seating, leaving the rear of the restaurant darkened. (“We wanted to take it incrementally,” the general manager explained.) The name derives from Nathanael Greene, a self-taught military man from Rhode Island, who commanded Fort Putnam, in what is now Fort Greene Park, during the Battle of Long Island; but it also plays on the notion of the general store, that neighborhood locus of gossip and goods. </p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">It’s clear that the General Greene has set out to become a staple in its own right, most obviously with its burger (concocted with the help of Ryan Skeen, late of Resto and his own acclaimed burger). It’s the size of a hockey puck—small in diameter, plump in the middle—but juicy. The flavor is dynamic enough to inspire debate—is there some pork in there, or lamb? Nope: it’s a hundred per cent Angus beef, from DeBragga, at a seventy-thirty ratio, making you forget (or at least forgive) the backyard-cookout accompaniment of potato chips. </p><p data-wc="223" word_count="223">The burger performs another function: it’s a familiar standby on a menu that relies on small plates, a great concept in theory (sharing, variety) but one that causes consternation, as small-plate menus are wont to do. (Which ones? How many?) While the choices at General Greene are nearly all satisfactory, some are outstanding, and the challenge is that the same dish, from night to night, can switch categories. A summer-squash salad, laced with pesto, earned raves one evening for its crunch and snap; another night, the flavors were still zippy but the texture was limp; an heirloom-tomato salad once came out as slices of fairly unprepossessing fruit, but a second visit turned up vivid specimens worthy of the name. Some dishes are hard to get wrong, though, and not for nothing do some of the staff’s T-shirts read, “Swinevore”: pig is a staple, showcased in the dirty rice; the candied bacon; peppery, meaty pork ribs; a creamy, custardy ham-and-Gruyère bread pudding. As befits a local spot, the waiters are friendly and engaging, but ask, ever so casually, for the secret to the chocolate-chip cookies, served warm and gooey, and you’ll find that even the most neighborly of restaurants won’t share everything. (Open Tuesdays through Fridays for dinner and Saturdays and Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $8-$13.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Square Meal is the restaurant next door, in the bottom floor of a town house. Yura is Yura Mohr, the baker and chef who opened the restaurant a year ago. As for the square meal—that is what you get here. The name is perfect, conveying as it does the affectation of no affectation. </p><p data-wc="213" word_count="213">The surroundings are on message: bare floors and walls, bright light, no music, dirty-blond wood, sprigs of herbs on each table, bar shelved with cookbooks rather than booze (you’ll need to bring your own, to round out your meal). The clientele can be square, too: bow ties, Belgian loafers, do-I-know-you once-overs. But the vibe, generally, is lower-key Upper East Side—genially conservative rather than garish or stuffy, more bookish than Botoxed—and so is the food, which is sophisticated but, by contemporary measure anyway, unadventurous. Although the menu changes with the seasons, Mohr’s regulars have more or less forbidden her to replace certain dishes, such as the Maryland crab cake, the slow-roasted chicken, and the seared scallops with oyster mushrooms. This insistence, typical of the neighborhood, is less exasperating here, because these renditions are very fine ennoblements of the country-club meal. The ingredients are fresh and distinct, the portions right, the presentation clear. The same goes for the short-timers: a recent spate of summer soups (strawberry for a while and then corn bisque) tasted as though they’d sprung from the ground. Such agility prevails from start to finish, from cheddar-rosemary biscuit to nectarine cobbler, and without much risk to the statin set—Yura doesn’t much care for red meat.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">Squareness has other advantages. It can serve as an antibody against hipness. The neighborhood, short on good eating, can hardly stand to see a dependable new restaurant turn into a reservation nightmare, like Sfoglia, a couple of blocks east. If Square Meal is a little boring, this is how everyone, from the back of the house to the front, seems to like it. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner.

The New French also replaces the old French of Le Gamin, the spot’s previous tenant. In any case, the New French isn’t French. The new French, as manifested by the New French, is new American. All of this was explained the other night, more or less, by a waiter whose T-shirt depicted the California state flag. He took care to add that, while forty remains the new thirty, the new black is harder than ever to pin down.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">After you’ve nailed the name, you can tackle the New French’s pleasingly straightforward menu, which, when coupled with the dining room’s agreeably understated atmosphere, imbues a patron with a kind of ready-made I-wanna-be-a-regular yen. (It helps, these days, that everyone lusts after the West Village.) The space, small, with a couple dozen tables and a quarter as many staff, can at times be a tad cozy, but its centerpiece, an orange-white-and-gold mural by the illustrator Maira Kalman, of trees and animals and men in porkpie hats, is elegant in its modesty. The bench out front seems to sum the place up. You may sit there, whether or not your evening plans include dinner, and not get the stink eye; the New French just wants to be your friend.</p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">The trick, as the chef Livio Velardo seems to see it, is to lay off the tricks. “This place is honest,” a diner pronounced recently, after he and his tablemates happily put away the chicken-liver crostini and the day’s pizza—with grilled onions, goat cheese, and roasted red peppers—and were halfway through a bottle of Pinot Bianco, because, well, the Pinot Blanc just wasn’t supposed to be on the menu. The table advanced to well-crafted entrées of roast chicken with bok choy and oyster mushrooms and roast lamb with sautéed tomatoes and runner beans. Velardo’s pho was deemed too gingery, but his pulled pork, braised with chili and beer, offered plenty of succor with its spice. The desserts were functional though forgettable: “The tart is tart,” the diner said, of an underwhelming lemon curd. Maybe a bit of imperfection is the new perfection.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/09/01/shalizar-and-ravagh	Shalizar and Ravagh	1420 Third Ave., at 80th St. 	null	null	null	2008/09/01	<p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Joining the Parthians (250 B.C.-226 A.D.), the Sassanians (224-651), and the Safavids (1501-1736) are two contemporary Persian dynasties: the Bayati (1990-present), which has built a mini-empire in 6-train territory, and the Tehrani (1999-present), whose fiefdom roughly follows the F line from midtown all the way to Long Island. Kaz Bayati—along with Parvez Eliaas, who is from Bangladesh and used to cook at Café Boulud—is the proprietor of the city’s most venerable Iranian restaurant, Persepolis. Two months ago, he and Eliaas opened a second, spiffier place, Shalizar, which has forty more seats, fancy cocktails, and the same dry kebabs. Their chief competitor is Masoud Tehrani, whose family owns three other Iranian restaurants in the area: grubbier, more traditional, and all called Ravagh (including one in Nassau County).</p><p data-wc="253" word_count="253">The proof is in the <em>polo</em>. Shalizar’s <em>albaloo</em>, the classic dish of saffron basmati rice and sweet and sour cherries, is a pleasant but indistinct mush. At Ravagh, meanwhile, the flavors of the fruit remain on the punchier side of stewed, bleeding into those of the rice only at the vivid edges—tie-dye you can eat. Shalizar sticks with standard china, but Ravagh plays to the eye with brightly colored crockery. The rice looks gorgeous on the platter, as if someone has sprinkled rose petals over a heap of marigolds. Ditto the grilled onion and tomato, traditional Persian accompaniments that are carefully chosen and attractively presented at Ravagh; at Shalizar, they’re subprime specimens dulled by overcooking. Shalizar’s <em>olivieh</em> (a potato salad with eggs, green peas, pickles, and chicken) is better balanced than Ravagh’s, which has too much mayonnaise, but the latter place racks up the majority of the taste-test victories. <em>Mast musir</em> (yogurt with shallots): Ravagh. <em>Khoresh fesenjan</em> (a sweet stew of chicken, walnuts, and pomegranate paste): Ravagh. Most crucially, Ravagh’s juicy, peppily seasoned<em> barg kebab</em>—as important a Persian contribution to society as an early postal system and carpets—relegates Shalizar’s to a gray second place. But dinner at Ravagh, which begins bracingly, with the delivery of mint sprigs and radish slices, dwindles to an anticlimactic close. Shalizar’s ends, with rose-extract ice cream, on a fragrant note. Long live them both. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Shalizar entrées $15-$29; Ravagh entrées $12-$23.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/25/scarpetta	Scarpetta	355 W. 14th St., at Ninth Ave. 	null	null	null	2008/08/25	<p data-wc="103" word_count="103">In a town full of whiz-kid chefs, Scott Conant is an anomaly; at thirty-seven, he cooks like an older man—wisely, taking his time, knowing exactly what he’s doing. Having established his mastery of Italian cuisine at L’Impero (where he pulled off the oxymoron of refined rustic) and Alto (where he veered into esoterica), Conant has now relocated, jettisoning the stuffy drapes-and-sconces trappings of his previous restaurants for Scarpetta, a streamlined space on the border of the meatpacking district. Think billionaire’s farmhouse: high rafters; a peaked, retractable roof; mirrors tilting from the walls, strapped in place with giant leather belts. </p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">The most telling design feature, however, is the rows of Edison bulbs, filaments exposed, suspended in glass-and-steel boxes. As a waiter will explain, Conant has decided to strip things down; the philosophy is “Nothing flashy.” It takes <em>cojones</em> (or, given Conant’s field of cuisine, <em>coglioni</em>) to serve as your signature dish something as banal as spaghetti with tomato sauce (and to charge twenty-four dollars for it), but Conant’s version of the Italian warhorse—perfected at L’Impero and reincarnated here—is a small marvel: earthy and sweet, a chiaroscuro of bright and dark notes, the tomatoes and basil achieving a kind of velvety symbiosis with the just-shy-of-tender pasta. The main courses are perhaps too straightforward, albeit cooked with thoughtfulness and nuance. By contrast, the pastas are nearly all wows: octopus is the unexpected star of a vigorous ragù; chickpeas, pancetta, and bitter greens vie for supremacy in a silky, buttery meld with cavatelli. (The lone misstep in this category is the ponderous duck-and-foie-gras ravioli, striped with a sticky-sweet Marsala reduction.) </p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">The crowd reflects the restaurant’s address: weeknights belong to tyro bankers in French-blue button-downs (male) and sweaters knotted around the shoulders (female), weekends to girls in tiny dresses with strategic cutouts and their jockish dates. But Scarpetta has little in common with the oversexed lounges and high-end culinary theme parks (Del Posto, Craftsteak, Morimoto) that dominate the neighborhood. If anything, the most theatrical aspect of the place—the stadium-like retractable ceiling—seems to provoke more anxiety than pride: one waiter confided that he’d had nightmares about sudden rainstorms. There’s something charmingly old-fashioned about the attitude here; the staff even volunteer that Conant is “a really nice guy.” (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/11/rhong-tiam	Rhong-Tiam	541 LaGuardia Pl. 	40.7287367041534	-73.9982648444211	212-477-0600	2008/08/11	<p data-wc="84" word_count="84">It’s easy to walk straight past this unassuming Thai eatery, which is set deep in the heart of the N.Y.U.-occupied Village and shares a commercial strip with a liquor store, a mailing center, and a Citibank. The co-owner, Andy Yang, and his partner’s family also own the Malaysian restaurant chain Penang; inside, Rhong-Tiam is almost oppressively generic. Ivy winds around a bannister. The tired-looking upholstery is striped in black-and-white. The tables wobble. The lighting is bright and almost antiseptic. </p><p data-wc="205" word_count="205">But then there are the idiosyncrasies: the pink Vespa that takes up most of the entryway (meaning there’s little room for waiting diners), the dashing ensemble of fedora and waistcoat worn by the host. In place of Penang’s insipid fare, there’s an extensive list of Thai dishes, some of which have enough heat to inspire comparisons to the incomparable Sripraphai, in Queens. These are each marked on the menu by a tiny chile pepper, but there really should be gradations. The spice of the pineapple <em>achat</em>, a piquant mix of pickled vegetables, tofu, and pineapple, isn’t anywhere close to that of the Pork on Fire, a delectable concoction that amply lives up to its name. Sautéed with lemongrass, Kaffir-lime leaves, basil, and bird’s-eye chiles, the pork tips are fiery enough to bring tears to your eyes (not least because it’s nearly impossible to avoid biting into a crispy chile). Yet the fire isn’t without flavor: even as the southern-style chicken, minced and reddened with curry, singes the tongue, hints of ginger and lime are equally discernible. A catfish-and-green-mango salad—served, McDLT-style, with the mango and fried catfish kept separate—is a wonder of zing, crunch, and cool.</p><p data-wc="145" word_count="145">There are areas in the menu that are best skipped over, or left to less adventurous dining companions. Drunken Noodle is a well-done classic, but both it and the capably seasoned black-pepper beef felt mandatory rather than inspired. “Thai nachos” turned out to be a heap of greasy shrimp chips the texture of Styrofoam, with a mild dipping sauce of coconut and minced shrimp and chicken. “The most interesting thing about this is the name,” one diner recently complained. Dessert, a generally unremarkable course at most Thai restaurants, might easily be overlooked, with its conventional offerings of mango sticky rice and green-tea ice cream. But there is also a wedge of pumpkin, filled with custard and surrounded by a delicately rendered sauce of sweet coconut. It looks almost too lovely to eat, but you’ll manage.

One evening, a hostess led a party past the main room and down a narrow hallway, which opened into the kitchen: a gantlet of sorts, lined with staff, all of whom rushed to wish the guests good evening. One didn’t quite know where to look, or how to respond. Then onward, to what looked like the library of a very tasteful gentleman—soft jazz, art tomes, dark wood. It felt advisable to keep one’s voice down, and perfectly fitting that Tom Wolfe, that chronicler of decadence, also dined at the restaurant that evening. (“I told him we were bringing back the necktie,” a similarly beknotted host said, as the impeccably elegant author passed through the entry.)</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">Even if, more commonly, one is seated in the main dining room—bordello-ish, with red plush banquettes and red drapery, but with an Arctic chill to the air—the element of subversion remains. Knives stand on edge; the plates veer slightly off center. And the chef, Ed Brown, seems to delight in preparing dishes in which appearance diverges from taste. An entrée of salmon, looking like a petal-pink-and-pale-green Lilly Pulitzer print, seemed utterly old-fashioned. There was the dill, the firm peas, the whole pearl onions; but the flavors of sea and land were remarkably precise. What looked incongruously like guacamole, accompanying the superb veal (along with veal cheek, pure delicious fat that melted on the tongue), turned out to be an asparagus purée; codfish, heaped with crispy shallots, tasted like French onion soup. </p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">Brown does the straightforward, too—a nicely cooked steak, scallops adrift in foam—and he’s particularly adept at drawing forth the seasonal. A chilled soup of fava beans and peas tasted like distilled spring, while a green-bean salad, pertly dressed with a cucumber vinaigrette, was almost too abundant for the plate. Thick spears of asparagus and fennel were draped with thinly sliced ham. “What’s not to like about a bacon salad?” a diner asked. An apricot-and-Bing-cherry crumble achieved a golden ratio of sweet topping to tart filling, handily trumping peanut-butter fritters and a geometric chocolate-and-hazelnut mille-feuille. Tricks are nice, but the fruits of the season win out. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $27-$39.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/07/28/adour	Adour	2 E. 55th St. 	40.624893	-73.9844009	212-710-2277	2008/07/28	<p data-wc="142" word_count="142">There are people, a dwindling lot, who are secure in their mortgages and to whom the spectre of five-dollar-a-gallon gas presents more a challenge than a threat. These people eat at Adour. The restaurant opened in the St. Regis several months ago, and it’s as posh and pricey as the eatery of a landmarked hotel necessitates. It also constitutes the away team in a much-hyped rematch: the toughest of restaurant towns versus the Frenchest of chefs, the Michelin-star-studded Alain Ducasse. (An earlier New York venture by Ducasse, who operates twenty-one restaurants, including one in the Eiffel Tower, closed in 2006; of that spot, with its handbag perches and splatter art, the less said the better.) Ducasse may be the underdog, but those in a sporting mood will judge his new joint by what shows up at the ballpark. Let the game commence.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Adour, as a recent diner put it, “feels like a jewelry box,” rectangular and pewter-colored, with floridly etched glass and burgundy banquettes. Waiters stand along the perimeter, as solemn as tennis ball boys, before dashing hither and thither to perform solicitous acts and utter hushed the-pleasure-is-all-mine-sirs and think-nothing-of-it-ma’ams. The food is exquisitely executed French: duck foie-gras terrine, striped bass in sauce <em>vin jaune</em>, chicken fillet <em>à l’unilatéral</em>. A delicately light zucchini ravioli, floating in foamy vegetable broth, is itself a jewel. One impressive entrée offers flavorful pig three ways: lean, tender pork tournedos, served with sides of pork belly and <em>boudin noir</em>. Adour’s pièce de résistance is a provocative dessert that combines, to sublime effect, vacherin with coconut, mango marmalade, and passion-fruit emulsion—so good it should be sold in takeout tubs.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">There is, though, the matter of drink. Ask the sommelier to assist with the seventy-five-page wine book and he will exhibit a Seussian exuberance: “Oh, there are so many places we could go!” But the fares to those places often exceed two hundred dollars. For nine thousand dollars, bring your own and keep it in a well-positioned locker engraved with your name. This is, as a waiter explained, with nose only slightly upturned, “a little commercial for yourself.” There is also the private tasting room, in which a cutting-edge, interactive wine book is splayed across a banquet table in a dazzle of photons. Set it to “Dark Side of the Moon,” and it’s better than the Trenton planetarium. “We kicked a taster out last night,” the waiter disclosed. “He had had, simply, too much to drink.” Away 1, Home 0.

The bartender began to offer a hint. “No!” she shrieked. “I’m trying to figure it out!” This tiny, wood-panelled bar attracts both wine snobs and wine neophytes, affectionate couples and solo sippers, and the bartenders convey their knowledge with enthusiasm rather than superiority. “That Chenin Blanc has a pedigree,” one shared the other evening. “It’s produced by one of the Chenin Blanc masters, who makes just a very small batch.” </p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">The woman swirled her wine vigorously, holding it to the light. “Is it a Pinot from Oregon?” There’s a small galley kitchen in the back (much of the prep work is done across the street, at Blue Ribbon Bakery), which produces simple, satisfying dishes: delicate, deconstructed lobster cocktail; curried-goat sliders with a red-pepper aioli that resembles melted Velveeta but tastes nothing like it. An egg-on-egg shooter—hard-boiled, topped with smoked trout and trout roe, with a slathering of crème fraîche—is dense and creamy; slabs of toast are topped with slivers of Manchego and soaked with honey. A recent special of braised pork belly, that unavoidable favorite of chefs, was treated with a slightly sweet sour-plum sauce, offset by a supremely spicy cabbage slaw. </p><p data-wc="163" word_count="163">The taster stuck her nose deep into the glass, noisily inhaled, and took another sip: “Could it be a Merlot from New York? I mean, I’m pretty sure it’s domestic.” The last bite of the evening might be the best: strawberry toast, drizzled with rich hot fudge and Mexican honey, sticky, sweet, acidic. And as pedigreed as the wine. “The chef at the Blue Ribbon on Sullivan—his family owns the hives that produce the honey,” the bartender noted. “We’re the only ones that import it. They’ve got several varietals—avocado blossom, autumnal blossom. They used to sell it to a German cosmetic company, until the owner tasted it one day and was like, ‘This is good!’” Speaking of varietals, do we have a final answer? The bartender broke the news: “It was a Cab Franc from Long Island.” The woman bounced on her seat and smiled broadly. “I was so close!” (Open daily for dinner.

But Ago, one of a chain of Italian trattorias that began in Hollywood and metastasized to South Beach, Las Vegas, and now Tribeca, might be the most cynical Californian export since Euro Disney. One is tempted to wonder, amid lurid cocktails and exhibitionist patrons, if the whole thing might not be Angelenos’ revenge ploy against the city that gave them Paris Hilton.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Ago offers a Blueberry Martini, which comes garnished with the dry, mottled lemon that seems to have appeared on the lip of every glass of Diet Coke served this decade. It isn’t fit for a Smurf. One night at the bar, a couple made out with an athleticism, and a sense of privacy, more often associated with sandy beaches on desert islands. Another time, a party waited to be seated, only to be dumped at a table two feet away from the bar stools on which they’d just killed twenty minutes. (The bill for drinks, of course, could not be transferred.) Besuited captains and black-vested waiters confer and preen and carry on behind a stone counter, while diners occupy, on the other side, a narrow lane of tables. The uneven allotment of space gives the feeling of a trespass, as do the chairs, which are wooden, uncomfortable, and heavy on finials and carved curlicues.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">Spa-ishly, there is a lot of seafood on Ago’s menu, but none of it—with the exception of <em>cacciucco toscano</em>, a tomato-based seafood soup that comes in a cute red crock and nicely plays sugar off of spice—is very good. The cuttlefish skewers are unmemorable, the spaghetti with clams is way too olive oily, and the seafood risotto is gluey and bland. A lamb chop, at thirty-eight dollars, has the heft of a snowflake. Dessert is probably the biggest rip-off: a warm Valrhona <em>tortino</em> that a waitress suggests, in almost dictatorial tones, is an arid dud; an apple tart with toasted almonds tastes like it’s been soaking in Amaretto.

There’s no tang of char in the air, no smoke pit seething in a back alley, no long-legged waitresses in denim cutoffs and cowboy boots. Those who come seeking barbecue—the eatery’s ostensible raison d’être—should know that, first and foremost, this is an Anita Lo restaurant, which means elegance, intelligence, and wit. Lo, who presides over the kitchen at the consistently great Annisa, earlier lent her expertise to fast food (Rickshaw Dumpling Bar), and here she seems to be striving for a middle ground. While the décor echoes Annisa’s (white walls, blond wood, swaddling leather booths), the decibel level is decidedly higher, the lighting bright and unmoody. The staff, despite their black uniforms, are almost disconcertingly enthusiastic (“I like your watch!”). One night, you might be served by a former contortionist, the next by a graduate student in clinical psychology. </p><p data-wc="209" word_count="209">When it comes to food, however, balancing the innovative and the crowd-pleasing is tricky. Early reports were not encouraging: diners, perhaps expecting sticky kalbi and rolls of paper towels, expressed dismay at the portion sizes, the prices, and the general culinary weirdness. But, to a Lo fan, the most exciting dishes here are precisely those which play havoc with tradition. Tuna ribs—a part of the fish commonly discarded—turn out to be talonlike bones with a thin, dissolvingly tender layer of meat, given subtle snap by yuzu and green chile. Unagi-and-scallion fritters simultaneously evoke the comfort of hush puppies and the delicacy of sushi. Best of all is the grass-fed Australian lamb, lean yet juicy, paired with wedges of cornstarch-thickened, garlic-infused fried milk that riff on creamy tofu, crisp on the outside and oozy on the inside. More conventional offerings are less successful, such as the pork “wings,” served with a ketchupy Asian sauce, and the tea-smoked duck, pulpy and uncomfortably reminiscent of a heart. And, while the short ribs are ably executed—the meat does indeed fall off the bone—the unusual accoutrements (a smear of spicy red-black sauce, a scattering of goji berries, a dollop of chestnut purée) fail to elevate them above the ordinary. </p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">At intervals, Lo emerges from the kitchen, head wrapped in a pink bandanna, to take the temperature of the room. The refinement of the cuisine doesn’t prevent a sense of free-for-all—couples dabble wantonly in each other’s entrées, groups squabble over prospective Vice-Presidential candidates while knocking back shiso juleps. It appears that the experiment is working: nobody seems troubled by a contradiction between dress-up and finger-licking good. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/23/bar-boulud	Bar Boulud	1900 Broadway, between 63rd and 64th Sts. 	null	null	null	2008/06/23	<p data-wc="194" word_count="194">An affectionate homage to the cuisine of Daniel Boulud’s native Lyons, Bar Boulud presents the earthy glories of French <em>terroir</em> in a setting reminiscent of a SoHo store or—with its long bar and swooping, swanlike decanters—a laboratory. The Lyons influence is apparent in the wine list, which focusses on the two adjacent regions (Burgundy to the north, the Rhône Valley to the south), and in the spectacular range of charcuterie. Few New York chefs venture farther into the latter than the predictable foie-gras terrine, but Boulud took the task seriously enough to bring a <em>charcutier</em>, Sylvain Gasdon, over from Paris. (Gasdon is a protégé of Gilles Verot, who comes from a line of <em>charcutiers</em> near Lyons and now operates two high-end stores in Paris.) “Is pâté really that hard to make?” a skeptical diner asked recently, but the restaurant’s diligence is repaid with a firm, rich head cheese, a <em>boudin blanc</em> (a sausage of pork and cream) that breaks apart in your mouth with feathery delicacy, and a torte of sweetbreads, foie gras, and morels sealed in pastry crust. Served in cross-section, it looks like edible marquetry. </p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Charcuterie aside, Boulud has made the canny decision to limit ambition for the sake of consistency. The menu takes in Lyonnaise <em>bouchon</em> specialties like coq au vin and chicken-liver salad and a roster of bistro favorites, like steak frites and <em>croque-monsieur</em>. More individual touches are rare but so, too, are missteps (though a pea soup lacked the necessary springlike sweetness and tasted mostly of its chicken-stock base). A simple dish of tarragon chicken was flavored and cooked with such remarkable evenness that the meat welcomed the knife almost like a fillet of fish.</p><p data-wc="162" word_count="162">As for the wine, the list teems with well-chosen, more or less affordable bottles, though prices extend well into four figures for anyone who’s game. There are fewer choices by the glass, though, and anyone who is not a committed oenophile may start to find the restaurant’s iconography of wine a little silly. One wall bears a series of framed wine stains, which looks as if Hermann Rorschach had taken to drink, and one end of the dining room is dominated by a ring-shaped table intended for wine tastings, though it currently serves as an ordinary, if awkward, communal table. A queasy sense that oenomania can be taken too far takes hold in the men’s bathroom, where one notices grainy black-and-white photographs of the smudged, drained glasses from a lunch that Boulud held for Robert Parker in 2002, which are hung directly above the urinals. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $23-$33.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

The staff seems perpetually harried; one night, the hostess couldn’t find a waiting party and exclaimed, when the impatient group approached to check on the status of its table, “You aren’t who I thought you were!” On another evening, at 7:30, the kitchen was out of the pappardelle and the lamb, two of the more acclaimed items on the menu. Even as the surrounding tables were vacated and left empty, the remaining diners were hustled along: as one was slowly nibbling at the last bites of the addictively creamy <em>gnudi</em>, her plate was snatched from underneath her fork. And at 9 <small>P</small>.<small>M</small>. the waiter was explaining, “Because of the late hour, we are out of the panna cotta and the Sicilian ice-cream sandwich.” Was this Manhattan or Boca Raton? </p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">The restaurant, which opened in February, is the third collaboration between Donatella Arpaia and Michael Psilakis, after Dona (which closed last year) and Anthos. Meant to evoke “a home where Donatella would gather friends and family for a long Sunday afternoon supper,” the narrow space is divided into three rooms: the “lounge” (white-washed brick, black accents), the “living room” (floral wallpaper), and the “library” (blond wood, bookshelves). The menu offers a personalized wine list created by Arpaia (“Wine I Drink When I Don’t Have to Pay the Check”: a 2003 Château-Pape Clément, $400) and casual, homey Southern Italian fare from Psilakis. There’s a strong whiff of maternal influence (“Wine I Learned from My Mother”: a 2004 Aglianico del Vulture, $75). </p><p data-wc="155" word_count="155">Psilakis’s menu largely succeeds: the pappardelle has a light, delectable coating of Bolognese sauce; the <em>polpettone</em>, hearty sage-infused meat loaf, is topped with a rosy crater of egg. Frying is occasionally used to good effect: salty baccalà, with a soft, slightly sweet interior, conceals an even better mild fried ricotta, and pickled French fries, regrettably now off the menu, were a pert combination of salty and sour. The fried rabbit, though, has heavy breading that all but obscures the gamy flesh it encases. And even when the Sicilian ice-cream sandwich was available, it fell short. By the time it reached the table, the gelato had melted and the brioche was too hard; only the table’s most dedicated sweet tooth persisted in spooning it up. It felt less like home and more like an overwhelmed restaurant. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, Saturdays for dinner, and Sundays for brunch and dinner.

The pretzels at Katja bear little resemblance to petrified pushcart versions; they’re not jawbreakers, in the Snyder’s mode, nor soggy, like Auntie Anne’s, with superfluous glucosey glop. Don’t expect mustard, either. Toasty little twisters, they come with pots of sweet <em>Liptauer</em>, seasoned with onions, chives, paprika, and caraway seeds. <em>Guten Appetit!</em></p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">Schrottner, along with a partner, Andrew Chase, opened the place in the fall, though a catering company that he owns, in midtown, “provides the bread every day that my family lives off.” Schrottner presides over the small, stylish dining room (lace curtains, pinecones, a panoramic poster <em>von der Schmittenhöhe</em>) most nights, decked in foresty woollens, as if he had just stepped out of Loden-Plankl. He conceived of Katja as “a home away from home for Austrians,” and named it after one of his three daughters. Hesitantly, he larded the menu with the staples of his native Graz (where Kepler was banished in 1600 for refusing to convert to Catholicism): speck, blood sausage, beef cheeks, spätzle. To his surprise, even the liver dishes—for instance, the wonderful, spreadable liverwurst with red-onion jam, a decadent peanut butter and jelly—have gone over<em> wunderbar</em>. “I don’t think there’s anything a New Yorker won’t eat,” Schrottner said.</p><p data-wc="147" word_count="147">Or drink, evidently. Spurred, perhaps, by the beer selection—Samichlaus, Stiegl, Gösser—or the staff’s perfect ceremonial pours, a swarm of transplanted Austrians, the other night, persuaded Schrottner to dust off the two-liter glass that he customarily stows, drunk-proof, on top of a high shelf. The vessel, a Hans-and-Franz-scaled monster, is known as “the boot” (Schrottner pronounces it “poot”), and draining it is indeed a hollow-legged endeavor. The house champ, Schrottner said, is an American who finished a bootful of Gösser in 1:27. The Austrians began belting out Austro-pop hits (“Wieder Hoam,” by Hubert von Goisern; Wolfgang Ambros’s “Du Verstehst Mi Ned”), and everyone sang along. For dessert, there was Linzer torte and buckwheat cake, with a pompadour of <em>schlag</em>. A request for Schrottner: next time, how about a choco-pretzel?

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/05/26/elettaria	Elettaria	33 W. 8th St. 	30.162381	-85.6606623333333	212-677-3833	2008/05/26	<p data-wc="145" word_count="145">Any restaurant formed by the remaining Presidential candidates (two parts Kenya and Kansas; one part Panama Canal Zone; a dash of Anywhere You Want) would surely resemble Elettaria, a kaleidoscope of cultures and histories. Elettaria’s chef, Akhtar Nawab, was born to Indian émigrés and grew up in Wisconsin and Kentucky. The parents of his partner, Noel Cruz, the front-of-the-house guy, are native Filipinos, and Cruz spent his younger years in Chicago, Florida, and Hawaii. While both men passed through such rarefied establishments as Gramercy Tavern and the French Culinary Institute, and their new venture’s name is erudite (<em>Elettaria:</em> from the Tamil; genus of cardamom, the world’s third most expensive spice), they’ve paid their dues at more pedestrian eateries: Ditto’s Bar and Grill, for example, in Louisville (“Eating Is Worth Repeating!”). Theirs is a ragbag experience worthy of Emma Lazarus.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">Officially, Elettaria presents a “seasonal, spice-driven American menu”—conventional fare adjusted at Nawab’s megrim. Small plates, which outnumber entrées, include a delicately rendered braised pig’s foot, covered with watercress, frisée, and flash-fried cashews. The dish is delightful; after all, when a pig rolls in the mud it does so off its feet. An invigorating crabmeat rezala comes with a turmeric-onion soubise and some crispy gnocchi—in essence, pea-size French fries. With the entrées, Nawab takes the familiar—steak, poultry, fish—and roguishly injects spices in ways unforeseen and unreliable. The roasted chicken, flavored with dehydrated-tomato powder, has an unfortunate hint of cured bacon, and its accompanying sweet-and-sour ravioli doesn’t help. But the duck and its keema-derived ragout bestow comfort via eight seasonings: onion, ginger, garlic, chile pepper, saffron, clove, turmeric, and—there she is—<em>Elettaria cardamomum</em>.</p><p data-wc="133" word_count="133">All this occurs in a kitchen that could be called open, except that that would intimate a degree of enclosure; Nawab and his crew are instead just there, their side and our side distinguishable only by a small, waist-high counter. The chopping and the stirring and the flipping are transfixing to watch. Nawab, who sports an insouciant, Clooney-like scruff, is swarthily handsome, and diners, notably women, eagerly approach to shake his hand. (Blame it on the Zombie Punch, one of the house’s more lethal cocktails, but a recent diner had to admit, “He <em>is</em> pretty good-looking.”) The rest of the place is a study in disjointed beauty: walls and curtains of different colors, mismatched lamps, a phony staircase. It’s interior design by cultural collision. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $18-$28.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

This ancient space, at the end of Commerce Street, was for many years Grange Hall, and before and after that the Blue Mill Tavern, and before all of it, yes, a speakeasy. Commerce’s owners, Harold Moore and Tony Zazula, have retained or replicated elements of those forebears—subway tilework, walnut banquettes, terrazzo floors—but they’ve gussied up the place, installing, for example, a coffered ceiling inlaid with three thousand tiny bulbs, it being harder than ever, apparently, to get the right glow. Nonetheless, the bustle and din (from neighborhood walk-ins and foodie brow-furrowers) remain tavernish. </p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">The food does not. There is no trace of succotash or other such favored comforts of the Grange. Moore, the former chef at March and Montrachet, is into clever combinations, debonair plating, dainty apportioning. It was a kick, one recent evening, for a table to pit opposites against each other: in one corner, a springy cucumber soup, with smoked trout and salmon roe, and, in the other, orecchiette with a ragout “of odd things”—tripe, pigs’ feet, oxtail. Garden versus Barn. Each was excellent, but being of divergent weight classes, they did not belong together in the ring. </p><p data-wc="211" word_count="211">Moore succeeds with less odd things, too. For example, the slow-cooked chicken (which, incidentally, comes to the table faster than the whole roasted chicken does) starts its life as a regular old boring skinless chicken breast, but after marinating for two days in buttermilk, then cooking for an hour and a half over really low heat, so that the protein coagulates gently and the meat remains soft, and then finally re-donning its skin, which has been pressed flat and thin between two sheet trays, and sautéed to a crisp, like a supersized potato chip (it would be cool to get a bag of them)—after all this, the chicken is very tender and tasty. And a leftover-meat trick that Moore learned from his Japanese grandmother—blacken in a pan, dress with scallions—inspires a beef tataki that is the one dish, among them all, that Moore has said he can eat every day. The desserts are incongruously fussy and dated-looking, in a tall-food kind of way (they are to your meal what the three thousand bulbs are to the room), but maybe this particular anachronism suits a place that tosses in so many odd things.

It’s the sort of place where, if you turn to ask the people at the next table how they like a certain dish, they are apt to invite you to try some. If the restaurant’s name lacks modesty, its renditions of the classics—<em>mapo</em> tofu, dry-sautéed green beans, <em>dan dan</em> noodles—really are spicier and tastier than those on offer elsewhere. <em>Ma la</em>, the trademark Sichuan flavor that combines numbing <em>ma</em>—Sichuan peppercorns (actually, crushed seedpods from the prickly-ash tree)—and spicy <em>la</em>—chile peppers or chile oil—is in abundant supply. The other night, the fish fillet in fresh pepper, a stew of flounder and greens with a scattering of crunchy red peppercorns, in a chile-oil broth, offered a transcendent, maybe mind-altering dose of <em>ma la</em>. It left the tongue vibrating between hot and cool, scorching and tingling. </p><p data-wc="244" word_count="244">Far more challenging, though, and not to be found on the menus of the standard-bearer Chinese restaurants in Manhattan, was the stinky tofu. It comes various ways—fried or sautéed, with peanuts or in spicy sauce—but none of the preparations mask the fact that it is, literally, putrid. The tofu is marinated in a rancid brine of vegetables that have been fermenting for months; there’s no polite description for the smell. (In Taipei, a vender of stinky tofu was recently fined for fouling the air. One suspects that, in the annals of malodorous foods, the stuff must be up there with <em>hakarl</em>, the Icelandic dish made with shark meat that has been fermented underground.) Those intrepid (or perverse) enough to find this prospect enticing should sequence their courses carefully. One theory holds that it’s best to have stinky tofu delivered at meal’s end, thus minimizing the time spent in its presence. Problem is, the experience takes some forgetting, and palate cleansers are few: Spicy &amp; Tasty doesn’t do dessert, and finding a nearby after-dinner drink is tricky. (What looks like a bar turns out to be a karaoke lounge slash massage parlor.) Better to have your stinky tofu early, admit defeat, and move on. “You don’t like it,” the waitress declared the other night, as she cleared the platter. Well, no. But who said liking it was the idea? (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $6.95-$22.95.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Designed by Tony Chi as part of a ninety-million-dollar renovation, it’s a bachelor pad writ large: walls of mirrors, divided into angled grids, like the peel of a disco ball; leather everywhere, even on the tabletops, in various shades of latte; and, flanked by half-stocked bookshelves, a minimalist gas fireplace in which a long ripple of flame seems to leap straight from stone. All that’s missing is a bearskin rug. </p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">But if the goal here is sly seduction, the service is slightly off-kilter. When asked which dishes best showcased the chef’s style, a waiter proclaimed, “All of them. It is like nothing you have tasted before.” Further details were not forthcoming: a pavé cut was described with karate-chop hand gestures (it turned out to be a square); the word “Lillet” drew a blank; and any question about an entrée was answered with a rearrangement of the ingredients already listed on the menu. (Of the spice-roasted cod with mustard greens: “We take the cod. We roast it with spice. There are mustard greens.”</p><p data-wc="195" word_count="195">The exaggeration does injustice to the chef, Kerry Heffernan, formerly of Eleven Madison Park. There are no pyrotechnics here: the food is straightforward (if highly refined) American, with a gracious nod to the season, and, for the most part, it’s quite good. Tender rings of flash-seared calamari in a lobster-coriander sauce are balanced against the delicate but unmistakable earthiness of a cauliflower custard; edamame-and-ricotta cannelloni, strewn with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, stand out as a rarity: a truly inventive vegetarian dish. Other offerings suffer slightly in execution. The wild-mushroom Martini, for instance, would be better if simply presented as a soup—its flavors are foresty and deep—rather than poured muddily into a glass, with a ghostly poached egg bobbing to the brown surface and a swampy mass of “spinach fondue” sunk below. Perhaps sensing something amiss, a waiter on a recent evening attempted to spark a conversation between two neighboring tables: “Look! Everyone is ordering the mushroom Martini!” The couples addressed looked over at each other, aghast, and then without a word turned back to their private whispers.

Bobo on a Tuesday: chic and laid-back, Harvey Weinstein holding court in one corner, Adrien Brody canoodling with a young woman in another, a nice bottle of Tempranillo. Bobo on a Thursday: crowded and noisy, girls with dangerously revealing décolletage and glittery green eyeshadow debating weight-loss methods, men in tight T-shirts hitting on the girls, rum-and-Diet Coke. On a Tuesday, the town-house setting, chockablock with old books and knickknacks, silver-framed family photographs, red drapes, and cascading crystal chandeliers, seems wonderfully intimate; on a Thursday, a diner took in the room and said sadly, “It’s so cheeseball.” </p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">Perhaps this split personality has its origins in the restaurant’s name: “bobo,” an abbreviated portmanteau of “bourgeois” and “bohemian,” is one of those terms which are used more often as denigration than as compliment. (It’s kind of like calling the place Yuppie.) Bobo’s menu proclaims its desire to become “a clubhouse for those with a modern perspective on old-fashioned fun.” At its best, the place captures that feeling of warmth and ease, but at its worst it feels labored and cynical. (Not the staff, though; any night of the week, the servers and hosts are gracious and accommodating.)</p><p data-wc="190" word_count="190">At least Bobo seems to have found its culinary legs. A spate of bad reviews in its early months led to the departure of the first chef, Nicolas Cantrel; in his place arrived Jared Stafford-Hill, formerly of Hearth. The kitchen puts out simple, nicely executed dishes: lamb, cooked to such tenderness that only a fork is required to pull it apart; a salad of refreshingly bitter greens, overlaid with slices of Serrano ham, offset by a sweet apricot jam. The Berkshire pork, rich and flavorful, is accompanied by bacon-stuffed potatoes that hit all the pleasure points: fat, salt, crunch. Other dishes are more disappointing: the chicken is just fine, but its bed of polenta tends toward the watery; a rhubarb galette has light, sugary pastry but not nearly enough fruit. Despite these little letdowns, though, it’s too bad that whether or not you go back to Bobo has less to do with the food than with when you eat it—a Tuesday-night diner left already planning a return visit, but a Thursday-nighter warned his companion, “Don’t make me go there again.” (Open daily for dinner.

Dismissed last year by Gordon Ramsay after an iffy start at his midtown restaurant, Ferguson decamped to the Lower East Side, where he has been—at least to judge from reviews and the covetedness of reservations—having the season of his career. In exile, Ferguson has certainly loosened up. Dinner begins, invitingly, with warm bacon rolls brushed with sage butter. The cheeses are domestic—Kunik from the Adirondacks and Bayley Hazen blue from Vermont, by way of Anne Saxelby’s shop, at the Essex Street Market. No carts, no domes, no trolleys. By contrast, one night not too long ago at Gordon Ramsay, when a man remarked that he had some Stilton in the fridge, the fromage guy shrieked, “You freeze your cheese?”</p><p data-wc="265" word_count="265">The service at Allen &amp; Delancey is less hyper-professional but more helpful. Recently, a waiter recommended a 2005 Artadi Viñas de Gain Rioja to accompany several appetizers, noting, “You won’t be able to get it anymore, because Parker just gave it, like, a ninety-five.” The bone marrow, however, raised the inevitable comparison to Prune, and Ferguson’s version did not prevail. For one thing, it arrives preëxcavated, which not only deprives you the pleasure of digging but calls attention to the marrow’s texture rather than its flavor, a bad bet with gelatinous foodstuffs (there’s a reason that escargot are more fun when they come with their shells). Paired with shallot purée, it’s a runny affair. Thematically, the “Pickles, Leaves, Fruits, Herbs, Fungi, Vegetable” preparation is more coherent, even if it does bring to mind a Lynne Truss sequel. There’s “soil” (a cocoa-based crumble) involved in the peanut-butter-chocolate tart, which tastes better than dirt but isn’t earthshaking. That’s how much of the food feels at Allen &amp; Delancey—fine, good, nothing special. Pleasant but indistinct flavors in the “Cabbage, Beef, and Onion” plate, inoffensive cod. The weird part is that it’s still a place you want to go back to. Part of this is because it’s situated in one of the loveliest rooms in town: dusky velvet curtains, low lighting, old books, oil paintings. Another is due to its underdoggish lack of narcissism: look above the bathroom sink and find, instead of a mirror, a portrait of a wizened crone. (Open daily for dinner.

There is the town-house location and discreet entrance, the understated décor, and the menu so emphatically New England in character that several of the ingredients claim to have come over on the Mayflower. Above all, there is the cooking, which never seems to falter. But where Blue Hill maintains earnest simplicity, Dovetail’s chef, John Fraser, indulges a taste for whimsicality, such as pairing skate wing and chicken wing, or deconstructing the New Orleans muffuletta sandwich: the traditional pressed meats and olive salad strewn in little piles across the plate and the bread replaced with two licks of lamb’s tongue, breaded and fried.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">Once you start looking, unexpected and inventive touches are everywhere. Fraser enjoys eye-catching matches—cod with cocoa beans, bass with bacon, monkfish with foie gras, oysters with sunchoke and pineapple. A tiny but dietetically deadly beef-cheek lasagna accompanying a sirloin steak was pasta-free, made instead with thin sheets of celery root, parsnip, and potato. But what impresses far more is the attention lavished on less showy details. A dish of white asparagus was remarkable not for its accompaniments of caviar and salmon tartare but because the asparagus came daringly close to overcooked, with a waterlogged deliquescence that remained just this side of mushy. The gnocchi, accompanied by off-the-bone short ribs, were so soft that they more or less reverted to being mashed potatoes.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">Many of the restaurant’s well-heeled clientele linger over their plates with the leisurely contentment of those whose children have long left home. On a recent evening, conversation encompassed the Democratic nomination (“There’s no way Hillary can match his beauty”), the gastronomic challenges of the neighborhood, and a brush with greatness (“Eliot Spitzer said to me—this was two days before it broke . . .”). Dovetail has plans to start serving afternoon tea soon, in what one suspects must be a heartless ploy to separate seniors from their savings. The dining room, dark and emphatically frill-less, seems to lack the requisite touch of Miss Marple-style gentility. Besides, is the cucumber sandwich really in urgent need of deconstruction?

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/07/egg-2	Egg	135 North Fifth St., at Bedford Ave. 	null	null	null	2008/04/07	<p data-wc="145" word_count="145">Three years ago, Egg began life as a breakfast spot, one of those no-nonsense joints that throw the doors open at seven, to feed and caffeinate bespectacled, Times-clutching L.L. Bean types, and don’t close them until the early post-meridiem hours, after the bedraggled, head-clutching Jim Beam types are all tended to. The in-between consists, mainly, of pancakes the size of pizzas. Egg’s breakfast still prevails in Williamsburg—trust the line—but after Sparky’s, a hot-dog palace that previously controlled the space’s evening rights, opted to concentrate on its East Village outlet, Egg got hold of the night shift. It’s a soft hold, the way one might grab, say, an egg. Three times a week, a child-size chalkboard appears on the sidewalk, indicating that, for a few hours, Egg will dim the lights and cook up a handful of dishes.</p><p data-wc="171" word_count="171">Egg’s owner, George Weld, is a sub-Mason-Dixon Line kind of guy (he was raised in Virginia and South Carolina, the son of a minister), and, if only as an exercise in nostalgia, his young kitchen offers a bang-up excuse to eat bad. “Can you really go wrong with salt, fat, and grease?” a diner commented the other night. Most of that salt, fat, and grease goes into Weld’s fried chicken, a recipe owed—and what regional dish isn’t?—to Mother. When a table ordered some, a waitress explained, “It’ll be forty-five minutes. There are five chickens ahead of you, and the fryer’s only got room for four.” The half-chicken that finally arrived, teetering on its new khaki shell, was gobbled up; the proof lay less in the empty plate than in the grease-spotted paper tablecloth. Sure, there are other dishes here—the scallops and pork belly, the steak and potatoes—but Egg has declared, as if for a middle-school philosophy test, that the chicken comes first.</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">A marked second, unfortunately, is the atmosphere. Egg’s walls are pocked with crude drill holes and San Andreas Fault-like fissures. Every twenty minutes or so, an overhead heater switches on, then off again, taking guests on a tour of the world’s climes. (“I feel like I’m going through menopause,” one woman said.) A sign in the bathroom veers toward the gas station-esque: “Please make sure to hold down handle for a good 8-10 seconds.” Still, self-respecting carb fiends don’t fret over such trifles. “You know, I’m not a foodie,” a diner said recently, nibbling on toasted pound cake. “But I’m a glutton.” (Open daily for breakfast and Thursdays through Saturdays for dinner.

To-go packages of salads and side dishes in a cooler suggest that the inventory doesn’t exactly fly off the shelves: that night, nearly everything in it was past the expiration date. </p><p data-wc="94" word_count="94">That the market seems unnecessary doesn’t detract from the table, and the restaurant’s name seems to connote less the rhythms of the seasons than the spirit of community. Once one gets a seat, it’s a place to feel at home, coddled and comforted, while watching, through enormous windows, as the rest of the world struggles by. (When rain lashes the glass, the effect is like being inside an aquarium.) With its rough-hewn wooden beams, a blackboard wall, and a curved, comfortable bar, the room manages to feel both airy and cozy. </p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">The food is reliably pleasing, particularly anything meaty, starting with the justly lauded burger: pillowy, juicy, with tangy Cheddar and sweet caramelized onions. The lamb shank, having been braised for two hours, was so tender that it nearly dripped off the bone, while an appetizer of gnocchi and short ribs was, counterintuitively, perfectly light. Seafood didn’t fare quite so well: the skate, while crispy, was too salty, the crab cake too dry. The pan-roasted monkfish was mushy, although the accompanying risotto, studded with chewy guanciale, was a creamy distraction from the fish’s inadequacies. At the end, the bill is served tucked into a book—“Twinkie, Deconstructed,” perhaps, or “The Rough Guide to the Beatles”—softening the blow with a bit of light trivia about, in the latter case, Ringo Starr’s acting career. (Highlight: he once played a “grunting Neanderthal.”) It doesn’t quite work, but it’s a nice try. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/24/chop-suey	Chop Suey	714 Seventh Ave., at 48th St., 2nd fl. 	null	null	null	2008/03/24	<p data-wc="110" word_count="110">Chop Suey is not a Chinese restaurant. That’s fitting, since the dish it is named after was invented in America. The food served here is, instead, vaguely Korean, as filtered through the mind and the taste buds of Chop Suey’s consulting chef, Zak Pelaccio. The term “consulting chef” is a kind of warning: don’t expect to see Pelaccio in the kitchen on a nightly basis. He’s likely busy with one of his other consultant gigs (230 Fifth, Borough Food and Drink) or collaborating with a fellow star chef on a side project (rumored to be in the works: a Southeast Asian barbecue spot and a European gastropub).</p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">A sense of absence permeates Chop Suey, which is semi-hidden on the second floor of the Renaissance hotel in Times Square. On recent visits, the dining room was barely a quarter full, which made it feel like a private aerie, perched above the neon ripple of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. The interior is refreshingly free of Asian kitsch, although the décor comes across as more designy than designed: biomorphic lipstick-orange leather chairs, ceiling fixtures that resemble giant toothbrush heads, china and cups with angles that are aggressively askew. </p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">The menu is, alas, similarly wayward. The scallion pancake, a dependable Chinatown staple, was either too salty or too bland, depending on the mouthful. A slow-poached egg, stirred into a stone pot of rice that had been (theoretically) spiked with chile, was a tasteless take on Korean bi bim bop. Ginger chicken, cooked <em>sous vide</em>, appeared<em> déshabillé</em>—a pale huddle of flesh that, if not in fact underdone, was suggestive of underdoneness. The kitchen fared better when it fell back on European technique, as with a lobster omelette, which gained body from a decidedly French beurre blanc.</p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">Just as Pelaccio’s ghost is glimpsed only in passing, so, too, is that of the pastry chef called in to “consult” on the dessert menu, the downtown radical Will Goldfarb, famed for using squid ink and pancetta in his concoctions. A flourless chocolate cake was perfectly serviceable, and forgettable, while “Vietnamese Iced Coffee” was Culinary Deconstruction 101: a condensed-milk sponge layered with chocolate Chantilly cream and espresso granite. The only hint of weirdness came with the pomegranate-poached pear: the fruit, stained violently incarnadine, sat in an unfortunate chartreuse soup, speared with what resembled, in texture, a dog biscuit. It looked awful. It tasted delicious. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $18-$32.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/17/smiths-2	Smith’s	79 MacDougal St. 	40.7287786428571	-74.0016486428571	212) 260-0100	2008/03/17	<p data-wc="83" word_count="83">Occupying a space between Caffè Dante and the New York Rifle Club that formerly housed a halfhearted Italian trattoria, Smith’s successfully, if slightly self-consciously, presents itself as a cozy little discovery. The central room—a narrow railroad-car space, painted cream, lined with black banquettes, and boasting a ceiling panelled with slightly foxed antique mirrors—feels both intimate and dramatic; it’s only when the place is very busy that you realize that it’s essentially a corridor leading straight from the kitchen.</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">The menu combines some new-American gestures (cue mentions of sunchokes, the Hudson Valley, and things being “line-caught”) with a style that is basically Italian: dishes include homemade <em>corzetti</em> (a coin-shaped pasta from Genoa) and a steamed egg with Gorgonzola-tinged polenta, which achieves a satisfying fusion of posset-like smoothness and cheesy tang. The chef, Pablo Romero, subtly enlivens well-worn favorites; roasted beets come with a horseradish cream that provides the very gentlest of kicks. Indeed, accompaniments sometimes outshine main dishes. Recently, the dryness of a filet of striped bass was soon forgotten thanks to the wintry gratifications to be found underneath it: flageolet beans, <em>guanciale</em> stew, and leek fondue. Occasionally, the intricacies seem a little overdone. Romero has a radical way with brussels sprouts, peeling them like cabbages and tossing the leaves with oil and slivered almonds. Ingenious, certainly, but the sprouts, deprived of their tight, balled crunch, emerge as a sorry and laborious simulacrum of potato chips.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">The restaurant’s casual sleekness seems ideally pitched to a clientele of well-heeled but unostentatious thirty- and forty-somethings. The mellow atmosphere reaches a kind of laid-back climax in the tiny bar at the back, which has velveted walls that somehow put one in mind of the Frick. Here you can eat from the main menu or enjoy such neo-bar snacks as Parmesan truffled devilled eggs. On a cold night, the bar is deliciously snug, and it’s accordingly packed. At busy restaurants, it’s not unusual to be offered a spot at the bar if there’s no table ready. Here, waiting for a place at the bar late on a Friday, you may be asked if you wouldn’t rather simply eat at a table instead. (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/park-avenue-winter	Park Avenue Winter	100 E. 63rd St. 	37.8500521	-122.2545767	212-644-1900	2008/03/10	<p data-wc="174" word_count="174">In recent years, the resolutely sedate Park Avenue Café tried and failed to recruit younger diners with gimmicks like Pay Your Age; last year, it closed. The owners have since remade the place as an ode to the four seasons, with the restaurant’s décor, menu, and name changing quarterly. What began as Park Avenue Summer was done over as Park Avenue Autumn; now we have Park Avenue Winter; soon it will be Spring, and so on. Compounding the loopiness of it all, the décor is said to be inspired not only by the seasons but also by the voyages of Captain James Cook. As the restaurant’s Web site puts it, “Winter pays homage in part to Cook’s travels in the Antarctic Circle, combined with a classic drawing room aesthetic.” Don’t bother parsing that too closely; instead, think vases filled with bare branches, chandeliers, and lots and lots of white. The look suggests a fancy restaurant not on the Upper East Side but somewhere else—Narnia, maybe, or Heaven.</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">Fortunately, the homage to Cook’s Antarctic Circle journey doesn’t extend to the menu. (When provisions ran low, the captain and his crew dined on penguins. Cook’s assessment: “I cannot say they are good eating.”) Park Avenue Winter interprets the idea of seasonalism loosely; with its citrus fruits and Florida-stone-crab claws and other food shipped in from warm places, this isn’t Blue Hill uptown. Some of the offerings are pleasing and hearty (a paper bag full of chestnut fritters to start, the paradoxical “roast chicken coq au vin,” potato latkes). But other dishes, while undeniably tasty (the fluke sashimi with persimmons comes to mind), are the antithesis of hearty. When it’s warm outside, you want to eat cold things; when it’s cold out, you crave warmth. This place, with its “Coldwater Raw Bar” and special “Winter White” menu of all-white food, has the equation backward.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">Undeterred by all the changes, many of the old Park Avenue Café patrons keep coming, lending the place a neighborhood vibe almost in spite of itself. (There is lots of it’s-such-a-small-world chatter in the background: “You see that woman with the crazy hair—I saw her in another restaurant last week” and “So nice to see you twice in one day” and “We’re all at the Regency, so we all have the same umbrellas!”) The executive pastry chef, Richard Leach, actually gets winter, so once dinner has been cleared, there’s an incentive to linger. Pears poached in red wine, warm gingerbread, pecan biscotti served with hot buttered rum—these are balms fit for dreary weather. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/03/fiamma	Fiamma	206 Spring St. 	35.0524402320037	-83.2000038960081	212-653-0100	2008/03/03	<p data-wc="227" word_count="227">With its high prices, ambitious cuisine, and faltering service, Fiamma has a bewildering, bubble’s-end air. Mishandled decadence can seem cautionary. The knowledge that Fiamma is part of a restaurant company called B. R. Guest prompts speculation about strategy: a foursome dining there one recent not too busy night, next to a table celebrating a woman’s admittance to Harvard Business School, decided that Fiamma’s existence must have something to do with a strong euro and the proximity of the Soho Grand hotel. During the evening, a bartender attempted to make a Martini without vermouth. Several dishes arrived cold. The paccheri—giant tubes of pasta, with pancetta and lovely strips of <em>puntarelle</em>—were, in any country, way undercooked, a parody of al dente, reminiscent of college-era water-to-pasta miscalculations. A bottle of wine showed up twenty minutes after it was ordered, well after the main course had begun to cool, and not for lack of conveyance—the ratio of servers to serving is high here. Coat retrieval was FEMA-like. Is it snotty to grumble about such things? Perhaps, but not when you’re paying two hundred bucks a head. Fiamma is all prix fixe; the bottom rung is three courses for eighty-nine dollars. Throw in Barolo, tax, and tip, and, <em>boink</em>, you’ve been Londoned. What needs fixing, it seems, is the process rather than the prix.</p><p data-wc="195" word_count="195">Fiamma raises such high hopes. The room is handsome, the greeting solicitous; the menu itself is refreshingly straightforward, while the dishes it describes are provocative and complex. An amuse-bouche arrives: tuna tartare with a tempura beet leaf, an exquisite little thing. The executive chef, Fabio Trabocchi, who came to Fiamma six months ago, is faint of neither heart nor sauce; he lays it on thick, in a manner that, as adoring reviewers have noted, is in some ways more French than Italian. The first course featured a few glimpses of sublime invention: a delicate fleet of carpaccio, in miniature corseted thimble-size portions, like sushi; “la testa,” a kind of pork sausage seared and doused in a chestnut-based cream, like sin; roasted lobster with monkfish foie gras. (Monkfish foie gras!) Trabocchi’s widely praised lasagna, prepared in the manner of the Italian region of Le Marche (nominally the source region here), somehow simultaneously has the heft of ragù and the airiness of phyllo. Still, an accumulation of little blunders can suck the spirit out of a fancy meal. B. R. Guest? O.K., then, B. R. Host. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/25/the-smith-2	The Smith	55 Third Ave., between 10th and 11th Sts. 	null	null	null	2008/02/25	<p data-wc="148" word_count="148">The two-way, four-lane, Jane Jacobs-hostile stretch of Third Avenue just below Fourteenth Street is flanked by the likes of Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, and seems to be a staging ground for a shock-and-awe campaign against the arteries. Last fall, Glenn Harris and Jeffrey Lefcourt turned a former Pizzeria Uno space into the Smith, and, whether intended or not, embraced the drag’s blandness. “What’s with the name?” a waitress was asked recently. “Well, the owners were thinking Blacksmith or Ironsmith or even Foodsmith,” she offered. “But they didn’t want to be too specific.” Generality appears to be a Harris/Lefcourt trademark—they named their Greenwich Village spot Jane, as in plain—and the new place is nuance-free, all blacks and whites. (White subway tiles and black-and-white photos of Victorian nudes line the walls.) Smith, the owners seem to be reminding us, is Everyman’s surname.</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">So does Everyman eat here? “Oh, we get all kinds,” the waitress replied. “All ages, all ethnicities, all genders.” A canvass of the room, though, revealed mainly N.Y.U. kids, and the Smith’s atmosphere evokes a fraternity house, with the acoustics of a rush-season kegger. Servers toss around collegiate slang (“Riddle me this, Batman,” a diner was asked recently. “Can I take that dead soldier in the corner?”), while the menu tends to the sophomoric: one can begin a meal with the Pink Pussy Cat, a specialty cocktail, and end with the Pink Pussy Cat, a strawberry sundae. As in any respectable frat house, the real action occurs in the basement. Here, an antique barber’s chair sits next to an old-school photo booth, while the adjoining wall is equipped with a peephole that grants access to vintage porn flicks. All this, plus a flirt-friendly communal washroom.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">So the other night two recovering frat guys and a former frat sweetheart were prepared to indulge in a little recidivism. But a bowl of warm potato chips smothered with melted blue cheese and a lipid-infused bacon-and-egg appetizer went barely touched. A pork chop brought to mind a salt lick, and a burger slathered with “special sauce” seemed to pose legitimate issues of copyright infringement (the waitress noted, “We have a Filet-o-Fish on the menu, too”). By evening’s end, surplus fries were being woefully played with, and a “big carafe” of red wine remained a quarter full. Grimly, it dawned on the table’s senior member that a ten-year college reunion was just around the corner. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner and Sundays for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/11/dellanima	Dell’Anima	38 Eighth Ave., at Jane St. 	null	null	null	2008/02/11	<p data-wc="104" word_count="104">Early in the evening, the back door of this tiny <em>enoteca</em> is often left ajar, to reveal the red neon sign of the Corner Bistro across the street. Inside, youthful attitude and precocity abound. The executive chef, Gabe Thompson, previously worked at Le Bernardin and Del Posto but has never run a kitchen; the general manager, Joe Campanale, a former sommelier at Babbo, is only twenty-three years old. The patrons—suits and just-back-from-Turks-and-Caicos tans—nestle in sleek banquettes, so high that their feet dangle, or perch at a bar overlooking the chef and his two line cooks, working feverishly in a tiny open kitchen.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">The food is both faithfully Italian and surprising. An order of bruschetta might include toppings of chickpeas perfumed with preserved lemon or a “lily” confit of translucent bulbs (shallot, onion, garlic) whose pallor belies its intense flavor. Glossy cuts of pork belly are strewn with persimmons that implode when pricked. In the pastas, ingredients are pleasingly textured, whether in a chunky calamari <em>ragù</em> (spooned over squid-ink fettucine, a cute joke) or a savory mix of sage, Fontina, and shaved Brussels sprouts. Standards like wild boar and seared tuna are given new contexts, the meat atop mascarpone-rich polenta, the fish surrounded by chestnuts, crisped artichoke, and a velouté-like swath of sunchoke purée. Other dishes seem designed primarily to stoke your thirst, like the chicken “al diavolo,” rubbed ferociously with smoked paprika, or a salty serving of ricotta ravioli. This is food as the consort, not peer, of drink. Fortunately, the wine list is fairly democratic, although it’s easy if you’re ordering by the glass to wind up with a single pour that costs more than your entrée. (A dark, moody Sangiovese was a breathtaking twenty-five dollars a pop.)</p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">Dell’Anima has a stylish brashness that can be the cause of some uneasiness. On a recent night, two long-term denizens of the neighborhood (four decades and counting) were shunted nearly out of sight in a back corner. “Anaïs Nin once lived in our building,” one of them said. The couple reminisced about the site’s former tenant, Freddy Ristorante, where they’d often celebrated New Year’s Eve, then admitted that they did, in fact, like Dell’Anima’s food. Still, they couldn’t quite give their hearts to the new kid on the block. “The people moving in here now aren’t artists,” the wife said wistfully. “They’re businessmen.” (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/04/omido	Omido	1695 Broadway, between 53rd and 54th Sts. 	null	null	null	2008/02/04	<p data-wc="122" word_count="122">Set amid the restaurant equivalents of garishly bloated Broadway musicals, Omido appears more akin to an Off Broadway production of Beckett. (Or, given its proximity to the Ed Sullivan Theatre, more David Letterman than Jay Leno.) Its incongruity is due largely to its AvroKo design: among the tourist claptrap and lit-up marquees, it’s cool, spare, and stylish. The wood slatted front promises privacy, with peepholes that forestall claustrophobia; Edison light bulbs, encased in soccer-ball-size globes, dangle over the bar; candles inset into nooks provide a waterfall of flickering light. In the back, hundreds of twists of paper—<em>omikuji</em>, paper scrolls that, here, foretell good fortune—are suspended just underneath the low ceiling, creating the effect of a net full of feathers. </p><p data-wc="155" word_count="155">Omido seems to have earned its devotees: in the early evening, almost every seat is filled, and one might see a diner, crossing paths with the sushi chef, bow deeply in homage. On a recent night, by way of recommending the excellent mango parfait for dessert, the server pointed to a couple sharing one a few tables over. “She sometimes comes here just for that!” he said. “Ask her!” The sushi is almost uniformly superb—yellowtail given heat and crunch by a sliver of jalapeño, a roll of lobster and avocado luxuriously subtle. The Big Omido is overstuffed, with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, cucumber, avocado, <em>tamago</em>, <em>kaiware</em>, <em>kanpyo</em>, <em>tobiko</em>, eel, <em>oshinko</em>, and <em>yamagobo</em> packed together into a drainpipe-size roll. (Although it quickly falls apart, each bite of fish is impeccable.) The short ribs, braised in soy sauce, are rich and succulent; chilled vegetables in a dashi broth offer a delicate entrance into a meal. </p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">The menu falters, though, over what are obviously meant to be showstoppers. Gold-leaf accents couldn’t ameliorate the mushy texture of the bluefin-tuna tartare, or redeem the disastrous combination of salmon and foie gras in the <em>temari</em> roll. A waiter’s fervent recommendation, one evening, of both the lobster (wan in flavor, rubbery in texture) and the filet mignon felt more extortionary than sincere. By 9 <small>P.M.</small> the place is close to empty, and the service—at first efficient and courteous—becomes languorous and offhand. Perhaps it’s best to leave before the curtain drops.

The area caters to the tastes of the young and the liquid: Kingswood is a shabby-fancy pub, P*ong is a high-concept laboratory, and, just across the street, Bobo (short for “bourgeois bohemians”) aims to re-create “the excited din of a dinner party” for people who have probably yet to throw one. The most promising of the lot is Bar Blanc, whose owners—Kiwon Standen, Didier Palange, and the chef César Ramirez—quit their jobs at Bouley to go West Village.</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">Standen says that the décor—stone, leather, a lot of <em>blanc</em>—was inspired, in part, by Miami, which lends the place a smooth glamour that’s been missing lately, amid the English libraries and urban farmhouses, from the New York dining scene. “It looks like a naked body in a negligee,” a middle-aged man was overheard observing recently, referring to a textured white brick wall. It actually looks more like a mattress pad, but, either way, its bedroomy connotations are obvious. Unfortunately, the welcome can be less seductive; one night, an apparently unoccupied hostess was so slow to greet a couple or to take their coats that you wondered if, in her lassitude, <em>she</em> had been inspired by South Beach.</p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">The food, though, is ambitious: when you see slow-cooked organic chicken with brie-potato purée on the menu, you think you’re getting the standard cold-weather comfort dish, but the chicken arrives off the bone, with drumstick sausages, and the potatoes are so silky as to be almost more a sauce than a starch. Ramirez has a way with pasta, too. The braised-lamb-shoulder lasagna is an elegant take, and, in the orecchiette with mustard-braised rabbit, the mustard isn’t just a flowery descriptor—you can feel it in your sinuses. The prices, though, should be tweaked: the portions are too tiny, and the staff too green, to merit fourteen-dollar salads and several entrées in the thirties. Plus, the restaurant, now in its second month, is still operating with a frontier mentality. “It’s a great neighborhood,” Standen said recently. “We run over to P*ong to borrow butter and cash-register tape.” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

The second thing is that nowhere on Toloache’s menu is the potent blossom employed. That’s the sensible (and probably the only legal) option. But the subtle tease points to a larger question: for whom, precisely, does Toloache aim? A green-and-purple neon sign, a neon-caked bar offering a bajillion tequilas, and a gaudy triptych of, one supposes, the goddess of <em>toloache</em>, beckons spendthrift tourists, but the leather banquettes, white tablecloths, and an impressive, inventive menu seem to speak to well-heeled Upper East Siders.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">One can hardly blame the chef, Julian Medina, for his restaurant’s identity crisis. A native of Mexico City, Medina aspires to take Mexican cuisine, once and for all, out of the dank beans-cheese-and-sour-cream cellar. (No free chips and salsa here.) The menu, then, is a kickshaw-crammed affair. A yellowfin ceviche with chunks of watermelon tastes like a spongy Jolly Rancher. Both a braised-beef-tongue taco and a taco filled with foie gras, mango, and refried beans are discomfitingly kooky. Simple, more refined items, though, like the roasted-tomato salsa and the <em>frutas</em> guacamole, made with quince and flecked with pomegranate seeds, are sumptuously buoyant and piquant. A black-truffle quesadilla, with huitlacoche salsa, is near perfect. The entrées are reliable, though many are smothered in sauces that nearly negate the meat beneath.</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">Medina’s kitchen may serve up heaps of daring, but his staff, it seems, is firmly grounded in authenticity. In front of a rear brick oven used to make, among other dishes, <em>queso fundido</em> and <em>huevo ranchero</em>, two prep cooks peel and pit avocados with alarming prowess. And those accents are genuine. Inquire about a grasshopper taco and hear, “I was born in Oaxaca. We used to catch them in our backyard by the handfuls. They are delicious!” Curious, lifelike, not delicious. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $18-$26.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Last Valentine’s Day, a couple from the neighborhood, Silay Ciner, a Turk who grew up in Istanbul, and his wife, Jill, who is from Denver, opened Peri Ela, a block south of the Y. The food is traditional Turkish, but the space, formerly home to a Greek coffee shop, of all things (<em>Molon lave!</em>), is what you might call Manhatto-Turko-NATO chic: exposed brick, pressed tin, semi-nudes on wood-panelled walls, Amy Winehouse on the stereo. “All the Turkish restaurants in the city have that ethnic, <em>touristique</em> look about them,” Silay (pronounced “Sly”) said the other night. “You know, the kilim, the Oriental rugs, the hookahs. I didn’t grow up in that kind of atmosphere. In Istanbul, there are hundreds of restaurants like this one.” </p><p data-wc="213" word_count="213">On most nights, the Ciners stand near the door, greeting their expanding roster of regulars, who, as per Upper East Side custom, tend to find an entrée they like and stick with it. When you ask the Ciners (or a waiter) about a dish, you often hear about its popularity rather than its ingredients, about which they are uncommonly secretive, perhaps to foster the impression that the recipes have been smuggled at great risk across the Bosporus. But what does it matter, when the popularity is justified? Among the many excellent small dishes, or meze, are <em>tarama</em> (a rich carp-roe spread), <em>ezme</em> (a gazpacho-like spicy veggie purée), and two versions of <em>patlican</em> (eggplant)—<em>salatasi</em> (smoked and mashed, with olive oil and garlic) and <em>soslu</em> (diced and fried, with a tomato sauce). In terms of justifiable popularity, perhaps nothing trumps two comfort-food classics: <em>manti</em>, diminutive beef dumplings in a garlic-yogurt sauce, and the lamb-kebab <em>yogurtlu</em>, grilled chunks of meat floating in a bath of yogurt and soggy pita bits. The portions aren’t overwhelming, but in case of kebab-and-phyllo overdose, a restorative shot of raki, an anise-flavored liqueur served with water and ice, can help rationalize an extra round of rice pudding.<em> Lezzetliydi! </em>(Open daily for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/01/07/tailor	Tailor	525 Broome St. 	30.6735742069035	-81.4603151581043	212-334-5182	2008/01/07	<p data-wc="116" word_count="116">It’s been said that nobody likes watching sausage get made, but, apparently, not many people like watching places where sausage (well, chorizo-cured <em>kampachi</em> with potato granola) gets made get made, either. Tailor was supposed to be a huge hit for Sam Mason, the scruffy, hubristic, famously gonzo pastry chef from WD-50. For months leading up to its opening, the fooderati chronicled Mason’s every move, preordaining, through their heated interest, his restaurant’s importance. Mason, who gave regular accounts of his misadventures in management for a blog, did his part—or more than it—to stoke the hype: I’m picking out tiles! The chefs are going to wear coats with snap-together buttons, like cowboys!</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">By the time Tailor was finally ready, in September, opinion had turned against Mason. “Maybe everyone wouldn’t be hating on him,” someone wrote on Eater.com, “if he didn’t do a sixteen part mini-series of douchebag musing prior to his ‘long awaited’ opening.” Certainly, there’s more than a pinch of the grandiose at Tailor. After the waitress has trumpeted the micro-sorrel in the <em>kampachi</em> and the micro-greens in the monkfish, you start to wonder if that raisin in your slice of bread might not, in fact, be a micro-grape. But the backlash is unfair: Mason is trying interesting, weird things here, and more of them taste really good, or at least make you think, than not. The dining room should be fuller than it has been.</p><p data-wc="177" word_count="177">Tailor’s specialty, across the menu, is flavors that don’t occur together in nature: pork belly and butterscotch, a befuddlingly appealing Scotch infused with pumpernickel. The sweet stuff has lots of salt—beet ravioli with cocoa caviar?—and the salty stuff has lots of sweet. Peanut butter, cocoa caramel, and something called “pear soil” don’t do much to improve “the foie”—as a waitress referred to it recently—but a dish of roasted duck, spaghetti squash, raisin <em>dashi</em>, and chanterelles (tiny as thumbtacks) is absolutely magnificent. Given the sugariness of most of the main offerings, dessert is pretty unnecessary, and one, the rum-braised banana with mustard ice cream, is downright scary: a banana is frozen and dehydrated into a large chip—a phallic fossil. If you’re in an adventurous mood, it’s better to order another drink. There’s the Bazooka, made with bubble-gum cordial, or the Asa Gohan, which means “breakfast food” in Japanese and is supposed to taste like a bowl of Grape-Nuts.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/17/back-forty	Back Forty	190 Avenue B 	null	null	null	2007/12/17	<p data-wc="141" word_count="141">Traditionally, the “back forty” is the most far-flung parcel of land on a farm, where, out of sight, it’s easy to be up to no good. At this recently opened East Village spot, however, the phrase has a more innocent connotation: it refers to the acres a farmer sets aside from his regular crop, for planting whatever he fancies. Certainly Back Forty is a playful departure for its co-owner and chef, Peter Hoffman, who has helmed the sophisticated Savoy, in SoHo, for seventeen years. Back Forty proclaims itself, somewhat disingenuously, to be a mere burger joint—but the burger is made of grass-fed beef that’s thrillingly juicy and the impeccably crisp fries are sifted with rosemary-laced sea salt. As at Savoy, the buzzword here is sustainability, with a seasonal menu that reflects Hoffman’s longstanding relationships with local growers.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">Back Forty shies away from outright rusticity, preferring Shaker simplicity, albeit as if filtered through the mind of John Pawson: the walls are spare and high, adorned here and there with ikebana-esque groupings of antique farm tools, tall glass cylinders stacked with apples, and curiously shaped gourds with elongated necks; electric candelabra are suspended from the ceiling in clear globes. There are touches of quaintness—a glass of wine comes to the table in a milk quartino, water is poured from recycled whiskey bottles, and candles flicker inside canning jars—but the china is resolutely modern, and the over-all ambience is one of easy, improvisational elegance. </p><p data-wc="180" word_count="180">The philosophy behind the cooking is just as deceptively simple: confront the ingredient. Flavors are asserted, never masked, resulting in dishes that are vividly contrapuntal. The almost shocking bitterness of radicchio is met by earthy cranberry beans and cubes of feta embedded with crushed almonds, hazelnuts, cumin, and coriander. Familiar vegetables and legumes take on unrecognizable forms: lentils are as small and delicate as caviar; cauliflower, melded with Gruyère, bread crumbs, and leeks, achieves uncanny tenderness (and perfectly mimics macaroni and cheese). Occasionally the accompaniments nearly upstage the main dishes, like the cilantro salsa verde lightly drizzled over the whole grilled trout or the kicky smoked paprika mayo, which one might feel compelled to put on everything. Cocktails, mixed at a twenty-two-foot bar of reclaimed pine, reveal a similar attention to detail; the standout is the Loisaida Sling, which gets its sass from cachaça and ginger beer dashed with chipotle—an eye-opener that will remind you that Avenue B was once a walk on the wild side. (Open daily for dinner and Sundays for brunch. Entrées $10-24.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/kyo-ya	Kyo Ya	94 E. 7th St. 	37.8080158	-122.306058	212-982-4140	2007/12/10	<p data-wc="63" word_count="63">Kyo Ya specializes in <em>kaiseki</em>, a form of cuisine said to have originated in sixteenth-century Kyoto, initially as an accompaniment to the tea ceremony. To eat the full, ten-course meal at Kyo Ya, you have to book a day or two in advance, since esoteric ingredients are shipped from Japan. (The regular menu, however, can be ordered anytime, and abounds with similar dishes.)</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">The ambience is calm, the clientele largely Japanese, and the interior full of gorgeous details. A wall of rippling wood swoops near the bar; men’s and women’s toilets are marked by a fern and a flower, respectively. Plates, from thinnest glazed porcelain to chunky, asymmetric, almost volcanic stoneware, become an art form; you’re unlikely ever to see the same plate or sake cup twice. Despite the precision, there’s no anxious effort to impress, and you get the feeling that the staff would prepare food this elaborate even if they were just eating it themselves. </p><p data-wc="242" word_count="242">And it is elaborate. Pressed sushi is covered with a thin speckled film of kombu, edible kelp: it looks as if lacquer had been applied over the rice. A simple apéritif of <em>shochu</em>, garnished with tiny morsels of pear cut in leaf and star shapes, tastes the way you imagine dew might. Monkfish liver is presented in a vase of pebbles, abalone on a cushion of salt; you get to sear small rectangles of beef on a terrifyingly hot shiny stone. Dried mullet roe (which you grill over an open flame) looks like carrot, has the consistency of bean curd, and tastes like anchovy, only more so. Coupled with a rectangular tablet of daikon radish, it looks uncannily like a mah-jongg tile. <em>Aigamo</em> duck comes with a cake of <em>mochi</em>—a kind of rice polenta with a texture between dough and string cheese but stickier than either. (In Japan, people occasionally suffocate while eating it.) The <em>kaiseki</em> meal culminates in a dish that might seem plain: steamed rice. But the silvery Koshihikari rice from Uonuma is highly prized, and here it is served with condiments including twice-grilled salmon as light and brittle as a cracker and as salty and desiccated as jerky. If you can’t finish, you might be given a <em>kaiseki</em> doggy bag: rice balls encased in nori seaweed, and wrapped for the journey home in a bamboo leaf. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner. Dishes $9-$32; <em>kaiseki</em> from $120.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/03/stonehome-wine-bar	Stonehome Wine Bar	87 Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn 	40.6873818	-73.9748891766563	718-624-9443	2007/12/03	<p data-wc="128" word_count="128">The ever-popular wine bar poses something of a categorical conundrum. Many wine bars relegate their foodstuffs to the side—a composed cheese plate here, slender panini there—and seem to be little more than pretentious watering holes. The best, though, like Stonehome Wine Bar, give the culinary as much attention as the oenological. Situated on the garden level of a brownstone in Fort Greene, with stone mosaics, a curving cherrywood bar, and faux-suède seats, it’s tucked away but clearly sought out. On a recent Thursday evening at nearly eleven o’clock, there was a full house of drinkers and diners alike—many, it seemed, had wandered by after the Sufjan Stevens performance at BAM and were relieved to find a place for dinner at that hour. </p><p data-wc="203" word_count="203">Bill Stenehjem and Rose Hermann, a couple and longtime residents of the neighborhood, opened Stonehome in 2003, and in 2006 they brought in John Gibson, formerly of Veritas and Lucy’s of Long Island, as chef. Gibson is certainly unafraid to offer hearty fare with flavors that challenge—and amplify—those of the wine. A fennel salad, delicately doused with orange vinaigrette, featured tangy pickled beets; pork meatballs, bobbing in a bowl of smoked-pork broth and cannellini beans, were rosy in the middle, with just enough Taleggio cheese oozing out. The entrées tend toward the colossal, like the pork shank, which looked almost prehistoric in its heft, and was braised until it fell tenderly from the bone. Thick slices of venison came with creamy, ancho-chile-spiked sweet potatoes and a bitter-chocolate sauce. As for the wine, no flowery descriptions here—recommendations are made straightforwardly, with no extraneous information. A bit more might be nice: when a waiter offered either a Pinot Noir or a Burgundy to accompany the duck, there was little forthcoming about why those two, or what differentiated them. But the choice held up; the Pinot turned out to be tart, almost astringent, and it cut nicely through the richness of the fowl. </p><p data-wc="67" word_count="67">No wonder diners came in all sorts of configurations—couples, young and old, in various stages of infatuation; a group of Germans, caught up in some urgent debate; a trio of twenty-something women, picking at a cheese plate. One, sipping a glass of Chardonnay, said wonderingly, “Can you believe that in college all I ever ate were bagels and ramen?” (Open daily for dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/11/26/blt-market	BLT Market	1430 Sixth Ave., at Central Park S. 	null	null	null	2007/11/26	<p data-wc="112" word_count="112">The term “branding” has become the haute restaurateur’s euphemism for “franchising.” The latter is Applebee’s and Bennigan’s; the former Nobu, Craft, and BLT. Both sets have multiple locations, in multiple cities, but those who brand also have celebrity chefs, cookbooks for sale by the hostess stand, and $92 rib-eyes. Case in point: the “bistros” of Laurent Tourondel (hence BLT) will soon number fifteen, among them BLT Prime, BLT Fish, and BLT Burger; with outlets already established in Washington and Puerto Rico, next month Tourondel will plant a BLT Steak in White Plains. The way this trend is curving, look for BLT Frozen in your neighborhood grocery by New Year’s.</p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">How Tourondel, a Frenchman who began his career as chef to an admiral in the Marine Nationale, became an arbiter of American steak and fish houses remains something of a mystery. His newest venture, BLT Market, aims to institutionalize the ever more popular locally produced/organically grown/seasonally available food fetish. The restaurant, in the Ritz-Carlton (another fine franchise), off Central Park, is adorned with antique farm tools and, at this time of year, buckets of McIntosh and Honeycrisp apples. The menu changes monthly, listing what’s currently “peak in season,” and is found clothespinned to your napkin, as if it were just blowing in a country breeze. November’s bounty, in case you’ve misplaced your Farmer’s Almanac, includes sunchoke, salsify, Meyer lemons, and spaghetti squash.</p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">On a recent evening, there was an endive salad, dotted with candied walnuts and marinated figs, and a Hudson Valley foie gras delicately offset by an orange-grapefruit vinaigrette. A flavorful rack of lamb rested in a hearty artichoke-and-porcini ragout, while an entrée of “semi-smoked” salmon, capped with a dollop of American caviar, curiously straddled the line between lox and sashimi. All in all, the food might whet an agronomist’s appetite, but it would more quickly drain his wallet: pasta with an ounce of Alba white truffle, for instance, went for $470. Across the room, two Stock Exchange types lingered over a rare wine. “Should I get the $120,000 Lexus or up it to $140,000?” one asked. It’s a difficult decision, regardless of the season.

But “take street food, and make it gourmet,” as Einat Admony, the chef at Taïm, a falafel shop in the West Village, says she aims to do, and the result is elating. Her gussied-up chickpeas feel like a steal to the same degree that Vongerichten’s dressed-down lobster feels like a cheat.</p><p data-wc="212" word_count="212">Admony, a veteran of a million venerable kitchens around the city, met Stefan Nafziger, her co-owner and husband, in 2001. She was working at Danube; he was a manager at Bouley. When they decided, two years ago, to go out on their own, the idea was to recall the beloved snacks of her native Tel Aviv without sacrificing technique. And so there they are every day, jammed into a three-hundred-square-foot storefront (that <em>includes</em> the kitchen), chopping parsley for tabbouleh, grinding spices, slicing potatoes for their excellent homemade French fries. (Dip them in the saffron aioli and acknowledge the inadequacy of ketchup once and forever.) Admony makes her own harissa, a Tunisian chile-pepper paste that spices up Taïm’s most popular falafel. Also on offer are “red,” with roasted red pepper, and “green,” flavored with parsley, mint, and cilantro. They’re both a go. Israeli salad—dud order, right? Not here: a lemon-mint dressing braces the mild vegetables, and the tomatoes, miraculously, are never mealy or pink. The pitas, made by a guy in Brooklyn, are toasted on the stove, to induce a crust, and served hot as can be. Admony brushes them with olive oil and a mixture of sesame, salt, and zatar, an herb that grows on a mountain near Jerusalem.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">Admony also makes smoothies, which is a bit like pointing out that Michael Jordan played basketball, too. Most nights she mans the blender, dumping pre-apportioned ingredients from plastic ramekins and bags. (You get the feeling that she spends a lot of time at the Container Store.) For a date-banana drink, a familiar combination in Israel, she adds lime to cut the sweetness; another mixes strawberries, raspberries, and Thai basil. The line out the door is done the American way. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dishes $3.25-$9.50.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/11/12/kefi	Kefi	222 W. 79th St. 	38.9850480821918	-94.5919665068493	212-873-0200	2007/11/12	<p data-wc="204" word_count="204">Kefi, Michael Psilakis’s casual Greek outpost, looks imposing from the outside—it’s set in the garden level of a stolid limestone town house on the Upper West Side—but once down the steps and through the heavy door you find yourself in an awkward lobby-bar, with shrunken white benches posed in a face-off. The space previously housed Onera, Psilakis’s first effort at high-end Greek (Anthos, in midtown, is his second), and was transformed in a single day by the staff themselves, who hung drapes and lanterns and replaced the fancy furniture with narrower, more crammable versions. In the dining room, at the back, the high-decibel, rapid-turnover ambience gives Kefi the hectic feel of an airport food court besieged by people of no discernible relation to one another: professorial types in sandals and socks; habitués of Lincoln Center in jabots, clinking glasses with a “Chin-chin!”; ponytailed twenty-somethings bearing Banana Republic shopping bags. Neighbors swiftly become confidants. On a recent night, one young lady was overheard confessing, “I almost went to the Guggenheim today, but I was afraid I’d have <em>too much time</em>”; another broke into hysterics over her date’s pronunciation of “mous-sa-KA.” (The correct Greek way, for the record.)</p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">The food, though, is often revelatory in its sharpening of familiar, classically Greek flavors. A banal-sounding “selection of spreads,” for instance, features a voluptuous pale-rose taramasalata. Meatballs are surprisingly light and airy, with a sauce forcefully studded with garlic cloves and shards of olive. Grilled octopus melts quickly in the mouth; curlicues of fried shallots set off bombs of salt amid creamy sheep’s-milk ravioli; cinnamon sweetens the delicate strands of pulled braised rabbit. The moussaka comes “broken,” in steamy, disintegrating layers, because it’s made fresh, the ground beef and béchamel tossed in the pot to order. Each bite sends a ripple of heat through the chest, like a shot of ouzo. </p><p data-wc="60" word_count="60">It’s almost enough to make you well disposed to your voluble neighbors and the hurtling wait staff, who are raffish and indefatigable, if occasionally a bit too carefree. One, asked for the name of a decadent potato concoction (<em>skordalia</em>), just shrugged. “Beats me,” he said. “They don’t make us learn Greek here.” (Open nightly for dinner.

El Quinto Pino, the sophomore effort of Heather Belz, Mani Dawes, and Alexandra Raij, the owners of the much praised Tía Pol, is the kind of spot that by pedigree and authenticity appeals to those who pride themselves on being in the know. In ethos, El Quinto Pino, like its progenitor, runs counter to the recent tapas growth spurt, which has entailed both a proliferation of the term (now often used to refer to any kind of shared plates) and the expansion of portion size, to the point where four or five dishes between a pair don’t merely satiate but stuff. </p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">By contrast, here it seems as though you could order the entire menu—confined to a small blackboard hung above the bar—and feel only moderately gluttonous. A stew of chickpeas was smoky and laced with spinach; four garlicky shrimp arrived still bubbling with heat. A more unconventional option was the pig’s-ear salad, served cold and with a vinegary dressing. The ears, carved into bite-sized chunks, were a little gray, and gristly; one could easily imagine them flapping against a porcine skull. (It didn’t taste bad, exactly, but it was the only dish left unfinished.) Slightly less shocking (and infinitely more appealing) was the sea-urchin panini, a slim cylinder of baguette slathered with butter, spice, and briny, aphrodisiacal roe.</p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">The space is a mere sliver, about half the size of Tía Pol, and there aren’t any tables—you pull a stool up to the bar or you stand. You’re not meant to linger, though you’re welcome to—the bartenders are friendly, and ask your name (mainly to keep track of the orders, but it feels sincere). At the end of the evening, racking his brain for the great Thai place out in Queens that he insisted a diner had to try, the bartender asked for an e-mail address. A few days later, the message arrived; he still hadn’t remembered the name, but in the meantime he’d collected a list of the chef’s favorite restaurants and food carts. He had scribbled them onto a napkin and then scanned the whole thing in; conveniently, it could be downloaded onto an iPhone. (Open daily for dinner.

Whether the resulting fusion does much for American tastes is another question. In a Gramercy Park Hotel so fancy it’s no longer like the Gramercy Park Hotel, you find yourself eating Chinese food so fancy it no longer tastes like Chinese food.</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">The long, narrow room is done up in a kind of opium-den chic, with tasselled curtains and satin sofas in raise-the-red-lantern red and black-pearl black. Friendly waiters walk you through a menu that’s short on explanations. What is Chin Shan? It means “clear aroma,” a waitress says, and involves steaming ingredients at the table with oolong tea poured over hot rocks: “It’s like a green-tea facial for food.” But lobster and vegetables, lying innocent of all flavor in a bamboo basket, seem none the better for their spa treatment. Such airy nothings are hard to take seriously—a problem for a place with the ambitions, and the prices, of Wakiya. And there are too many revamped versions of Chinese standbys which are less enjoyable than the unvamped originals: Peking duck came with leaves of duck skin, not as crispy as they should be, affixed to prawn crackers.</p><p data-wc="162" word_count="162">But there are plenty of good things. Shanghai soup dumplings look like the sort of ice pack that Lucille Ball would clutch to her head, and disgorge a satisfying broth that is offset by strands of ginger in the accompanying vinegary sauce. Fried rice is wrapped in an omelette and flavored with XO sauce (which is made from some twenty kinds of spice and dried seafood and labor-intensively re-creates the comforts of MSG). The most exciting thing on the menu is the Signature Mango Pudding. This arrives flamboyantly: a tiny dish atop a tea kettle that billows great clouds of lychee-scented vapor. (There’s dry ice inside.) The pudding itself appears to be simply pieces of mango lightly crushed by hand, but it’s subtly anchored by cream and gelatine. The presentation may be a decadent gimmick, but it’s a really good decadent gimmick. As soon as the dry ice subsided, the table ordered another. (Open daily for dinner.

Inside, diners are ensconced in dimly lit private cells, curtained off by bamboo blinds and connected by shadowy stone-slab-and-pebble walkways. Servers are discreet; they appear almost instantaneously at the press of a call button, but otherwise the blinds stay drawn. One night, over the soft hum of jazz standards, the only evidence of other patrons was the not so faint sounds of a make-out session. Two unsuspecting guys (“Wanna grab a bite tonight? Hit that new Japanese place?”) were left to fidget in their chamber and chat uncomfortably about ex-girlfriends.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">Thankfully, Zenkichi’s sake list doubles the length of its menu, and such unease can be quickly ameliorated. The Wakatake Onikoroshi (“Original Demon Slayer”) and the Suirakuten (“Heaven of Tipsy Delight”) did the trick, though the Escher-esque layout of the dining rooms, complete with wall-length mirrors at every turn—and there are lots of turns—makes a case for moderation. The food, in portions meant for sharing, aims for innovation and arrives with astonishing celerity. The <em>maguro </em>carpaccio, drizzled in sesame oil and white soy sauce, had a refreshing, sweet zip. The <em>anago</em>-and-cream-cheese tempura felt delightfully gluttonous; the cream cheese may have overwhelmed the saltwater eel, but no matter. A <em>tsukune </em>chicken, packed in a hollowed-out bamboo stick and speckled with sesame seeds, looked pretty and tasted better, but the grilled <em>saikyo</em> black cod, advertised as a chef’s favorite, was a bland disappointment.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">The meal concluded, after a radioactively pink dessert of grapefruit jelly, with a dozen bows and thank-yous and an inquiry into a diner’s favorite item by a particularly earnest waitress. “I’ll tell the chef,” she said. “We must improve for our customers.” A few patrons, evidently wishing to continue their night of intimacy, were spotted wandering hopefully across the street to scope out a shop called Mikey’s Hook Up. The moon was out, and the name seemed promising. (Open Wednesdays through Sundays for dinner. Dishes $5-$13; tasting menu $88 for two.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Among the melodramatic accoutrements—cascades of melted wax, dangling hams and gleaming copper pans, gothic chandeliers—the sense of artifice is so great that one wonders if the massive wooden beams might be hollow, the wrought iron just bits of tin. One recent evening, a trio of young women—long blond hair, clingy black dresses—pulled out a camera and called the waiter over to take a group shot. “Sorry, ladies,” he said. “We don’t allow cameras, because we have lots of celebrities who eat here, and they get really nervous.” A diner, hoping for star sightings, craned her neck. “Is he famous?” she asked, pointing to a raffish young gentleman who was commanding a long table of hangers-on. “He’s not a celebrity,” her companion observed. “He just thinks he is.”</p><p data-wc="269" word_count="269">As far as make-believe goes, Gemma offers—with remarkably flattering lighting, comfortable leather banquettes, and a cast of attentive servers—a soothing dose of escapism. And, while food isn’t really the point, the kitchen manages to turn out some appealing items. An entrée of sea bass, cooked and served on a thin cedar plank, was flaky and moist. Zucchini blossoms were crisp and delicious, as fried things tend to be, and a squid-ink pasta was perfectly sauced—lightly enough to allow the pasta’s flavor to emerge. But the flops are major. A special “truffle” pizza arrived with a meagre sprinkling of mushrooms; the <em>prosciutto cotto</em> came in oddly thick, salty chunks. After a bite or two, the table gave up; the waiter insisted on bringing something else. “We want to make you happy!” he said. A <em>burrata</em> pizza arrived a few minutes later—better, but, still, the dough tasted weird, as if they’d used twice as much flour as they were supposed to. With the order of a calzone di Nutella for dessert came an ominous omen: foot-long serrated knives, laid out on the table with ritual solemnity. The calzone arrived on a pizza board, glistening, dusted with powdered sugar, the size of a deflated football. “I’m a little nervous,” a guest admitted. “I don’t think it’s natural to eat something that big.” Some sawing, and the skin was breached. The Nutella and ricotta oozed out, coagulated unappealingly on the wood, and tasted as though it could rot even the sweetest tooth. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/10/01/borough-food-drink	Borough Food & Drink	12 E. 22nd St. 	29.806814	-95.3894909	212-260-0103	2007/10/01	<p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Borough Food &amp; Drink is a quizzical twist on the “locavore” movement, whose adherents insist on eating food grown close to home. Borough’s co-creator and contributing chef, Zak Pelaccio, has assembled a menu that relies primarily on products found in the five boroughs—those raised, assembled, or imported by local purveyors—and that also finds occasional inspiration in various neighborhood or ethnic mainstays, such as the deep-fried pickle or the knish. It’s a nifty conceit, but also in some respects a fraught one, since anything this Borough can do, someone in a real borough can probably do better. It’s not so much an all-star team as it is a fantasy-league squad.</p><p data-wc="155" word_count="155">Still, you root for the place, out of both civic patronage and civic pride. The sight, by the entrance, of a deli counter stocked with various delicacies (Di Palo’s ricotta, De Lillo’s biscotti, olives from the Pickle Guys) and then, ringing the dining room, of shelves arrayed with canned and jarred exotica (fish balls, mushroom ketchup, pickled thyme) bolsters that allegiance. (All these condiments are for sale.) But there’s something about the space that feels distinctly un-New Yorky. Despite all the reclaimed wood and the vintage fixtures, the atmosphere, as well as the service, brings to mind that of a brewpub in a renovated warehouse in a not-quite-reviving industrial town. The dimensions of the room gobble up its thematic aspirations and may account for why the restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow’s previous attempts in this space (Rocco’s and Caviar &amp; Banana) failed. If Borough can make it here, it can make it anywhere.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">The menu is as uneven as it is wide-ranging. The Shan Dong dumplings, from Allen Street, have an authentic tang. The <em>guanciale</em>-and-ricotta flatbread is a delicious appetite-spoiler, as are the pork sliders—miniature pork-shoulder burgers, accompanied by a tasty pickled Macedonian pepper. A seared hunk of striped bass, with clams and chorizo, delicately invokes the waters separating the boroughs, and a mound of onion rings not-so-delicately summons thoughts of people travelling under and over those waters. Of special note are the macaroni-and-cheese pancake, a desiccated discus that is a tribute (and a fitting one) to Shopsin’s, and the duck salad, which a diner recently described as “rank.” Maybe all it needs is a dash of mushroom ketchup. (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner, Saturdays for dinner, and Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $12-$28.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/09/24/pong	P*ong	150 W. 10th St. 	42.3309696	-83.0681779	212-929-0898	2007/09/24	<p data-wc="144" word_count="144">In haute-cuisine circles, it often seems that food is considered art first, sustenance second; aspiring chef-auteurs create increasingly high-tech dishes, stacking and sculpting ingredients—liquefied, freeze-dried, or otherwise rendered unrecognizable—into improbably cantilevered façades. Even so, Pichet Ong may be the only chef in New York with an actual master’s degree in architectural design (and whose Web site launches with a quotation from Brancusi—“Simplicity is complexity resolved”). His eponymous restaurant, P*ong, has an imposing, conceptual décor (recently spotlighted in <em>Interior Design</em>): slinky white Eero Saarinen-style chairs on single stems; illuminated geometric cutouts in a curved wall of pale ash veneer; mirrors etched with Takashi Murakami-esque flowers. With mirrored disks on the ceiling and electronica on the soundtrack, the space-pod-cum-disco feels dismayingly at odds with its sleepy West Village brownstone block. One begins to fear the elaborate confections to come.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Yet Ong—who made his name as a pastry chef for Jean-Georges Vongerichten—manages to make an appealing marriage of innovation and tradition. The menu is constructed as a set of small plates, divided into savory, sweet, and somewhere in between. So blurry are the boundaries that a dish classified one night as savory—cognac-laced foie gras, its earthiness tamped under a crust of burnt sugar—later migrated to the liminal zone. The foie gras is emblematic of Ong’s approach: the flavors are classic but the textures startle. A Bloody Mary is reimagined as a salad of heirloom tomatoes, bracing horseradish dressing and vodka jelly, and an ingenious frozen celery purée. Wild-morel-and-polenta pudding, served in a miniature cast-iron skillet, has a creaminess surpassing that of ordinary macaroni and cheese.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Occasionally, the thoughtful tips too far toward the cerebral (and the baffling). A waiter dispatched to spritz cachaça-lemongrass mist over a shrimp-and-mango seviche held the atomizer bottle at a distance, as if slightly offended to find himself on cosmetics-counter duty. And some ingredients, while likable when taken individually—an expertly seared scallop, tingly chamomile ice—lack chemistry when paired. Still, watching Ong work in the cramped open kitchen is fascinating: there’s barely enough room for him and a sous-chef as they labor feverishly back to back, with only a pint-size convection oven and a single brûlée torch between them. Perhaps Ong has taken to heart another Brancusi maxim: “Create like a god, command like a king, work like a slave.” (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $12-$22.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

The place—a commissary/newsstand/tavern/oyster bar, and, most recently, restaurant—is pure ironic-nostalgic pastiche. Sausages dangle from the ceiling as if to evoke turn-of-the-century Little Italy; the waiters wear butcher-style aprons, and sometimes mustaches, for a dose of Five Points. In the cabinet-of-curiosities mode so beloved these days by hip New Yorkers, the bathroom is filled with salvaged obscurities: a youth-brigade photograph, an old doctor’s scale, and a candle stuck in a jam jar. The effect, heightened by the blue nimbus of the looming Williamsburg Bridge, is something like Ellis Island by way of Epcot. But the fact that—in addition to fresh baked goods (plum-nectarine galette, poppy-seed cake, pizza), whole milk, novelty toothbrushes, and a selection of vintage gums—the storefront shop stocks <em>Cosmopolitan</em> assures us that the period pose is all in good fun.</p><p data-wc="221" word_count="221">Despite its hodgepodge leanings, when it comes to food, Marlow &amp; Sons takes a purist stance. In a corner of the back dining room, an oyster shucker plies his trade with an alacrity that would have pleased Boss Tweed. Shuck, scrape, sniff. The stout Malpeques and dreamy Wiannos arrive, decked with lemon wedges, on mounds of shaved ice. It’s for the common benefit that no cocktail sauce is provided. An appetizer, too, gets a municipal twist: the bread is semolina, crusty and corrugated enough to bring to mind rye, topped with strips of pancetta and a sweet-butter schmear. The skate wing comes with a “creamless creamed corn,” so close to the real thing that it makes you wonder if the chef, Caroline Fidanza, could also make us believe it’s butter. One end-of-summer night, there was on offer a special salad of basil, radishes, and nectarines. The nectarines were all pick of the litter; their pink-and-orange speckled skins brought to mind a mackerel sunset, and the wish that August would last forever. A little boy, wearing light-up sneakers, approached the shop counter, proffered some wadded bills, and emerged with a slice of white pizza. When he returned, two minutes later, for a granita, Marlow &amp; Sons started to seem like its very own thing. (Restaurant open daily for dinner. Entrées $14-$22.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

A pair of stately silver-haired gentlemen—accompanied by their twin-set-and-pearls-wearing wives—were complaining to the hostess about the mayhem at the door. “The place is modelled after a meat market in Lockhart,” she drawled. “Maybe it’s a little harder to handle here, but it’s how we do it in Texas.”</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">Taking the Kreuz Market model—where patrons buy barbecue by the pound, grab a few other provisions, and enjoy a quick meal—and applying it to a bi-level restaurant, with two bars and a performance stage, does create problems. After you fight through the scrum to put your name on a list, finally receive your “meal ticket” (on which countermen mark your order), get to your seat, and take in the instructions—no plates, cocktail service only, a fifty-buck fine if you lose your ticket—you stand in line for meat, and again for sides, and once more for drinks. The last and the shortest line is the cashier’s. One senses that the place is all hat and no cattle.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">But then the cattle come home: dry-rubbed and smoked for nearly a day, until the meat is juicy, salty, and spicy—sans sauce, Texas-style. The “brisket moist” and the pork spareribs are especially savory, and the beef ribs are huge and pink and plead for unseemly gnawing. For the timorous, the beer-can game hen is succulent, if a little boring; you’re left pondering the advantages of cooking with a beer can. Conversation is discouraged, most nights, by the raucous live acts, including, not long ago, CBS News’s Bob Schieffer, who was fronting the D.C.-based band Honky Tonk Confidential. Sample lyrics: “Excuse me, bud, before you intrude. I ain’t some ‘Brokeback Mountain’ dude.” Maybe the music ought to be left to Texas. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/09/03/ramen-setagaya	Ramen Setagaya	141 First Ave., between St. Mark’s Pl. and 9th St. 	null	null	null	2007/09/03	<p data-wc="155" word_count="155">Long known in the U.S. merely as a staple of dorm-room hot plates, ramen has now risen high enough in culinary estimation to have its own battles of braggadocio. When Ramen Setagaya, the first American outpost of a Japanese chain, opened in June, its manager provoked food-blog controversy by claiming that its broth was more authentic than that of the current ramen heavyweight, Momofuku (which, defenders pointed out, never professed to serve “traditional” ramen, anyway). All this over noodles and broth? Still, there seems to be an insatiable appetite for the stuff. On a recent evening, the line to get a seat on one of Setagaya’s stools was twenty deep. “It’s like ramen ‘Iron Chef,’ “ one waiting diner said, peering through the plate-glass window at the open kitchen and the clouds of steam engulfing the cooks. (In fact, the founding chef, Tsukasa Maejima, has competed in a televised cooking competition in Japan.)</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">Once inside, it felt like a tiny slice of Tokyo. Laminated menus were printed in both English and Japanese; the flat-screen TV on one wall noiselessly broadcast gleefully bright Japanese variety shows; the kitchen staff shouted out orders of <em>cha-syu</em> (roast pork) and <em>oyako-don</em> (chicken and egg served over rice). There’s not much to choose from on the menu, but plenty of information. The broth: pork bone, chicken, chicken bone, Raus seaweed, Kishin seaweed, dried mushrooms, dried scallops, dried anchovies, garlic, ginger, cabbage, red pepper. The salt in the broth: Khanh Hoa salt, a “naturally sun-dried crystallized sea salt—more than salt, bitter, sour, and even a little sweet.” The bamboo shoots are soaked in the broth, to “harmonize better”; the noodles are topped with dried scallop, “fried and grinded to a flake.” </p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">The particularity pays off. In the <em>shio</em> ramen—<em>shio</em> means “salt,” and refers to the base of the soup—thin noodles swim in a light, fresh broth, accompanied by a gelatinous pickled egg, fatty, tender slices of grilled pork, bamboo shoots, and seaweed. The <em>tsuke-men</em> ramen separates noodle from liquid; the ramen is thicker and chewier, the broth deeper and saltier, mingling scallops with chunks of pork. (There are also “deluxe” versions, but that just indicates an extra portion of noodles.) The food comes fast, and the pressure—always polite—is for a speedy turnover; still, you’ve hardly had a happier half hour, even if it took twice that long to get in the door.

A few years ago, it occurred to someone that the church’s gated terrace would make a nice spot for lunch or a beer. Terrace restaurants tend to fight shy of culinary fireworks, but this year the café has reopened under the management of the food-service giant Sodexho. Clearly aiming to fancy the joint up a little, Sodexho has appointed Matthew Weingarten, formerly of Savoy, as a “consulting chef,” to overhaul the menu, and is building him a big new kitchen for a year-round indoor restaurant at the site, to open later in the year.</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">For now, the restaurant attempts to straddle the divide between casual and upmarket. At lunch, the menu offers individual items like lobster rolls and pizzas, and a two-course prix fixe. On balance, the casual option seems better. Sitting at the twenty-seat circular bar, you find yourself to the right of two blue-shirted, signet-ringed men tearing into hamburgers with smoked-onion rémoulade and saying things like “I like Romney: his business record is impressive” and to the left of a pair of women judiciously leaving half their B.L.T.s and saying things like “I’ve always dated older men.” It’s a Friday, and everyone seems to have ordered Pinot Grigio. </p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">In the evenings, the neighborhood is more or less deserted, and the restaurant, bustling at lunch, must rely on a few tourists wandering in by mistake. Nonetheless, the kitchen’s ambition produces a successful <em>crudo</em> of wild king salmon, which exploits the buttery taste of salmon belly, and a beautifully cooked trout laced with an <em>agrodolce</em> sauce. But things have a way of going wrong, too, as with a dish of oily sturgeon and watery grilled vegetables. And the small number of diners might have something to do with an even more absent staff. On a recent evening, three tables left in frustration at the wait, a confused server orbited the entire terrace with an order of pork before returning with it to the kitchen, and, as night descended, it seemed that the only satisfied diners would be the mosquitoes.

Less famously, Jake Gyllenhaal, as a teen-ager, washed dishes for the chef Marco Canora, who was in the midst of his first big-time gig, at Tom Colicchio’s Craft. Canora and his partner, Paul Grieco—following their success with Hearth, in the East Village—opened Insieme four months ago, at the Michelangelo Hotel. The other night, Gyllenhaal called Canora there. “Sure, come on over,” Canora told him. </p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">Gyllenhaal brought his mom. It’s that kind of place: not too noisy, safe for the parents. Or so it seems. The restaurant’s unprepossessing room and unprepossessing locale promise mere proficiency but deliver profligate flavor and spirited service. Take the wine list, compiled by Grieco, and packed with musings about Britney Spears and Pope Bertrand. (It’s more enlightening than it sounds.) Cabernet Sauvignon, Grieco writes, is the offspring of Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Franc, who “apparently got together in the spring of 1456 after a chamber music concert”; reason No. 3 to drink rosé wine (there are nine) is that “Jim Morrison always consumed a bottle before sitting down to write poetry.” Whatever Grieco’s having, it’s powerful stuff.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Sommelier shenanigans aside, the food at Insieme, which the menu lists in two iterations, “Traditionale” (i.e., Italian) and “Contemporary” (i.e., Italian-inspired), is totally serious. But not self-serious—a crucial point. Canora knows better than to mess with <em>lesso misto</em>, for instance, serving the boiled meats tender and accompanied by condiments, in the classic fashion. But the man’s got imagination. Fish <em>crudo</em> (salmon belly, tuna, and hamachi, plus a big, gloopy oyster) is packed into a ring hacked from ice, while the beef-<em>in-brodo</em> appetizer is cleverly echoed by an amuse-bouche of “egg-drop soup.” Plum soup tastes a little cough-syrupy, but a dish of candied red currants gush when you bite into them and gleam like rubies.

You can get a drink to take in while you see the show—cabaret, burlesque trapeze, Margaret Cho. The tavern itself has two floors, three bars, and two rows of stage lights, and is cluttered with so much prop-shop bric-a-brac—bulls’ horns, an antique iron, an album cover for “Music to Help You Stop Smoking”—that you may feel as if you are on the set of a play about an eccentric new restaurant in an old zipper factory.</p><p data-wc="167" word_count="167">In homage to the neighborhood, the tavern serves its own artisanal sausages and other charcuterie, along with homemade sauerkraut and mustard (and, in the same vein, some gummy potato pierogi). The meats aren’t bad—it’s hard to quibble with bratwurst or fatty slabs of bacon. But the Zipper happens to be across the street from the headquarters of M. &amp; T. Pretzel, the city’s hot-dog-cart kings, and one wonders whether it might be as gratifying, and less laborious, to grab a water dog from one of the returning venders. The menu nods in a dozen other directions—conch salad here, sloppy joe there—and you may find yourself exclaiming, as a diner did on a recent evening, “This place is all over the place.” Some of these places were very nice. The Zipper salad (beets, peas, greens, mizuna) was delicate and fine, and unlikely to be duplicated over at M. &amp; T. A block of monkfish, with fava beans and chunks of chorizo, had agreeable heft.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">Enthusiasm for these and other dishes, as well as for the bar’s wide selection of Scotch, tequila, and beer, led to some messy meal-sharing, and, by dinner’s end, a tablecloth you could sign and hang on the wall. “<em>We’re</em> all over the place,” the diner amended. The waiter didn’t seem to mind: it was a slow summer-holiday night, and he and his colleagues had been sneaking tequila shots. The bill came tucked inside an old thrift-store hardcover, “Quite Unexpected,” by Ismay Thorn, which suggested that the feeling, whatever it was, may have been mutual.

Greenmarket produce and locally sourced meats have become so commonplace that it’s nearly impossible to simply enjoy a tomato without considering matters of pesticides, provenance, and sustainability. So when, last year, two restaurants with agrarian appellations opened in Brooklyn, both emphasizing seasonal ingredients and regional purveyors, it hardly caused a stir. And though there are surface similarities—neo-rustic décor, spare and lofty, with earthy details like big, plain cupboards, dark wainscoting (at Flatbush), and pressed-tin ceilings (at Adderley)—each perfectly reflects its own distinctive neighborhood. </p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">At the Farm on Adderley, in Ditmas Park, this means a relaxed, friendly atmosphere; it’s the kind of place where you can bring your yoga mat to dinner and not feel awkward. One Sunday evening, big tables held families with jostling children; nearby, two silver-haired women sipped glasses of scarlet-tinged rosé. The food is precise and unpretentious, served on mismatched china: a chilled cucumber-and-avocado soup, sea-foam green and laced with olive oil, had a tangy sweetness that was juxtaposed with a salty dollop of crab salad; the buffalo-mozzarella salad was a pleasing variation on the standard <em>caprese</em>, pairing green apple and arugula with soft, fresh cheese. The striped bass was laid over a pile of crisp vegetables—asparagus, radish, fava beans—and mussels, with pickled fennel offering a piquant jolt. </p><p data-wc="184" word_count="184">Flatbush Farm, on the border of Park Slope and Prospect Heights, strikes an edgier attitude. The menu commands, “Eat Is, Imbibo Is, Teneo Is” (“Eat it, drink it, know it”); the garden, strung with Christmas lights, is outfitted with a grill, for the restaurant’s monthly cookouts (spare ribs, burgers, beer). The food tends toward sophisticated versions of classic dishes (presented on mismatched china, natch). The perfectly balanced French-dip sandwich had just enough tender roast beef, bitingly hot horseradish, and a rich <em>jus;</em> the smoked-salmon appetizer set thick whorls of salmon alongside charred, crisp points of brown bread and a heap of fennel. Oddly, it’s the distribution of produce that seemed to pose a problem: the rabbit pappardelle scarcely yielded evidence of its promised vegetables; both the rhubarb tart and the strawberry shortcake suffered from a dearth of fruit. Did the harvest fail to come in? (Flatbush Farm: Open weekdays for dinner, weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $14-$24.

There’s an obvious infatuation with whimsy. Dishes are given irreverent names, from the succulent pork sandwich (giving a server opportunity to announce, with relish, “Here’s your Pig’s Ass!”) to flights of cheese (“Lady Sings the Blues,” “Those Crazy Kids!”). It’s a lighthearted approach backed by some serious credentials: Brian Keyser, a co-owner with Joe Farrell, has worked at the Union Square Café and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, and the <em>fromager</em>, Tia Keenan, comes from the Modern. </p><p data-wc="165" word_count="165">Casellula is not a place for the calorie- or fat-averse (though a waitress said, wonderingly, “We do get people who don’t want any cheese at all”). Ordering your greens in the form of the endive salad? You’ll get huge hunks of blue cheese, generously strewn macadamia nuts, a swathing of dressing—oh, and some crunchy leaves to scoop it all up. Many things are perfect in their excess; the macaroni and cheese, for instance, was a deliciously gooey combination of Fol Epi, Comté, and chèvre, chewy lardons, and sweet carmellized onions. Other dishes can suffer from indulgence. A fig flatbread was piled with prosciutto and thick shavings of Pecorino, and slathered with fig compote—all those vigorously competing elements end up underwhelming. And it’s hard to imagine anything more obstreperous than the Sweet Action sundae, with beer ice cream, beer caramel, orange whipped cream, and, most egregiously, a sprinkling of barley that adds little flavor and the texture of wood shavings.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">As for the place’s raison d’être: the cheese selection is wide-ranging, laid out in easy-to-comprehend categories, and expertly garnished. A Hawthorne Valley Farm Bianca, with the fresh, tangy flavor of cottage cheese, arrived with a sweet lychee; a pungent Mecox Bay Dairy Atlantic Mist was tamed by a curried green tomato. “Working here has made me socially unacceptable,” a waitress complained, “because my clothes all smell like cheese.” Time to find some new friends. (Open weekdays for dinner, weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $8-$13; flights of three cheeses $15.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Even so, Dieterle (along with his partner, Alicia Nosenzo) has a lot to live up to at Perilla—guess who’s coming to dinner? The Zagats <em>and</em> the Nielsens! He mostly pleases both the foodies and the fans. </p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">There’s the location, on a Village side street packed with neighborhood standbys—an understated spot, as if to say, “I’ll always remember the little people.” The staff go about their business with an informed yet unscripted aplomb, and do the small things right, like allowing customers to transfer their tabs from bar to table without a hassle and presenting each with one slice of brown, crusty bread in lieu of offering an overblown basket. Sometimes the safe quality of the surroundings (fancy light fixtures, framed photographs of clouds and trees that recall those motivational posters that promote “INSPIRATION” or “TEAMWORK”) veers into the unmemorable. It’s endearing, though, to see Shakespeare’s Sonnet CVI hanging on a wall, “just because,” as a reservationist said, “the owners liked it.”</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">Production values aside, the food is a hit, with poppingly fresh herbs and vegetables (fiddlehead ferns, water spinach, pea tendrils, Okinawa yams, parsley root) that do more than their usual share of the work. Excepting pork belly and meatballs, the menu is inventive—Dieterle combines ricotta and cherries in a signature salad, offers a wonderful dish of pan-roasted New Zealand langoustines, and garnishes a sautéed skate wing with cabbage slaw and pastrami. (The lemon-fennel doughnuts, though, would be better if they weren’t shaped like dice and spongy in the middle.) Two women, long finished, are left alone to linger over their wine. One goes to the bathroom and returns to bemoan flickering candles and an unflattering mirror. “I looked like a German milkmaid crossed with ‘The Blair Witch Project’!” That’s as close to Hollywood as this place gets.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/07/02/provence-2	Provence	38 MacDougal St. 	40.7270972857143	-74.0028084285714	212-475-7500	2007/07/02	<p data-wc="137" word_count="137">When Michel Jean opened this homage to his native region, in 1986, it became a neighborhood institution, and, until it closed, a year ago, made its quiet corner of SoHo seem like a piece of French sovereign soil, with its Bastille Day pétanque tournaments and Beaujolais bacchanals in November. Now Marc Meyer and Vicki Freeman (who also own Five Points and Cookshop) have taken on the task of remaking an old favorite for a city in which French bistros are as common as Irish pubs—and sometimes about as French. They spruced up the interior a little but left essentially untouched its two greatest assets: a long windowed frontage on the street, open in the summer, and two delightful rooms at the back, in which floral displays and large skylights give the effect of an indoor garden.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">The menu, bearing an epigraph from the Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral, has the sort of regional feel you might expect—the sauces abound with olive tapenades and orange zest, and specialities like <em>pissaladière</em> and bouillabaisse occasionally appear—but it ventures as far east as gnocchi and as far south as couscous. At its best, the cooking, aided by a well-chosen array of predominantly southern wines, succeeds in transporting you to a sunny Arlesian fantasyland. The chilled asparagus-and-spring-garlic soup, for instance, is the deepest green imaginable, and its taste, verging on grassy, exploits a bitter note at the vegetable’s heart. Grilled porgy is an American fish seemingly on vacation in Marseilles, its belly filled with oregano and bay leaves. Sadly, though, many dishes lack definition and character. Beef daube ought to be vigorously rustic, but here, notwithstanding beautiful baby turnips, it was simply underseasoned. A special of grilled rabbit was unforgivably dry, as parched as a midsummer’s day in Haute Provence. In fact, many of the most successful dishes are the less exciting choices—hanger steak, duck rillettes, or anything from the small but excellent raw bar.</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">Perhaps the restaurant ought to channel <em>terroir</em> more thoroughly, giving ratatouille and <em>soupe au pistou </em>a permanent spot on the menu, unleashing capers and lavender at every turn, and dredging up a few Provençal curiosities (sheep tripe and feet, anyone?). Not that the restaurant seems to be suffering any lack of popularity. There are certain restaurants that people just want to like, and it’s hard to go very wrong in premises so obviously appealing.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/06/25/palo-santo	Palo Santo	652 Union St., between Fourth and Fifth Aves., Brooklyn 	null	null	null	2007/06/25	<p data-wc="163" word_count="163">Tucked in the middle of a mostly residential block in Park Slope, this polished new restaurant feels so of a piece with its neighborhood it’s as though it sprang up fully formed. An evening’s meal, in its fresh simplicity, might have had its origins in the nearby Co-op: there’s a crisp chayote salad, with tart, juicy grapefruit; wahoo with a roasted plantain, served in its blackened skin; a satisfying chicken mole. The staff is warm and casual, and the experience is pleasing, though not exactly transcendent—it’d be easy to write off Palo Santo as a place to go when you aren’t up for a culinary challenge. But everything is not as it seems. In the same way that the familiar lines of the restaurant’s brownstone building are offset by an intricately curlicued wrought-iron railing, the regular menu provides a stage for the tasting menu, which offers rigorously constructed dishes that use ordinary ingredients to surprising effect.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">The nine or so courses take in a wide variety of heat and texture: on a recent evening, they included delicate grilled trout, set on top of radishes, green beans, and purple potatoes; braised pork shank, soft and steeped in wine; a superb strawberry-rhubarb crisp, with a slightly salty crumble on top, tempering the ripe sweetness of the fruit. Jacques Gautier, the chef and owner, leaned over the counter that separates the open kitchen from the dining room, to provide commentary. Of the trout: “I was doing a TV segment and I came up with this dish, kind of weird but nice and colorful. I thought I’d made it up, but then I was in Bolivia and they were serving it there, on the street.” He had particular enthusiasm for a Mexican Zinfandel that accompanied the pork: “It’s from Baja California. The soil where they grow the grapes is kind of salty, there by the ocean, and you get that little whiff of saline in the nose.” His contagious charm smoothed over some of the lesser moments: a forgettable<em> ceviche misto</em>, an uneven entrée of rabbit done three ways.</p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">Gautier and several artists spent a year and a half meticulously renovating the restaurant’s interior, combining local and exotic elements. The wood for the tables and chairs was salvaged from demolition sites nearby on Fourth Avenue; a mural of a stylized Andean landscape stretches across one wall. On weekend mornings, sunlight floods through the cathedral window; the turquoise touches on the walls give the dining room an aqueous cool, and the scent of oranges is in the air. (Open weekdays for dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $16-$23; tasting menu $45 per person, or $75 with wine pairing.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

Lately, lower Manhattan seems to be turning into one giant retrofitted clambake. Sun-kissed nostalgia is big at all three spots: aside from the homey names, each traffics in pie à la mode and presents the day’s specials in chalk on a blackboard slate. Redding is said to have spun off after a falling-out, but McFarland doesn’t seem interested in slaying the maritime mother. In fact, his place can suffer from second-generation complacency: when a trio of visitors arrived recently, a host said, “Three is difficult for us.” The inconveniences of the original—an unaccommodating space, harried staff, the absence of overflow seating—are charming, in the way of an old beach house, but feel almost cynical in a new construction.</p><p data-wc="181" word_count="181">When it comes to cooking, however, imitation of one’s elders is a perfectly salubrious, even commendable posture. Ed’s lobster rolls taste a lot like Pearl’s, which is to say, completely delicious. The lobster is chunky, not stringy; the rolls are butter-brushed; balmy mayonnaise is offset by a sprinkling of chives. Shrimp cocktail and oysters on the half shell are classics, thoughtfully prepared. Why McFarland didn’t take equal care with the atmosphere is a mystery. What’s with the random buoy? That the waitresses, in their clamdiggers and halter tops, bring to mind off-duty lifeguards shouldn’t scare one away from the fancier offerings. Montauk bluefish, with Trapani truffle salt, for instance, is accompanied by a slew of woodsy mushrooms and mashed potatoes that possesses a surprising depth of flavor. Something’s lost, though, in a room so loud that a waitress has to confirm an order of whole steamed lobster by holding up her hands and making little pincher motions. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner and Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $15-$26.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

A slim young man, dressed in a sharp suit with his shirt unbuttoned to his solar plexus, strode in, blowing kisses left and right; meanwhile, the sommelier—also cousin to the owner, helmer of the ham-and-cheese station, and sometime manager—instructed a couple of tables on how to drink, Catalan-style, from a two-spouted flask, holding it high and pouring the wine in a thin stream into his mouth. Perhaps overly invigorated by the lesson, one young woman leapt from her table and exhorted the diners at another to try her wine. They politely declined. </p><p data-wc="207" word_count="207">The space—narrow and high-ceilinged, with exposed-brick walls, an elegant mezzanine lined with wine racks, and a tiled partition around the open kitchen—doesn’t exactly dampen the noise, and the Euro-frat-party atmosphere might turn away some diners. But it’s possible to find reasons to enter the fray. The serious missteps—skewers of bitter snails, absent the promised accompaniment of chorizo; tough razor clams that belied the commonly held belief that bacon, here in the form of a vinaigrette, makes anything better—wouldn’t be so disappointing if the kitchen didn’t also demonstrate the ability to turn out precisely executed marvels. Sweetbreads, crisply coated outside and meltingly tender inside, were set on a bed of slightly sweet fennel; a mixed-green salad was tossed with a dressing made of twenty-five-year-old sherry, dried fruit, and nuts, giving it both crunch and tang. A special dish of chickpeas, mixed with blood sausage, apricot, mint, and star anise, seemed like a delicate tribute to Moorish Spain. The inconsistency is pervasive: a server had the lineage of a pig down pat (“This comes from black-footed pigs on the Iberian peninsula, who eat only acorns. You’ll really taste the nutty flavor”) but hesitated over distinguishing Manchego from an Alt Urgell.</p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">The pedigree of Mercat is promising: the owner, Jaime Reixach, is a Barcelona native; his chefs, David Seigal and Ryan Lowder, have experience in the kitchens of both Spain and New York, at Jean Georges. But the impressive credentials didn’t ameliorate the final taste—merely passable <em>churros</em> (it’s hard to foul up sugary fried dough) with a chocolate dipping sauce that had the odd flavor of old leather.

Psilakis, whose restaurant career began thirteen years ago at a T.G.I. Friday’s, opened his first restaurant in the city not quite three years ago. His fourth and latest Manhattan venture, Anthos (Greek for “blossom”), brings what he and his partner, the Apulian-American restaurateur Donatella Arpaia, call first-generation cuisine—traditional offerings in untraditional forms—to its apotheosis.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">There’s lots of fish, much of it, like the meze platter of crudo, adorned with the unexpected—tuna with ruby grapefruit and coriander, yellowtail topped with artichoke and grape leaves, a scallop on the half shell with Mutsu apple and shreds of ramp. <em>Skordalia</em>, a potato-and-garlic purée, has been reinvented as a soup accompanied by batter-fried salt cod (traditional), lightly blanched salt cod (not traditional), and a beet-and-horseradish tartare. A generous portion of pork sits in an avgolemono sauce, alongside dolmas of pork wrapped in cabbage. The trick is to bring agreeable company and to pace yourself—you’ll want to taste just about everything, from the little pot of goat’s-milk butter that comes with the bread (goat butter turns out to be slightly sour, surprisingly mild, and seductively good) right down to the sprig of arugula flowers garnishing the roasted black bass.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">This is food to fuel hedonistic abandon; libations are in order. If you don’t know Cephalonia from Paros, the sommelier, Dana Gaiser, will provide a crash course: Cephalonia’s in the Ionian islands—its wines reflect a strong Venetian influence; Paros is on the other side of the country, in the Aegean. By the second bottle (a Mandilaria-Monemvasia blend from Paros), your dining companion will be boasting of his own Greek lineage (“My family was from Sparta, you know”). Across the way, a vaguely arty group of twenty-somethings (seersucker and T-shirts, mussed hair) loll in grand Dionysian style. Fair warning: ambrosia doesn’t come cheap. At the stroke of midnight, their bill arrives and the revellers’ faces turn gray. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $28-$46.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

For instance, at brunch on a recent Sunday afternoon at Brown Café there was not a blond in sight. Instead, the hip storefront (metal grate still visible, no sign) was filled with hip, hungover customers devouring <em>pain au chocolat</em> and eleven kinds of eggs. They wore sneakers with Velcro, and sunglasses inside; they tended to be of the dark, attractive, bedheaded type. An Italian papa perched his bambino on the back of a Vespa parked outside. The scene was momentarily intimidating. But what if you sat down with the beautiful people and they were really, really nice?</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">“I’d go for the Albariño,” a hostess said, recommending one of the menu’s least expensive bottles of white wine. Her easy sophistication mirrored that of her boss, Alejandro Alcocer, who as a teen-ager left Mexico City, where he was born, to follow the waves. Somewhere along the way, he learned how to cook. Having fallen in with the sort of creative nomads whose line of work necessitates craft services, he opened Green, a largely organic catering business, in 2000. Brown followed, next door. Orange, housed in the same Chinatown compound, is an <em>épicerie</em> that offers mortadella, freshly baked <em>filone</em>, and Catalonian cheeses in a neighborhood where it might be easier to find a live turtle.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">Dinner at Brown is a relaxed, generous affair, one that you might imagine happening on a good night at a great friend’s house. The rustic wooden tables are pocked with knife marks and rings from drinks long drunk. Flank steak—a treat to encounter—is left deliciously pink and served with caramelized shallots, or on pillowy focaccia, as a sandwich. An octopus salad is so fresh as to be almost unadulterated, while the venison loin marinates in “foaming butter,” the smell of which suffuses the entire room. For dessert, there’s apple crisp, drizzled with honey and powdered sugar, and mascarpone, chestnut, and peanut-butter gelato (which even crunches). A blueberry tart is so gorgeous that you hate to touch it. Until you do. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $10-$24.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

There are a couple of award-winning exceptions to the rule (The Grocery and Saul), but other attempts to increase the ambition—and price point—of Smith Street meals have tended to founder. Adam Shepard learned this lesson the hard way: despite encouraging reviews, his Japanese-inspired restaurant, Taku, remained stubbornly empty. </p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">In reconfiguring the place into a low-key but stylish Italian restaurant, Shepard caters to the local tendency to prefer catching a bite. Diners can mix and match the small- or medium-sized plates at will—sitting at the bar with a glass of wine and some cheese or bruschetta (the grilled tomato is the best; all are fiercely garlicky), or opting for more traditionally substantial combinations (panzanella, say, followed by steak grilled with mushrooms). At the finger-food end of things, a dish of fried artichokes is superb: fried more or less to the consistency of potato chips and drizzled with lemon. Of the main courses, a wild bass over grilled leeks is unchallenging but prepared with real care, while the chicken provides unexpected excitement. Its appearance—just a heap of chicken on a plate—leaves you unprepared for the sweet-and-sour intensity of its agrodolce sauce and the detail of its pignoli-and-raisin garnish.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">Occasionally, the limitations of Shepard’s formula are evident. The menu leans heavily toward pasta, but the pastas themselves—fettuccine, linguini, orecchiette—aren’t as impressively flavorful as those at the more old-school Italian haunts in neighboring Carroll Gardens. An emphasis on organic ingredients is praiseworthy, but the menu’s enthusiasm for the “rare breed” pork of Flying Pigs Farm seems overblown. Served with stewed lentils and cabbage, it is hearty, but insufficiently transfigured from plain old pork and beans. Nonetheless, Lunetta seems to have successfully found its audience. Early on, the dining room hums with activity, and, later in the evening, people who look like regulars, or like people who might become regulars, sit on stools near the open kitchen, bantering about their wine choices with the staff.

Synthetic Frenchness comes naturally to him. Now comes Morandi, his attempt at <em>fasullo italiano</em>. Amid all the simulacra—the editions of <em>Corriere della Sera</em> hanging near the door, the rows of Chianti bottles lining the walls—the one key ingredient that seems to be missing is the artful artlessness known as <em>sprezzatura</em>. Contrivance is everywhere. Still, the room’s neo-rustic ambience—low ceilings, lots of distressed wood and brick, plain tables jammed in tight—is alluring, and an agreeable counterpoint to the cheek-to-jowling of the cosmopolitan clientele. It’s the kind of place where you may overhear a slick almost recognizable fellow saying to a young beauty, “I want to go apple picking with you.” So what if it’s April?</p><p data-wc="220" word_count="220">The fare is pan-Italian, your trattorian all-star team. The chef is Jody Williams, formerly of Gusto, around the corner, and she has brought along some of her mainstays, such as lightly fried artichokes, the Sicilian-style meatballs with pine nuts and raisins, and the fried pork-stuffed olives. In the months since Morandi opened, the food, apparently, has improved (a few early reviews were vicious), although now and then something, say, a dry Bolognese sauce, causes one to wonder how to say “Nyeah” in Italian. (Funny, because the restaurant’s namesake, the painter Giorgio Morandi, was from Bologna.) Other dishes, such as a hulking veal chop crusted with prosciutto and Fontina and accompanied by a luscious polenta, may inspire a fervent “<em>Madonna!</em>” There’s a terrific wine list, for Brunello and Barbaresco fanatics, but you can happily get by on the array of house wines that come in carafes. Try not to linger, because in the land of McNally turnover is king. Still, little gestures of generosity abound. If a dirty Martini isn’t dirty enough, the bartender doesn’t just drizzle in a bit more olive juice: he makes a new one from scratch. And if you drop it he won’t make a fuss.

In a restaurant setting, <em>kaiseki</em> has become more elaborate and sensual, but remnants of the ascetic practice remain: delicacy, precision, attention to season. </p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Rosanjin, named after the famed Japanese ceramicist and gourmet Kitaoji Rosanjin, opened its dining room, with just seven tables, in December. (It began offering elegant cedar bento boxes for delivery—including one containing <em>futomaki</em>, a large roll stuffed with toro, squid, sea eel, shrimp, egg, and vegetables—last fall.) As the owner, Jungjin Park, welcomes you to the room—dark wooden tables, spare floral arrangements, a deep-red brocaded-silk wall—he informs you, politely, “<em>Kaiseki</em> is best eaten as it served, so that it doesn’t sit.” In other words, be quiet and eat. </p><p data-wc="238" word_count="238">Each perfectly composed course appears in quick succession: whole, pinkie-finger-size firefly squid, with a dab of buttery egg-yolk vinegar; a cake of minced snapper in <em>wanmori</em>, or fish broth; and <em>mukozuke</em>, several cuts of sashimi, spread out to appear like a chrysanthemum. The sushi course—<em>nakazara</em>—is extraordinary, and Park gently prompts, “When you put the toro in your mouth, place it fish side on the tongue, so it just melts.” He adds, “You can use your fingers, a lot of Japanese do it that way.” Everything is light, crisp, clean—occasionally, as in the case of the <em>hachi</em>, a slim piece of codfish in a slightly gelatinous broth, bland. Then comes the <em>shokuji</em>, slices of rich Wagyu beef and crunchy rice balls, a welcome contrast. (The intimacy of the dining room has another advantage: on subsequent visits, they’ll make sure you aren’t served the same preparations from the ever-changing menu.) Finally, a light, nutty tofu-and-sesame custard, served with fruit, a sliver of housemade chocolate, and a small glass of mango juice: a thoughtful, meditative ending. “People sometimes complain that the dessert isn’t in the French fashion, more elaborate,” Park says, smiling. “But we like to end with something simple, so you don’t forget what you ate before.” (Dining room open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner; delivery Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner. <em>Kaiseki</em> dinner $105 or $150; delivery items $10.50-$60.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

(He proposed the day they closed on the Chelsea storefront.) The beautiful: warmth, heart, light, and a menu and Web site sumptuously wrought in deep purple. The ugly: hit-or-miss flavor and amiable but seriously gawky service. </p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">Things begin pleasingly. Herb butter in a jar. Salty bread. A bar with a homey steel sink and pastel cocktails suggests hospitality, ease. You order starters. Forty-five minutes go by. “There was some sort of malfunction with the machine, and it didn’t get your order.” No problem. The Holunder margarita, with elder-flower essence, has induced spa-worthy levels of relaxation. The Klee salad, when it does arrive, has leaves of Bibb lettuce that look like flower petals. You want to pin it with a blue ribbon. Only when the main courses fail to appear does it become apparent that efficiency isn’t the only thing lacking. While you are waiting—machine again—the man at the next table comes toppling down on top of his stylish but flimsy chair. No one rushes over to help.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">But say, as on another night, that the courses come consecutively, the seats hold up. An Alsatian take on thin-crust pizza, laced liberally with sweet onions, works in a Puckish way, and the Wiener schnitzel delivers. Still, the <em>bacalao</em> croquettes coalesce in a bland mash. The produce here is generally prizewinning, so it’s surprising that a Mason jar of vegetables and spaetzle—a dish that, a waiter declares, Daniel created for Lori—isn’t more impassioned. Accompanying it are test tubes of red-beet powder, artichoke powder, and “an herb infusion.” You find yourself dumping them moodily, like vials of pretty sand.

When the site started up, in 1997, the place was a thirty-five-seat hole in the wall. Chowhounders—who, by disposition, relish a foray into Queens—began posting about it, restaurant reviewers arrived, and soon lots of people were venturing that this might be the best Thai food in the city. Sripraphai quadrupled in size and ditched its fluorescent lighting and Formica tabletops. Nonetheless, between the vertical blinds, the lime-green walls, and the muted TV game show playing in the background, the place hasn’t quite mastered atmosphere—but atmosphere was never the point. On a Saturday night, the crush inside the door always seems to include at least one patron studying the menu with the nervous intensity usually devoted to an exam—pencilling in choices, erasing, and pencilling in some more. </p><p data-wc="181" word_count="181">The hundred-and-twenty-nine-dish menu is long enough to be paralyzing, and can be perilously unpredictable. Request something not too hot, and it may prove spicy enough to trigger not only euphoria but also sweat and tears and intestinal corrosion. Then again, you may wind up with something—green curry, say, or drunken noodles—no spicier than the stuff from your local takeout place. Better to take things as they come. A special northern-Thai-style curry dish combines a fiery red sauce, evocative of Burmese curry, with ground pork, spareribs, and rice noodles; the <em>tom yum</em> pork-leg broth, once you get past the huge, glistening lobes of pork fat, proves to be delicately sour and peppery. The meat salads are so superb, with their interplay of heat and chill, that you might happily construct a whole meal from them. The roasted-duck salad is particularly revelatory, its luscious slices of meat immersed in a riot of flavors, including cilantro, mint, lime juice, and slivers of spicy red peppers. Like the best of Sripraphai’s offerings, it wallops the sweet, peanut-heavy version you’d find elsewhere.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">For dessert, you’re encouraged to choose something to take home out of the refrigerated cases by the front door, where you find, along with various other culinary souvenirs, an array of prepackaged custards, puddings, marzipan, and preserved bananas. With some prodding, the waitress, on a recent evening, eventually produced a bowl of <em>tab tim crob</em>—coconut milk punctuated with ice and jewel-colored tapioca candies, each with a mysterious crunch. “Water chestnuts!” she said, with a wide smile. On second thought, maybe some custard to go. (Open Thursdays through Tuesdays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $7.50-$17.50.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

The bright lights, set in mismatched fixtures, the neon sign in the window, and the takeout service seem to indicate a neighborhood pizza joint, but the relatively high prices—twelve dollars for most of the individual pies—seem more in line with the artisanal aspirations of Franny’s, another lofty-minded pizza place, two blocks over, on Flatbush Avenue. (On the other hand, Amorina also offers a takeout special, listed on a blackboard behind the counter: two slices and a drink for five dollars.) The Italian memorabilia on the walls—vintage ice-cream and soda ads, a map of Umbria and Le Marche, receipts from the café that the grandmother of the owner, Albano Ballerini, operated in Italy—speak of tradition, but the menu includes such unconventional offerings as the Giallorossa, with dried cherries, nutmeg, and crème fraîche.</p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">Ruth Kaplan, the <em>pizzaiola</em>, produces almost perfectly charred and crispy crusts, and creates their toppings with an eye to detail: thinly sliced, almost transparent zucchini laid out like an emerald mosaic and laced with pesto; atop the <em>tricolore</em> pizza, a heap of arugula with a dusting of salt. A Gorgonzola pie with pears and figs was creamy and only slightly sweet, despite a drizzle of dark honey, while a Siciliana pie successfully married the acidic tang of orange slices to lightly caramelized onions and fennel. There are pastas, too, including a meaty, not too saucy lasagna, but they can feel halfhearted, as a tepid spaghetti with calamari and peas did on a recent visit. </p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">Even so, the homey atmosphere—flowery wallpaper, turquoise tiles—makes the little things that are slightly off, like warm wineglasses, seem somehow charming. “We have to store our glassware near the superhot oven,” the waitress explained, gesturing toward the small kitchen. After the last slice of pizza has been devoured (it’s better to be a glutton than to take it home; the crust is better when fresh), there’s a dessert tray to inspect. The tiramisu could be the restaurant’s mascot: it’s humble (served in a tumbler), evocative (the ur-dessert of Italian eateries everywhere), and deliciously idiosyncratic (less ladyfinger, more superbly thick mascarpone).

Falai has a thing for tiny slivers of dried fruit (which he keeps in little plastic boxes, for decoration), and for such arcana as crosnes (a minuscule root), duck tongues, and shavings of <em>bottarga</em> (dried fish roe). Pastas come flavored with chocolate, pear, almond, chestnut; a buffalo-ricotta-and-wild-mushroom flan features a white bloom of creamy cheese on a sweet crust. </p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">Falai is as adept at plain as at fancy. Cockles on linguini come enveloped in a light filigree of foam, but the main pleasure of the dish is the freshness of the pasta itself. Venison comes relatively unadorned, in dapper little rectangles that are tender and salty. Only very occasionally do you feel that Falai’s virtuosity has failed to realize the potential of an ingredient. Monkfish fillets, for instance, are carved into round medallions, as if masquerading as scallops, but lack both savor and succulence. Falai is on surer ground whipping up (literally) <em>merluzzo</em> (flaked cod), mushrooms, and, one suspects, a great deal of oil, a glitzy take on a historically humble dish that he tops off with a few almonds and chickpea crackers. </p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">In keeping with the refinement of the cooking, the small room is tiled and furnished entirely in white, the tables jammed together in a tight line: halfway between a canteen and a laboratory. The place is usually packed, and Falai has opened a more casual venue a block down on Clinton, Falai Panetteria, where the bread for his mini-empire is baked, and another, Caffe Falai, on Lafayette Street, in SoHo. At all the venues, it is crucial to find room for dessert: tiny citrus tarts, semolina tarts, even simple biscotti. Falai’s talent for sweetness seems inexhaustible, and nowhere more so than in the main restaurant’s passion-fruit soufflé, a creation right at the meringue end of the soufflé spectrum—so light that it all but hovers above the plate.

The choice seems only partly propitious. Martin Dressler rises in the world and is fortunate to be able to satisfy “his heart’s desire,” but, as Millhauser writes, “this is a perilous privilege, which the gods watch jealously, waiting for the flaw, the little flaw, that brings everything to ruin, in the end.” Is there a little flaw here? Some Williamsburgers have complained that Dressler is too fancy or too expensive for the neighborhood—strange, if you consider that Peter Luger is across the street. There was also a report that the Dressler rib eye was in fact a strip and that a seviche came out cooked. But nothing so far augurs ruin, except perhaps to Williamsburg’s self-image.</p><p data-wc="220" word_count="220">Dressler is a fine-looking place. Something about the glittering light, the wrought-steel chandeliers, the ornate grillwork, and the sprawling zinc bar contributes to an anachronistic air of haut-boho refinement that one may associate with the beginning of the end in certain now-overrun Manhattan neighborhoods. The chefs, Polo Dobkin and Cal Elliott, who come from the Gramercy Tavern, serve up an array of stalwarts (cod, striper, short rib) without resorting to gimmickry or bombast. The fare is notionally seasonal American, a collection of mostly familiar appropriations, many with a nod to the South. Nothing is dull or outrageous. On a recent evening, a rich allotment of quail and bacon (from “a guy in Tennessee with a couple of pigs,” the waiter said) came atop a bed of luscious grits. Apparently, and unsurprisingly, everyone who works at the place is addicted to them. The skin on the roast chicken is popular, too. Among the appetizers, smoked sturgeon with potato galette and frisée, a cauliflower soup with sautéed bay scallops subbing for croutons, and pea-and-Fontina raviolini in a buttery Parmesan broth inspired repeated sorties from enemy utensils. Maybe the lamb ragout was too salty. If it’s fatal flaws the gods are after, however, they’ll have to keep jealously watching. (Open daily for dinner, Sundays for brunch. Entrées $19-$30.)</p>

Before being reborn, last year, it was a low-key hangout beloved for its high-rolling Connect Four matches. For years, its denizens have reported sightings of an apparition, which, it is said, wears a top hat and causes fireplace logs to ignite spontaneously. In 1958, an ocelot named Lancelot appeared in the dining room, having supposedly jumped out of a nearby window and crawled through the restaurant’s cellar grate.</p><p data-wc="206" word_count="206">Apocrypha abound, as ever—though lately, since the editor in chief of <em>Vanity Fair,</em> Graydon Carter, and several partners took over, they’re of a less hoary variety. Did Ellen Barkin throw a drink at Ron Perelman? Does the truffled mac and cheese really cost fifty-five bucks? The lack of a functional reservations line would suggest that most of us will never get the chance to find out. But one of the place’s pretensions is that it’s anti-pretense; if you want a table, just walk up and ask. (Not that the famous people are subjected to this ritual.) And, so, sprinkled in amongst the fashionable types—on a chilly recent evening, Jann Wenner drank rosé while the Ralph Laurens supped en famille and Mr. Herrera perused his menu by votive-candle light—are tattooed old-timers and true believers who thrill at Carter’s attempts to resurrect the Don’t-I-know-you-from-somewhere city of Mrs. Astor’s Four Hundred and can tick off every last personage depicted in the room’s magnificent mural, by Edward Sorel.

(The last one of note, Roettele A.G., closed a few years ago.) There are certain things that people seem to expect from a Swiss restaurant. Fondue, for starters. Kuettel doesn’t offer it here, although the premises do reek of Gruyère. Second, tidiness. On this count, Trestle doesn’t disappoint, with its uncluttered bar and cozy but spare décor. This being West Chelsea, the bar is crowded with a gaggle of gallery assistants; across the way, a young woman complains about having received a B-plus in Existentialism.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">One also expects a preternatural level of efficiency. And yet, on a recent night, the appetizers didn’t emerge for more than an hour. To help pass the time, something unexpected: Swiss wine. “We have the largest selection of Swiss wines in the city, quite possibly along the Eastern Seaboard,” the manager boasted. “Usually, the Swiss don’t let their wine out of the country. But the owner—he knows people who know people.”</p><p data-wc="202" word_count="202">At last, the food arrived. The platter of cured meats and cheeses was excellent, particularly the paper-thin slices of <em>Bündnerfleisch</em> (air-dried beef), which had a pleasantly pungent flavor. There was a wonderful <em>crépinette</em>—a tight clump of pulled pork shoulder and sautéed onions in a rich, salty sauce—and juicy, tender medallions of lamb. The <em>pizokel</em> (like gnocchi, and sprinkled with Etivaz, a Gruyère-like cheese) made for solid comfort food, and there was plenty of offal to be had: chewy veal kidneys doused in a sauce of Trappist ale, sweetbreads in puff pastry, an oxtail-and-pig’s-foot terrine. But the best that can be said of the rest—the roast pork loin comes to mind—is that it was unobjectionable. It’s not a good sign when your waiter skips over the traditional Swiss <em>Nusstorte</em> and other housemade desserts, rhapsodizing instead about the Ciao Bella vanilla gelato. As Orson Welles’s character observed in “The Third Man,” “In Switzerland they had brotherly love—they had five hundred years of democracy and peace—and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.” (Open Tuesdays through Fridays for lunch and dinner, and weekends—and Mondays, starting Feb. 19—for dinner. Entrées $17.50-$24.50.)</p>

Houston St. 	null	null	null	2007/02/12	<p data-wc="124" word_count="124">The unceasing traffic of Houston Street and the construction pylons and plastic netting along the sidewalk might distract an unwary passerby from this whimsically elegant wine bar and restaurant. But on the other side of the heavy gray drapes that protect the room from winter drafts, all the chaos of the outside world disappears. The white terrazzo marble bar, with comfortable, Art Deco-ish stools, is the centerpiece of the room; gorgeous blown-glass cones hang overhead. Laid out by the design shop Moss—whose owners are partners in the restaurant with Nicola Marzovilla, of I Trulli—the place is an eccentric, vaguely European fantasy: the black-and-white Davies and Starr drawings of oval faces along one wall, the fanciful, elaborate chandeliers, the handsome, slightly aloof waiters.</p><p data-wc="78" word_count="78">As one would expect, great care has been given to the wine list (there’s also an attached wine store, with an almost preposterous chandelier composed of clusters of vividly colored glass grapes). If guidance is required, the bartender might lean in with a few poetic words. “This is a quirky one,” he said one evening, of a Lacrima di Morro d’Alba. “It tastes a bit of berry and florals, and opens up into a cherry.” Sold.</p><p data-wc="160" word_count="160">For a light dinner, or a late-night snack, there’s much on the menu to be savored. <em>Bignè</em>, puffy balls of fried dough, contained an infusion of salami and Pecorino; a mâche salad was topped with parsnip chips that added a perfect crunch. The pastas, given a pedigree at the bottom of the menu—Marzovilla’s mother, Addolorata, makes them by hand—mostly delivered; the maccheroncini had a nicely sea-soned Bolognese sauce enlivened with crisp little peas. The main courses tend to be less successful. A recent offering of venison was oversalted, though the meat underneath the saline crust had a delicately gamy tang. Veal cheeks, remarkably tender, were bland. A too tomatoey caponatina still outperformed the somewhat limp piece of bass it accompanied. But the steamed chocolate pudding, rich and creamy, smoothed away all the rough patches, and one felt almost ready to head back out into the world. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

So it was with ado that the chowing classes anticipated the opening of Kampuchea. Focussing on Cambodian regional specialties, the restaurant—from the former Fleur de Sel manager Ratha Chau—had become, as one food blog noted in November, “the focus of many a bleeding-edge eater.” Gawker predicted, “This soup stand will be the new hotness.”</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">At first glance, the place does possess a certain warmth. Copper pots hang, Julia Child-style, from the ceiling of an open kitchen; a waiter (perhaps a touch too intimately) works the room with a tank top over his T-shirt, which is kind of like wearing your blouse under your bra. His colleague sportingly plays along when a boisterous foursome, seated next to a man in a wool sweater patterned after a Budweiser label, subjects him to a game of Name That Movie Line. (Line: “I’m a fiend for mojitos!” Movie: “Miami Vice.”) The mojito in question contains not just mint but coconut; the Martini, lychee; the margarita, blackberries that turn out pink. The cocktails are a bright spot, although it’s hard to squelch a vision of Carmen Miranda’s turban going into the blender.</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">Once the grilled cuttlefish (squishy, fishy) and the sweet-chili corn (passable, but with a cloying coconut mayo) arrive, a suspicion arises: the drinks were just a distraction ploy, the rainbow in a vast flavorless sky. According to a note at the top of the menu, its offerings are a “tribute to street food,” but, for zest and even thoughtfulness, the pretzel cart wins. Of the noodle soups, <em>phom penh katiev</em> has all the nuance of a vat of duck sauce, while the chicken <em>katiev</em>—aromatic, gingery, and with a bit of kick—begins to feel exceptional, but only in its decentness. Most satisfying is a sandwich of skirt steak piled onto buttery French bread, though the promised heat—this time, in the form of sambal chili—seems, typically, nowhere in evidence.

They have produced a brasserie that seems—from the pressed-tin ceiling to the tea-towel napkins—so generic that you start to suspect some sort of sophisticated in-joke. The venue is perfectly pitched to a late-twenties crowd that seems as standardized as the setting. He: financial services, gym, bed head, shirt undone to second button, a beer, steak frites. She: publicity, tanning bed, “blond,” chunky belt slung to one side, specialty cocktail, chicken salad.</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">Up to a point, it doesn’t matter much what the cooking is like. Certainly, if you order one of the obvious standards of the bistro menu, you can get the boring dish you deserve. The steak frites is on the stringy side, the mussels decent but average, and the filet-mignon dish spoils a nice cut of meat with a needless dollop of blue cheese. The surprise comes in the fact that the chef, Lonnie (“I haven’t asked his second name,” a waiter said. “He scares me.”), is capable of real excellence, with some well-executed dishes tucked into corners of the menu where they won’t be noticed. A pork chop, thick and laden with caramelized onions and cabbage, has a deep, rich taste that makes you think of berries. A skate fillet, nicely offset by maitake mushrooms and barely sautéed Brussels sprouts, comes on a base of cauliflower whipped to a gel-like consistency. The desserts, though, are underwhelming, with pastry crusts the texture of flowerpots. And even some of the better options—a squash-soup special, say—stick, not very inventively, to the sweet end of the taste spectrum.</p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">The Martignetti brothers have opened a bar and lounge named Belgrade beneath the restaurant, which means that the sceney aspect of the experience will only get worse. It’s best to come early and have a really good meal when the place is empty. By midnight or so, there is a fine postcollegiate hum of people snapping each other with camera phones and texting friends. It’s the sort of atmosphere where the following exchange is possible. Waiter: “How were your frites, on a scale of one to ten?” Dude: “Awesome!”(Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $14-$29.)</p>

First came BLT Steak, then BLT Fish, then BLT Prime, and last year we got the most unlikely offshoot of all: all-beef patties via a chef trained by Claude Troisgros and Joël Robuchon.</p><p data-wc="162" word_count="162">Burgers, timeless as they may be, are the restaurant raison d’être du jour, as though space aliens, or Frenchmen, have concluded that the best way to colonize us is by cloning burger joints. Cinematic law dictates that there must always be a wrong note or two, a seam in the matrix, that gives away the contrivance, and at BLT Burger there are several: the ladies’ room is stocked with unbeefy lit (“Cathy Uncovers a Secret,” “The Gender Bias Prevention Book”); the music repeats itself (Frampton comes alive more than once an hour); and the menu offers spiked milkshakes, such as the Master Blaster, which consists of strawberry ice cream, coconut milk, and Mount Gay rum (you can be sure that Arthur Fonzarelli never ordered one at Al’s). But authenticity may be overrated, and, anyway, BLT Burger gets the formula mostly right—chrome napkin dispensers, a giant Gulf Oil sign, and well-proportioned burgers served a certain way, unless you insist otherwise.</p><p data-wc="166" word_count="166">That way is medium rare/medium (which can apparently also mean well done or hardly done at all), fixed with mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, onions, and L. and T. The buns are blessedly soft, plain, and white—no focaccia trickery. The patties are five ounces of Black Angus beef at the low end of the salt and fat range, which likely costs them a medal in the best-burger sweepstakes. There are salutary deviations, such as an ahi-tuna burger, dressed with spicy harissa mayo, which tastes a little like a margarita, and a lamb-merguez burger, which comes with cucumbers and yogurt sauce and is agreeably funky. A scouting party recently concluded that it would be wrong even to try the veggie burger or the Japanese Kobe burger, which costs $62, but, with regard to the spiked shakes, curiosity prevailed, and the consensus was that the Grandma’s Treat—made with bourbon, naturally—was the least baked Alaska of the lot.

The space is much smaller, but the fare is about what you’d find at the other two restaurants, and that linkage, apparently, is more than enough of a draw: Cluny opened its doors in October and was quickly overrun.</p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">Appropriately, the décor is all about pedigrees and taxonomies, both zoological and anthropological. The walls are adorned with mounted butterflies and a rather unsettling array of stuffed birds and fish. Juxtaposed with the taxidermic displays are portraits of various West Village neighbors who are friendly with the management—among them Diane von Furstenberg, Ian Schrager, and Wagenknecht’s ex-husband, the restaurateur Keith McNally. The rest of the setup—the clunky wineglasses, the uncomfortable café-style chairs, the cute waitresses in striped T-shirts—feels slightly overstudied in its simplicity.</p><p data-wc="209" word_count="209">The menu isn’t so much well edited as abridged. Here’s the requisite beet-and-goat-cheese salad, there’s the roasted chicken, and there, of course, are the steak frites. It’s all well executed (with the exception of some soggy fries), but somehow it feels lazy. It’s also very rich, from the lardons festooning the thickly oiled frisée salads to the seared foie gras splayed over the short ribs. Food like this wants to be eaten slowly and savored, but the dishes come out very fast, and you can’t quite keep up with the conveyor belt. By the time Al Green’s “Tired of Being Alone” plays for the second time, you’re past tired, and approaching glutted. Fortunately, the desserts are a high point: the ginger-yogurt cheesecake with mint offers a welcome jolt of flavor, and the profiteroles—ice cream stuffed inside perfectly crisp puffs of pastry—are good enough to inspire momentary infatuation with the place. A pity, then, that your plate is whisked away before you’ve finished. “The next reservation has actually arrived,” the hostess explains, in a stage whisper. “Didn’t they tell you that we’d need the table back?” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Its inviting atmosphere—French windows frosted in a lacy pattern, cream walls and a copper-colored tin ceiling—make the food seem almost beside the point, although the menu itself is something of a novelty for the neighborhood, leaning as it does on Louisiana home-style cooking (the restaurant’s name stands for “North of New Orleans”). There is plenty of Big Easy memorabilia on the walls: an autographed photo of Paul Prudhomme, photos of the French Quarter.</p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">The chef and co-owner, Gregory Tatis, trained at Prudhomme’s famed restaurant K-Paul (and went on to cook at New York’s Delta Grill), and the influence shows. Asked for recommendations, the friendly waiter first extolled the blackened filet mignon, which, he explained, is “seared on the outside, so the meat almost boils itself,” and went on to praise the catfish. “I’m from a fishing town,” he said, “and the chef really does a remarkable job with this fish.” Both turned out to be quite good, if not exactly phenomenal: the steak was tender, with a terrific bacon-and-onion demi-glace; the catfish was enlivened by its accompaniment of andouille and crawfish. It seemed that the meatier the offering, the better: the chicken-pork-and-tasso-ham jambalaya was perfect comfort food on a winter evening, and the superb alligator sausage was salty, spicy, and juicy. Less successful was the smoked-duck-and-crackling gumbo, which was tepid and weirdly tinny; a waiter eyed the barely touched cup and offered to take it off the bill (but didn’t). And when it came time for dessert, the chocolate-orange mousse cake tasted like something out of a Whitman’s sampler.</p><p data-wc="68" word_count="68">Despite these missteps, NoNO Kitchen seems to be living up to the anticipation. At heart, this is the best type of local joint—ambitious, but responsive to the crowd. “We’re still feeling out the neighborhood,” Tatis, who lives nearby, said. “We’re really trying to cater to them, while keeping our roots with New Orleans.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner, weekends for brunch.

Never has this seemed more the case than this year, when Gerald Lieblich rescued the deed from the United States Golf Association and pledged to restore the restaurant to its “Tootsie”-era primacy. His incarnation, the Tea Room’s fourth since 1926, opened in November, and it leaves intact, more or less, Warner LeRoy’s thirty-six-million-dollar tsarist wonderland from 1999. A liveried attendant continues to whirl the revolving door; the burnished antique samovars stay, as do veal Pojarski and chicken Kiev (albeit in fine print on the menu’s last page). The only thing Lieblich forgot to take out of the attic, it appears, is a sense of grand occasion.</p><p data-wc="213" word_count="213">Everybody’s rooting for the place. “Is that a Picasso?” a tourist asked the other evening, eager to imbue with further meaning a painting, hanging near the elevator, of a horse rider playing a mandolin. A few days later, at lunch, the <em>Post</em> columnist Cindy Adams—a faithful during the regime of longtime owner Faith Stewart-Gordon—was back giving the old hangout a fresh shot. The problem is not the food, which runs from serviceable (molasses-glazed seared breast of duck, venison dusted with cocoa) to forgettably enjoyable (short-rib borscht, the famous beef Stroganoff). <em>Zakuski</em>—a selection of Russian appetizers—sounded fun, and might have been, had the waiter bothered to explain, after delivering a lovely étagère, what it held. Likewise: a bowl of soup took thirty-five minutes to arrive; a waiter knocked a wine list off a table and didn’t pick it up. It’s not surliness, exactly, but apathy that’s killing the room. As a Texan visitor put it recently, “The service here doesn’t know diddly-squat.” Cindy Adams concurred, writing in her column that the management had failed to recognize who she was. Unless the mood rises to the setting, the Russian Tea Room may not get another chance. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $32-$48.)</p>

At Boqueria, a new tapas bar in Chelsea named after Barcelona’s food market, the sense of informality is enhanced by a long communal table that dominates the dining room and by the fact that all the seats are barstool height. The result is a convivial room, almost always populated by a thirty-something crowd.</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">The menu delivers some familiar favorites with original touches. A brandade of potato and salt cod is as creamy and comforting as one would expect, but toasted breadcrumbs and crispy arugula give it a crunch like that of Japanese deep-fried seaweed. Shrimp fried in oil, fiercely flavored with garlic and guindilla peppers, are most notable for the delicacy with which they are cooked—not a second too long, so that each one bursts in the mouth. The deep, vinegary tang of a lentil stew is heightened with ingeniously thin round crisps of Serrano ham—porcine Communion wafers—and poached egg. Even the simplest Catalan dish of all, oiled bread scraped with garlic and tomato, is prepared with obvious care.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">Not everything is a success. One recent evening, an insipid special of snapper fillet, on a bed of watery vegetable strips, suggested that maybe it’s best to stick to the canonical offerings. Paella proved similarly underwhelming, as a good deal of the rice was welded to the inside of the pan. But another rice dish, the risotto-like <em>arroz cremoso</em>, was a successful innovation, its base flavors of salt cod, mussel broth, and Manchego sweetened by a very unexpected, and un-Spanish, ingredient: lychees.</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">The sheer popularity of the place means that it can be lively to the point of insanity. (Reservations are not accepted, and there is little room in which to wait.) Furthermore, the high chairs have the same effect as a low ceiling, subjecting diners to noise levels sufficient to provoke deep animal panic. Eying a long tiled wall, one felt that it might be an idea to swathe it—and possibly some of the guests—in carpeting. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dishes $6-$26.)</p>

He’s a creation of two Israeli marketers, Max Fichtman and Oded Brenner, who opened a chocolate shop in Raanana ten years ago. Still, Oded Brenner, who is, in fact, bald, has assumed the role (Fichtman is no longer involved), and, in pursuit of global choco-domination, he has issued a slew of grandiose pronouncements about his “chocolate love story” and his mission to create “a new chocolate culture.” Did the founders of Friendly’s make such claims for their ice cream? </p><p data-wc="274" word_count="274">The Union Square franchise, which has been open for six months (a new outlet opened last week in the East Village), would seem to be a chocoholic’s dream, cluttered with vats of molten chocolate, clear apothecary flasks of what appear to be cocoa powders and spices, and brown pipes overhead, which, despite signs indicating otherwise, are almost certainly not full of the stuff. A menu full of glistening photographs offers chocolate in many guises. (There is also regular food—oily <em>croques-madames</em>, hulking crêpes, omelettes as big as handbags—that should be summoned from the kitchen only if you have meal guilt to assuage or kids to nourish.) There are half a dozen hot-cocoa varieties, a chocolate fondue, a giant syringe full of chocolate, and a sliced bagel with a chocolate bar and praline sandwiched in between. The “individual mess,” a heap of chocolate chunks, cake, and sauce, with ice cream, whipped cream, toffee cream, sprinkles, et al., comes in a bowl big enough for a Great Dane and may cause even the most sweet-toothed or stoned diner to pine for a daintier portion, or a potato chip. On a recent visit, a usually undiscerning choco-fiend tried the melted milk chocolate into which one dips vanilla ice-cream bars. “It tastes like melted Easter bunnies,” she said, frowning. A bite of chocolate pizza—milk and white chocolate and marshmallow on a pizza crust—inspired a grimace from another diner. As he declared that purgation was imminent, a waitress came by. “Would you like a Coke?” she said, holding out an unsolicited tankard. No thanks. Really. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Amezcua’s guacamole, it should be said, is not only traditional, it is excellent: tart (plenty of lime juice), with generous amounts of cilantro and chopped jalapeños. Still, so many people have grown accustomed to guacamole tasting of garlic that the question has become a sore one. (Amezcua was recently coerced into an informal “guac-off,” which he lost; his opponent resorted to garlic.)</p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">Much of the best food here is built around chiles: from the chile relleno (a gorgeous, slightly smoky poblano stuffed with squash) to the <em>budín al pasilla</em> (a casserole of chicken and pasilla chiles) to the lamb (ribs rubbed with ancho chiles, with caramelized apples and sweet potatoes on the side). There are also some successful nods to street food, like the quesadillas, dense, thick pockets of fresh masa, stuffed with a variety of savory fillings. The simple desserts have some interesting touches, like the hunk of <em>palanqueta</em>—a traditional pecan brittle with a fudgelike consistency—garnishing the dulce-de-leche ice cream.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">Although Amezcua was schooled in classic French cooking and has worked as a chef in New York for the past fifteen years (Savoy, Il Buco), this is his effort to provide something homier—something evocative of how you’d be received in someone’s house in Mexico City, where he is from. The operation feels very much like a family affair (Amezcua’s wife, Debby, co-manages the restaurant and helps out with the cooking; the photographs of Tulum and the traditional Mexican masks that adorn the walls are on loan from his brother). The bartender is from Coyoacán, Amezcua’s old neighborhood in Mexico City, and patrons can often be found at the bar speaking Spanish and slowly sipping tequila. The tequila list, which is much longer than the wine list, ranges from young <em>blancos</em> to <em>reposados</em> (aged several months) to <em>añejos</em> (aged over a year). “When someone is drinking just the Cuervo,” the bartender said one recent rainy night, as a <em>huapango</em> trio played traditional music from Veracruz, “I know that something must be wrong.” (Open Tuesdays through Fridays for dinner, weekends for brunch and dinner.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/11/27/bridge-cafe	BRIDGE CAFÉ	279 Water St., at Dover St. 	null	null	null	2006/11/27	<p data-wc="134" word_count="134">This restaurant, housed in a red painted wooden building in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, has a lively history: the structure dates from as early as 1794, five prostitutes registered their occupancy of the third floor during the census of 1855, and the bar has served beer to fishmongers, pirates, snitches, and newspapermen, even through Prohibition. Adam Weprin, whose family owns the restaurant, says the place also plays host to poltergeists: disembodied footsteps treading the floors, impertinent spectral presences felt in both the men’s and the ladies’ rooms, and spooky whispers in one’s ear. According to exhaustive research conducted by Richard McDermott, a retired science teacher and freelance historian, the Bridge Café should be considered the city’s oldest drinking establishment. (McDermott, unsurprisingly, is not entirely welcome at McSorley’s Old Ale House.)</p><p data-wc="78" word_count="78">When the Weprin family took over, in 1979, they renovated the restaurant but retained the dining room’s nineteen-twenties lineaments—a low, pressed-tin ceiling, white wainscot walls, and a wooden bar running its length. The Wep-rins also tried to keep some of the local color by charging the bookies, who had long been regulars, pre-upgrade prices. The illicit company never seemed to bother another frequent visitor, Ed Koch, who ate there at least twice a week during his mayoralty. </p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">It’s easy to see what kept them all coming back. The food here is given haute-cuisine billing (the lamb chops come in a “cabernet and fresh herb reduction”), but what arrives on the plate is pure heartland, from the generous portions to the profligate use of butter. A crab-artichoke-and-spinach fondue was meaty and rich. Goat cheese somewhat overwhelmed the autumn-vegetable strata, but the smoked-gouda-and-pine-nut crust on the chicken was nicely understated. Pounded flat and fried, the fowl was juicy and crisp, though nearly outshone by its side dish of creamy mashed potatoes. Fortunately, you probably won’t have room for dessert: a wedge of pumpkin pie looked and tasted rather wan, with a pallid crust. A glass of Muscat De Frontignan might be a better choice for those waiting around for the ghosts to emerge. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner, Sundays for brunch and dinner.

Zucco, the wiry and goateed owner, might size you up (girth plays a factor) and ask a couple at the bar to slide over and open up a space. There’s room here for about twenty (there are three small tables), and the tight quarters force a sense of camaraderie: anytime a guest needs to walk toward the back, to the rest room, patrons along the bar cheerfully lean forward to make way. </p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">But it’s more than just the lack of space that makes the place feel so intimate—it’s the charming clutter of Parisian signs and Polaroids of hip-looking young men and women stuck in the chandelier and in the corners of mirrors hung on the wall; the agreeably dim lighting; and the music playing just a little too loud, as if your bratty teen-age brother had taken control of the family stereo. And of course there is Zucco himself, who might shake his finger chidingly at a late dinner companion and who greets his regulars with a kiss on the cheek. </p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">The menu leans heavily on Continental comfort food—steak with peppercorn sauce; the “French burger baguette,” with crisp fries; a croque monsieur—but is also wide-ranging, with a simple and rich <em>gratinée à l’oignon</em> (French onion soup) on the same page as the “cassoulet de Castelnaudary,” which features duck confit, two types of sausage, and beans. Perhaps the most theatrical are the <em>moules du jour,</em> which are poured with a clatter into a generous white bowl and offered up steaming. </p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">Most things, though, tend to the <em>petit</em>, including the wine, which is served in half-size wineglasses and priced accordingly. It can be hard for some to adjust: one recent evening, a neighboring diner was asked to evaluate the lamb chop he was eating. “It’s very tasty,” he said, but added, casting a nervous glance at Zucco across the bar and lowering his voice, “It’s kind of small.” Somehow, it seems unlikely that Zucco would be offended.

Surely those two handsome men, huddled over a scrap of paper at the end of the bar, are plotting a wine-tasting route from Montepulciano to Pienza or debating the finer points of grandmother’s <em>ragù</em> recipe. Further investigation reveals a receipt from Staples; they’re talking about printer paper. But doesn’t everything sound romantic in the language of Fellini and opera?</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">The culinary corollary, and Bellavitae’s founding precept, is that things taste better because they’re from Italy. And so the menu teems with meticulously sourced native delicacies—Campanese mozzarella di bufala; prosciutto di Parma Langhirano “Gran Riserva” D.O.P.; chestnut honey from Lake Como that Cristiano, the Roman-born manager, says “really takes me back in time”—and the all-<em>paesano</em> wine list concentrates on small indigenous vineyards. The vinegar is balsamic, aged twelve years, and the delicious suckling pig is prepared “in the style of the Pianella Fair in Abruzzo.” Even the lettuce is flown in from the homeland. “We’re not inventing anything here, just presenting the best ingredients,” Cristiano said. The restaurant doubles as a commissary, and many of the dry goods are available for purchase, as Cristiano explained, “so that you can give it a shot at home.”</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">In keeping with these gentle aims, the guiding service principle seems to be unobtrusiveness—no accordions here, and amen—though a server, the other night, tried to upsell a viticulturally challenged table, which was a disappointment. If you’re looking for company, try the back-room bar, where a sous-chef assembles cold plates with the seriousness of a surgeon while everyone else has a lot of fun watching. At dinnertime recently, a teen-age couple had trouble with eye contact during the crostini course, relaxed over spaghetti <em>cacio e pepe</em>, and, by gelato time, were sharing a spoon.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/11/06/latelier-de-joel-robuchon	L’ATELIER DE JOËL ROBUCHON	57 E. 57th St. 	40.623979	-73.9206249	212-350-6658	2006/11/06	<p data-wc="134" word_count="134">Few cities pride themselves on sophisticated luxury as much as Paris and New York, and when famous French chefs cross the Atlantic the result is often an uneasy face-off. A Michelin three-star chef, Joël Robuchon might expect to fare better: after his sudden retirement, a decade ago, his comeback, in 2003, with the first Atelier, was a bit of a revolution in the conservative context of Parisian dining. It didn’t take reservations, and its customers were seated at a counter facing the kitchen. Following branches in Las Vegas and Tokyo (another one opened in London, in September), the iteration at the Four Seasons hotel has tables as well as the counter seating; the center of the restaurant is a black marble kitchen, largely for show—there is an ordinary-looking kitchen at the back.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">At its best, Robuchon’s food has the air of a miracle, albeit a carefully engineered one. Sea urchin comes in a lobster gelée that is topped with cauliflower-infused cream and dotted with parsley purée, placed like numbers on a clock. It is served in a clear bubble, making it look like something Barbarella might eat. But beyond all the madly intensive labor of the dish’s presentation the gravity-defying effects of the jelly enhance the strange, delicate texture of the urchin. There are other similarly small, striking dishes on the menu, but not everything is quite so impressive. A langoustine in a fritter of remarkable lightness was served with a lacklustre basil dipping sauce, and duck breast stuffed with foie gras, though rich and satisfying, was rather pedestrian. </p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">The staff is so friendly that it seems churlish to point out that they’re not always very knowledgeable about the menu, and inquiries after your happiness can’t mask the fact that the wait between dishes is highly variable. And it’s odd, having been refused a dinner reservation before half past ten, to arrive in a restaurant that’s barely more than half full, and odder still to be told, one night, that the kitchen closes at eleven, only to see guests being seated well after that a couple of nights later. Of course, caprice at the reservations desk can do much for the mystique of a restaurant—there’s a masochistic kick in being snubbed—but this smacked of chaos, which is far less sexy.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/30/cafe-dalsace	CAFÉ D’ALSACE	1695 Second Ave., at 88th St. 	null	null	null	2006/10/30	<p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Simon Oren, the owner of Nice Matin and Marseille, is the Dave Thomas of the New York bistro revival: not the originator (Keith McNally would be our Ray Kroc) but a distinguished and thriving practitioner all the same. The Upper East Side got a branch last spring. By night, Café d’Alsace is a clamorous brasserie, the unsightly acoustic tile on the ceiling doing little to muffle the treble din; by day, the atmosphere is dawdling and subdued. It’s not as cozy as Café Luxembourg or as grandiose as Balthazar, but, in such close proximity to the likes of Elaine’s and Pat O’Brien’s, it fills the Francophile slot authentically enough to summon thoughts, if not visions, of the Maginot Line. </p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">Although the place ably serves up the standards, steak frites and the rest, the innovation, for Yorkville anyway, is the array of heartier Alsatian offerings, many of which arrive in black cast-iron pots, like something a farm girl might sneak to a wounded soldier hiding out in the barn. (You also get Rambo-sized steak knives, in case the enemy stumbles in.) The <em>baeckeofe</em>, a traditional Alsatian lamb-and-oxtail casserole, is more than fortifying, especially if you’ve started out with a sausage plate or a preliminary hunk of bone marrow, which comes with toasted country bread and a bowl of salt. The lamb shanks, braised in beer, may cleave delicately off their bones, but they will likely stick to yours. (The spaetzle is the spackle.) Even the fish has heft: the resemblance, in texture and color, of the creamy pike mousse to gefilte fish does not detract from its heartwarming (and heart-stopping) savoriness.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Much has been made of the fact that Café d’Alsace has a beer sommelier. The place has more than a hundred and ten varieties, and even the most expensive ones won’t hit the bottom line as hard as a Châteauneuf du Pape. There’s a Chimay Bleu, Grand Reserve, at about a buck an ounce. The waitress holds the label out for all to see, pops the cork, pours out a taste, then waits for the verdict. You may linger a moment, savoring the chance to send back a beer. “It has never happened,” the waitress says, and why would it? (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $15.75-$25.75.)</p>

The new dining room and bar seat ninety and are already filled with very earnest foodies—the kind who greet anyone unwitting enough to order something as banal as a cosmopolitan with curious, sidelong glances. (With the juice squeezed to order, cranberries would be tricky; also, it’s not that sort of place.) </p><p data-wc="205" word_count="205">This is greenmarket cooking at its most improvisational. Colin Alevras, the chef and co-owner, builds each day’s menu around what he finds at a farmer’s market that morning. Should he determine that mushrooms are the thing, as he did on a recent Wednesday, he doesn’t hold back: that night, four of seven starters and six of eight main dishes were built around them. (There was even fungus as dessert: club coral mushrooms with sheep’s-milk yogurt, honey, and bee pollen.) If there is something manic about the menu planning, there is something equally fleeting about the results, and a particular dish may never reappear. In some cases, this is a blessing: a pile of raw matsutake-mushroom slices drizzled with “cheese-pumpkin juice” was earthy and dull. But other inventions succeed: a bistro-style offering of porcini topped with a fried egg and crispy pork skin was richly satisfying, and braised Montauk bluefish, served with an eggplant <em>romesco</em> sauce and crunchy slivers of crimson okra, was a triumph of contrasting textures. The dishes come in either “taste” (appetizer-size) or “share” (entrée-size) portions; tastes are the way to go. (One caveat: when your server suggests “coursing out” the tastes, it’ll take a few hours.)</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">Colin’s wife and co-owner, Renée, works the crowd most nights, discussing the food and especially the wine at great length. (The three-hundred-odd-bottle list is devoted to small American producers.) “That wine has a lot of gumption,” she announced the other night, describing a Syrah from Knights Valley. So far, the food hasn’t diverged wildly from that of the old space, but Renée seems downright giddy about the possibilities. “This week, we handled the meat from a whole cow,” she said. “We’ve always dealt with smaller beasts, smaller ovens, smaller storage areas.” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

But there’s little at Momofuku Noodle Bar, other than the basic ingredient, to suggest a deeper correspondence; Chang gives the name only its literal definition on his Web site: “lucky peach.” In some ways, despite the utter absence of noodles, Momofuku Ssäm Bar, at least in its daytime hours, seems to more closely bear out the analogy—it’s fast, the food leaves a sodium slick on the tongue, and there’s a certain retro charm to its budget pretensions (plastic sporks and already worse-for-wear metal trays). But it’s not actually cheap, and therein lies the problem: who wants to spend nine bucks on a glorified burrito bar?</p><p data-wc="193" word_count="193">Many people do, apparently. One recent dinner hour, there was a steady, if not bustling, line at the counter, where two seemingly dispirited workers glumly assembled the three items on the menu—the <em>ssäm</em> (a flour pancake filled with meat or tofu, rice, beans, Kewpie slaw, and a kimchi purée), a rice bowl of similar ingredients, and steamed buns. Late nights, though, are when this place serves the upmarket food that better suits its sleekly modern interior. Chang enlisted Joaquin Baca, his co-chef and co-owner from Noodle Bar, and various chef friends for the kitchen, and Chang himself can sometimes be seen slicing thin strips of fatty ham and cutting open oysters. The menu warns, “We do not serve vegetarian friendly items,” and, one recent night, there was a suitably eclectic selection of meats—spicy tripe, a warm, rich veal-head terrine, a delicious pork-sausage corn dog. (Even so, there was also a crisp salad of pickled wax beans and purslane.) Servers are friendly, if occasionally presumptuous—“We’ve got something fizzy for you,” a waiter offered a female diner one evening, pointing to the sparkling wine, “and a beer for him.” </p><p data-wc="65" word_count="65">Chang has never taken himself, or at least his restaurants, too seriously—at Noodle Bar, he’s been known to post “Momofuku’s Overrated and Overpriced!” on the door. Maybe, at Ssäm Bar, he’ll ditch the daytime shtick and quit telling the same old joke.

Given the term’s scuzzy connotations, it’s curious that Allison Vines-Rushing and Slade Rushing—who commute between New York and Louisiana—have chosen it to christen a takeout counter devoted to, as the menu declares, “healthy, organic, seasonal ingredients.” Here, the filth is family-friendly (dirty rice, an old Southern recipe that calls for giblets, comes in a blessedly gizzardless version) and the bird is free-range. Buttermilk-dipped or slow-roasted, this is virtuous chicken.</p><p data-wc="238" word_count="238">But, however lofty its aspirations, a New York City to-go joint must adhere to certain conventions. These include unhurried storefront service (you wonder if the fowl is not only hormone-free but hand-plucked) and a range of options (preparation, piece count, sauce, meat shade) sufficiently broad to confound even the cheeriest home-ec major. The tiny space offers a few seats, but you’d be crazy to want to eat there. (The place is almost right on top of a subway entrance, for one thing.) Smart folk plot their meals in peace—dividing and conquering the uniformly delicious sides—and call up for delivery. Within twenty minutes, a man in a bright-orange shirt arrives bearing a sack of succulent, spicy legs and thighs, soaking through their cardboard cartons. Rotisserie trumps fried or fingers; a whole, likewise, is preferable to a half or a quarter. The shallot corn bread may be soggy, but the kale is lush and redeemed from benign worthiness by dustings of red-pepper flakes and garlic. Mac and cheese (elbows, not shells) has a sweet fondue taste; Jojo’s slow-roasted potatoes are perfectly browned and flecked with chives. There are even freshly baked cookies, and cold, fizzy bottles of Abita root beer. Order in a mess of their food next time you have people over, and try not to feel bad about being unable to cook anything this good. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $5.99-$20.99.)</p>

The walls are riveted steel, the wood booths and tables are dark and sleek, and on one wall a cutout square of plaster reveals brick, hung with rusty saw blades. Behind the bar, twin TV monitors play an endless video loop of either surfing or skateboarding. Diners are sometimes outnumbered by drinkers, drawn to the nearly at-cost wine and concoctions like the Spicy Corona, a mixture of beer, tequila, lime, and hot sauce (“That one can be lethal,” a waiter warned). In the clientele, at least, there seems to be some correspondence to the South Fork: most, with sweaters thrown over shoulders and popped polo collars, look like they might have a summer share in the Hamptons. </p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">Ditch Plains got off to a slightly rocky start—complaints ranged from the lack of bellies in the fried clams to the stemless wineglasses—and it seemed like this could be the sophomore slump for Marc Murphy and Pamela Schein Murphy, who also own the reliably excellent Landmarc, in Tribeca. Then the Murphys wisely dropped the restaurant’s prices and came to terms with its modest mission: pleasing but plain Americana. There’s certainly satisfaction to be found in a juicy burger accompanied by vinegary pickles, or the thick, salty crab dip. And there are some surprises on the menu, like the spicy, crisply fresh fried-calamari salad. Breakfast—omelettes, egg sandwiches, and bagels with smoked salmon—is served all day. Slices of pie, from the Little Pie Company, come to the table with a can of store-bought whipped cream: tongue-in-cheek supermarket cuisine run amok. </p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">The service here is sweet, if sometimes scattered—one night, a neighboring table had to pass over a diner’s credit card after it was dropped off there by mistake. But the staff is also willing to entertain the peculiar cravings that food from one’s childhood sometimes elicits. On a recent evening, a waiter managed to keep a straight face at an off-the-menu request for a meal of macaroni and cheese (which was dense and creamy, with a nice crust on top), accompanied by a hot dog—no bun, no fries. Not a problem. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $5-$24.)</p>

This is not one of those restaurants with a templelike calm. It’s more in the style, one customer said, of the places that surround Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market—serving superlative fish in a rough-and-ready manner. Kuribara and his two assistants banter with the diners along the bar, the menu looks as if it had been through a wash cycle folded up in someone’s back pocket, and a notice at the entrance tells ignorant Westerners not to rub their chopsticks together or dunk wasabi in the soy sauce. </p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">Probably the best way to experience the place is to sit at the counter and order the <em>omakase</em>, allowing Kuribara to decide what cuts of fish to serve. The quality of the fish, if not quite on the level of midtown’s pricier sushi palaces, is impressive, as is the variety. Curiosities here include saury, halfbeak, and sweetfish—a Japanese freshwater species that is sardinelike in appearance but almost fruity in taste. There is also the alarmingly named “live shrimp.” Only the head is served, but a waitress said that shrimp remain alive for a few minutes after decapitation. It’s not clear that the final flickerings of a crustacean consciousness really add much to the experience, but Kuribara seems to have quite a thing for shrimp heads. Even an apparently innocuous miso soup had one bobbing cheekily to the surface.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Other surprises on the menu include <em>chawan mushi</em>—a small pot of steamed egg custard, salty and creamy, containing ginkgo nut, honeywort, and fish—and flaming <em>turban shell</em>, inverted to become its own cauldron. It tends to run out quite early in the evening, because the restaurant, which has been open a little more than a year, has a loyal following among Japanese and Japanophile customers, who throng the bar most nights and fall upon the rarer items with the zeal of the truly homesick. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Sushi entrées $17-$39.50.)</p>

Chinatown Brasserie, the new tenant, has fancy food and frothy drinks: it’s Ruby Foo’s without the tourists, or Mr. Chow’s with a lot more camp and only slightly less attitude. (The management is trying hard to cultivate the appearance of popularity, and if that means making people wait at the bar before they are seated at one of several empty tables, so be it: the frozen mai tais are arguably the restaurant’s best offering.) Downstairs, the late, lamented Fez night club has been tricked out in a style best described as Shanghai Rat Pack, including leopard-print carpeting, white vinyl swivel stools, gilded pillars, and a koi pond.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">The menu is dominated by American Chinese-restaurant classics. Peking duck—the centerpiece—has a dark, burnished glaze and crackly skin, and is delicious. Several other standards have Southeast Asian touches that work nicely, like the hint of lemongrass in the wonton soup. The branzino, which is steamed with ginger, scallions, and pickled plums, then beheaded at the table, is tender and subtly tart, but the chicken with mushrooms is sodden and salty. It might make respectable takeout, but at these prices, with the disposable chopsticks and the colonialist-fantasia decor, it is cloying.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Daytime is a completely different story. The extensive dim-sum offerings are comparable to what you’d find in the real Chinatown, but thoroughly sanitized, and at several times the price. Steamed pork buns are tiny but perfect: the dough is fresh and springy, with generous chunks of savory pork inside. The pot stickers, which are flavored with ginger, are surprisingly delicate, but the broth inside the soup dumplings is syrupy and repellently sweet. The atmosphere is nothing like the dim-sum experience to be had a mile to the south—no steaming carts bearing surprises, no free tea, no live poultry or counterfeit purses outside—but perhaps that is the point. At midday on a recent Saturday, as the “Sex and the City” theme song played insistently but incongruously in the background, three nearby tables were populated by twentysomethings who had brought their grandparents.

It was the Little Owl, the inaugural venture from Joey Campanaro and Gabriel Stulman, but her confusion was understandable: in a neighborhood teeming with beloved holes-in-the-wall—a disproportionate number of them named after animals (Grey Dog, White Horse, Spotted Pig)—it can be hard to stand out. Campanaro (chef, formerly of the Harrison) and Stulman (front man) manage to, mainly by evincing the friendliness of a golden retriever.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">Nestled on the ground floor of a picturesque tenement (it served as the B-roll backdrop on “Friends”), theirs is a mellow, slightly on-the-fly operation. Sprays of blue hydrangeas, or whatever seasonal flowers are available, are tucked into the nooks of windows. A Vornado fan attempts to keep the room cool; nobody freaks out if you wander outside with a glass of wine. When Stulman decided that the space needed a pick-me-up, he simply dragged in some ladders and spray-painted the ceiling gold. </p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">The crowd is equally motley: <em>Times</em> readers in natural fibers, an interior-decorator type wearing white slacks printed with sprigs of coral. As in a scene from a weird dream, you might spy a friend from college sitting at the bar with Mandy Moore. Everybody loves the ricotta cavatelli, brimming with bacon hunks and fava beans. Beans—butter ones this time—also appear as a side dish, accompanied by escarole and smoked ham. Immersed in tomato sauce, topped with cheese, they’re addictive, good enough for a whole meal. The famous twelve-ounce pork chop, mighty but tender, mostly lives up to the hype. But the mystifying strawberry custard, which is really more of a shortcake, is far too bready by any name. Still, the aftertaste is sweet: when a diner returned for her left-behind datebook, even her Bic ballpoint had been put aside and lovingly recapped. (Open daily for dinner, Saturdays and Sundays for brunch. Entrées $17-$26.)</p>

The younger ones ostentatiously chomp on unlit cigars, compare notes on the best golf clubs, and recap last night’s poker game. Here is the crowd that might order foie gras and peppery beef carpaccio, heaping bowls of crisp fries, perfectly battered onion rings, and thick slabs of precisely graded meat, all in one evening. The room itself could be called handsome, in the sense that it looks expensive without being particularly attractive. It’s cavernous and clangorous, with an immense glass wall, which also acts as wine storage, separating the bar from the dining room, a rather sloppy landscape painting of the High Line on another wall, and a few lumps of unsightly pink salt rock scattered about. But the seats are roomy and comfortable, and the tables are narrow and spaced wide enough apart that a little insider information can be kept between friends. </p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">The food is not nearly as blunt and bland as the décor might suggest. One recent evening, heirloom cherry tomatoes, accompanied by a spicy pile of cress, were soft and skin-free and burst with a bright sweetness. The roasted duck had a gentle infusion of lavender and berries that didn’t stand in the way of the poultry’s natural flavor. And then there were the sixteen varieties of steaks, a bit of ridiculous culinary machismo—is the “platinum Wagyu” from Australia really worth twenty dollars an ounce, or is it just showing off? A New York strip of (non-platinum) Wagyu beef was tender and juicy, but its rub had a too aggressive salinity; even the more assertive grass-fed filet mignon wilted a bit under the seasoning. </p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">Perhaps it’s that this restaurant is only one branch of Tom Colicchio’s ever-expanding empire, perhaps it’s all the expense accounts being charged up around the room, but its luxury has a corporate chill. Late-evening customers who have lingered over dessert—a childish, indulgent list that includes doughnuts, a make-your-own sundae, and a sticky-bun doppelgänger called “monkey bread”—might find the lights going up momentarily, giving an eerie glimpse of the room’s origins, with the diners themselves so many widgets waiting to leave the factory floor.

Café Lex, Lex 92, and La Collina have perished there, unfortunate disappearances in what is already a gustatory wasteland. Into both breaches steps Sfoglia, whose chef-owners, Ron Suhanosky and his wife, Colleen Marnell-Suhanosky, have offered some solutions to the dead-corner/lame-neighborhood problem. The first was to move the entrance, against their architects’ advice, from avenue to street—a feng-shui-ish maneuver that helped transform the dining area from disconcerting storefront to hospitable country kitchen. The other was to make their restaurant really good. Sfoglia got its start on Nantucket, another culinary backwater, in 2000. The couple (Ron is the chef, and Colleen is the pastry chef, whose <em>torta del giorno</em> must—and should—be ordered at the beginning of your meal) spent years plotting this expansion to the Big Island. They had the bold idea not only of making a living at it but of kicking off a restaurant renaissance, or naissance, in the Upper East Side’s upper reaches, where they’d decided to live, and where many of their Nantucket regulars live as well. </p><p data-wc="184" word_count="184">Sfoglia’s atmosphere is rustic and trattorian: rough-hewn tables (which you might share with strangers), mismatched plates, dish towels for napkins, tumblers for wine (stemware is available upon request), and, in lieu of gladiolus, colanders full of lemons or potatoes. After several months without a liquor license, during which they poured your wine as though it were theirs (i.e., with alacrity), the Suhanoskys got one a few weeks ago; they intend to start serving homemade limoncello. The menu changes every couple of weeks, according to what the farmers bring to town. And concoctions that may seem, in the reading, to be slightly ridiculous turn out, in the eating, to be perfectly serious (but not too self-important)—on a recent visit, there was a risotto with blueberries and mushrooms, and a sea-urchin spaghetti with raisins and pine nuts. Such successful experiments are hard to come by in the veal-shank Zip Codes. A few weeks later, the caprese—heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella, pesto—came with wedges of watermelon. It was very red, and it worked. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $16-$26.)</p>

Her new spot, in Chelsea, is swankier, with adobelike walls painted a livid orange, and a bar and lounge in front where guests can sip expensive cocktails or tequilas. Banquettes thread up one side of the narrow room, facing an open kitchen, where Ballesteros, a diminutive figure of nunlike severity, marshals her small kitchen staff. Perhaps on a dare, two tables have been squeezed into a back garden the size of a fire escape. </p><p data-wc="281" word_count="281">Ballesteros promises to deliver refined Mexican cuisine, which essentially means nicely executed, fairly familiar dishes; Mexican cooking, although regionally diverse, centers on a few staple processes. The menu’s corn-tortilla dishes are uniformly excellent—including long crispy flautas with shredded chicken and mini tostadas bearing sautéed scallops topped with a gorgeously balanced mix of aioli and mango salsa—although the chips that accompany an order of salsa or guacamole are oddly insipid. A few ingredients still unfamiliar to most Americans pop up on the menu, such as huitlacoche, a fungus that infects maize and is considered a delicacy in Mexico. Restaurateurs, trying to get wary diners to eat the stuff, have taken to calling it Mexican truffle, but, served here in a thick soup topped with <em>Cotija</em> cheese, it proves to have a sweeter, less intense taste. The wisdom of sticking to traditional formats seems borne out by some of the more innovative creations. Chicken with squash-blossom purée, portobello mushroom, and goat cheese sounded enticing but was basically a piece of breast meat overwhelmed by a large puddle of what seemed to be squash soup.<br/> Dessert draws inspiration from the flavor of mole sauce, giving a dramatic twist to that ubiquitous restaurant offering the warm chocolate cake. Each bite should be savored: precisely twenty seconds after hitting the tongue, the rich chocolate taste gives way to an increasingly intense bloom of chili. After another twenty seconds, the heat fades and you can take a second bite. Those foolish enough to wolf their cake down all at once can be seen sipping water or letting their mouths hang open.

So, when the Çakir boys set to work on Turks &amp; Frogs Tribeca, the restaurant version of their popular West Village wine bar and antique shop, they took care to preserve the division of labor that has served them so well a few blocks north. Orhan does the food. Osman does the furniture. (The grub is Turkish; the fittings are mostly French. Both are for sale.) A cobalt glass <em>nazar boncuk</em> dangles above the cash register, insuring continued prosperity for all.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">Judging from the ratio of BlackBerry checks to smoke breaks, the crowd is more American than Euro, but whatever rivalries exist are strictly within the Turks &amp; Frogs family. “They don’t do this at your place, do they?” a bartender at the Tribeca branch recently said to a West Village regular, before tossing a bottle of Chenin Blanc into the air, like a club. Orhan says that “all Turkish people, we like red,” which explains the signature tomato-colored walls. Warm receptions are apparently also a national hallmark. “Hello, I am Mete. What are you reading?” one employee said, coming around from behind the bar to offer a handshake. A tasty loaf of flat bread studded with caraway seeds appears immediately; later, one might receive a shot of Turkish liquor called “lion’s milk.” Distilled from anise, it looks white and tastes black.</p><p data-wc="145" word_count="145">But first: <em>mücver</em>, lebni, harem salatasi! The array of salads and appetizers, pre-made examples of which the waiters bring around on a big tray, makes you want to sing. It’s possible to go wrong (the smoked eggplant, for instance, is more slimy than savory), but the yogurts are uniformly tangy, and the hummus benefits from a generous dose of garlic. <em>Manti</em>, tricorn-shaped dumplings, are stuffed with mint and lamb and dunked in yogurt; the effect is both fluffy and dense, in the way of Styrofoam peanuts. Like snow, the dish has a fleeting beauty: upon first forkful, paprika seeps across its creamy white surface, giving the whole concoction a weird orange tint. But the portion is huge, and, as a smart Turk or Frog knows, that’s a surefire way to please a Yank. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $14-$25.)</p>

In February, John Wheeler, of the Mississippi barbecue team Natural Born Grillers, hauled a twenty-seven-hundred-pound specimen from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to Morningside Heights—site of this new spot, a collaboration between Michael Eberstadt, owner of Slice of Harlem and the late Bayou, and Charles Gabriel, of Charles’ Southern Style Kitchen, at 151st Street (Wheeler is the honorary “BBQ Pit Master”). The walls are covered with old photos of uptown street scenes, selected by the Harlem preservationist Michael Henry Adams; even so, Gabriel calls Rack &amp; Soul his “downtown” place.</p><p data-wc="71" word_count="71">It’s not haute barbecue: Blue Smoke’s gazpacho and chilled beets are nowhere to be found. Instead, each table gets a basket of biscuits, the insides heavy with butter, the outsides crusted with honey. Unlike Gabriel’s other place, there is wine here, but it is served almost ambivalently, in small water glasses. Sweet tea and Abita beer, from Louisiana, go better with the main events: barbecue and fried chicken.</p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">The applewood-fired smoker was worth the haul. After four hours, the baby back ribs are perfectly sealed, with succulent pink meat that falls easily from the bone. They come by either the half or the quarter rack, but it’s hard to imagine only ordering the quarter. The fried chicken has a finely textured, pleasantly dry coating, and the flavoring is just right. It’s Gabriel’s mother’s recipe (he is obligingly coy about the “special seasoning”), and he personally tends the skillets.</p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">Unfortunately, the kitchen has a way of running out of basics—ribs, one recent evening, not to mention catfish, potato salad, and banana pudding. (A waitress, warily eyeing the kitchen, said, “I don’t know what’s going on back there.”) But the crowd is mellow; no one seems bothered, not even by the music (this may be the first soul-food restaurant to feature a soundtrack of Foreigner and Journey). After the enormous portions, dessert seems impossible. But the frozen lemon cake is startlingly fresh and tart, and goes down easily. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $9.95-$17.95.)</p>

(Appropriately enough, the restaurant’s name, according to Kim, comes from the Italian phrase for a chowhound—<em>una buona forchetta</em>.) Since then, they’ve added some staff and opened the back garden, and, despite some early reports of two-hour waits, they seem to have found their footing. The trajectory from easygoing drop-in joint to destination eatery could be considered complete when, one recent Sunday, Charles Kiely and Sharon Pachter, the owners of the Grocery and the first couple of Brooklyn culinary arts, were spotted on their way out. </p><p data-wc="88" word_count="88">The dining room, which Schneider built up from a nearly raw space, has a curvy wood-panelled ceiling; the effect is something like being inside a Stradivarius. It can get pretty noisy, but two corner booths near the door offer cozy privacy. The food is as inviting as the atmosphere, with standout appetizers from around the world—homemade pork-and-chive dumplings, plump and greaseless; a meaty crab cake, its dryness ameliorated by a lively chili aioli; tempura zucchini blossoms that are airy and crisp, despite being stuffed with Manchego cheese.</p><p data-wc="155" word_count="155">The entrées are mostly revisions of the classics, like roasted chicken, which has golden skin and juicy flesh and comes with an Asian black-bean butter sauce and potato-parsnip mash. Kimchi rice makes tenderly grilled skirt steak and an accompanying egg unconventional without being overbearingly whimsical. More straightforward dishes suffer in comparison: the pork is perfectly braised but a little boring. Manhattanites, a delicate and demanding tribe, might fuss at the thought of making a pilgrimage for such simple pleasures, but the warmth with which Kim and Schneider run the place offers a rare luxury: they make you feel like a well-loved neighbor. One evening, a table’s order of Steve’s Key Lime Pie, a local specialty, was supplemented by a complimentary helping of flourless chocolate cake, a truffle-like version of the often bricklike restaurant standard. The waiter explained, “We just thought you deserved it.” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner. Entrées $9.50-$20.)</p>

Like its department-store-restaurant forebears—such as Lord &amp; Taylor’s Bird Cage and B. Altman’s Charleston Gardens—BG, which opened last year, is meant to provide an oasis for exhausted shoppers. But those fond, fusty places were not destinations like BG, with its north-facing views of Central Park. The question is whether, despite its up-to-date menu, it would be anyone’s destination more than once: the room, with its pale-green avifaunal wallpaper, windowside tables for two, and fresh linen tablecloths, is much more satisfying than the fare. Instead of a perfect egg-salad sandwich, for instance, there is an overpriced plate of four devilled eggs with an undue abundance of Parma ham, and the dark edges of the egg mixture betold an assembly-line approach to preparation; these little devils had been made too far ahead of time. A warm vegetable salad, a specialty of the chef, Keith M. Williams, consists of slices of up to twenty-one different baby vegetables, such as wax beans, sugar snap peas, summer squash, and radishes. It couldn’t have been cuter, but the wee things were overwhelmed by a heavy coat of butter.</p><p data-wc="134" word_count="134">Asian chicken salad—glass noodles with Napa cabbage, slivered red and yellow peppers, and watercress in a sesame-ginger vinaigrette—was also surprisingly heavy, and drowning in its dressing. Six oven-roasted shrimp, tails perkily pointing up, stood in a lobster-brandy sauce that was somehow too autumnal and burnt-tasting. The star of this dish was a supporting actor—a wild-mushroom flan that was the soul of savoriness. A waiter recommended roasted peaches for dessert, which turned out to be a whole peach, singular, in a sumptuous sabayon with a dollop of pistachio ice cream. Good luck achieving old-fashioned elegance as you attempt to cut the unyielding tennis ball of a peach and keep it from skidding off the plate and onto the floor.

Not so in West Chelsea, the night-club vortex up the avenue, where the right kind of late-night chow has long been scarce as silence. Such, anyway, is the theory, or one of the theories, behind Pre:Post, a new dusk-to-dawn restaurant where the slick kids are encouraged to gather and dine before and after their submersion into the clubs down the block. Like a lock-in/lock-out chamber in a submarine, it provides a transition from one environment to the other, containing elements both of club life (subwoofers, private “cabanas,” hotties) and life outside (windows, nourishment, affordable alcohol). Incongruities abound: the cabanas in back are glassed in, like squash courts, whereas the booths in front are phony log cabins made out of birch, and the tables are sheathed in white rubber—perhaps to make them spill- and snort-proof.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">There are two menus; the switch happens at midnight, when the place is suddenly all but empty. The “pre” period, which peaks at around eleven and suits the sybarite better than it does the claustrophobe, features the usual semi-fancy <em>fin-de-millénaire</em> fare—braised short ribs, sesame-crusted tuna, yada yada. It’s in the “post” phase, in the wee hours, that the place shows its stuff. The menu seems, sensibly, to have been devised for, if not by, someone on the tail end of an epic bender. There are burgers, baby-back ribs, passable pizzas (with toppings like Peking duck), and, for the grease-averse or conspicuously unhungry, handsome platters of steamed veggies. The most luscious thing, believe it or not, may well be the chicken pita sandwich with chipotle mayo, onions, and bacon.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">There are specialty drinks, of course, and they are named after night clubs. The Crobar, which contains tequila, jalapeño, cilantro, and some other tangy things, has a pleasing peppery bite. The Marquee (vodka, cucumber, dill, etc.) tastes like medicine; its namesake may want to pull a Larry David and lobby for a swap with the Bungalow 8 (Baileys, muddled almonds, and so on). There is also a drink called the Take Me Home and another called the Take Me to Bed, designed, apparently, to make you feel like an ass twice over, first for uttering the words and then for sipping something so disagreeably sweet.

You call; you wait; you may be asked to leave a message with your number, name, and hoped-for reservation time. Googling your date before dinner is standard practice, but your dinner Googling you for a date? Perhaps it’s best to show up and appeal to the cartographer himself.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">Theoretically, the point of an eatery, however new or glam, is eating, but, at Mr. Chow, getting your hands on a menu is Obstacle No. 2. Under the pretense of hospitality, the waiters—all male, wearing tuxes, speaking with traces of whatever Romance language—prefer to order for you. Just say “land,” “sky,” or “sea.” In any case, count on getting Mr. Chow’s signature noodles, which a pasta thrower slaps out near the bar. Sadly, they’re as gelatinous as the lo mein at your neighborhood Golden Dragon, and the accompanying meat sauce, oversugared and tomatoey, tastes exactly like Chef Boyardee Beefaroni. The buffalo, on the other hand, is brown and dry and molded into little briquettes—a silver plateful of dung, for $31.50. Stick with the “gambei with goodies,” a secret recipe of deep-fried something-or-other that calls to mind late-night binges at the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">On a recent night, status-conscious barflies (one man grabbed a nearby woman’s top, asking, “Is that Hugo Boss?”) thrilled to see Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber cruising toward seats that might have been their own. (Chow pals are listed in an A-to-Z booklet that comes with the check.) It was a full house at ten, when Karl Lagerfeld appeared. No matter: soon, a troupe of white-suited flunkies cleared a space in the middle of the room and scurried through, carrying a table over their heads.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/06/19/tables-for-two-109	Degustation	null	null	null	null	2006/06/19	<p data-wc="128" word_count="128">Jack and Grace Lamb opened Degustation in April, next to their upscale sushi restaurant, Jewel Bako; while the O.E.D. says that “degust” means “to taste attentively,” and, in French, a <em>menu dégustation</em> is a tasting menu, this spot might be better described as sushi-does-tapas. The tiny room seats about sixteen at a sushi-style counter, where diners can watch Wesley Genovart, a talented young Spanish chef, and a couple of busy assistants produce their somewhat finicky dishes. One suspects that the Lambs simply hope to find a viable use for the room, which was previously occupied by their short-lived ventures Jewel Bako Robata (a Japanese grill joint) and Grace’s Kalbi Bar (a Korean grill joint). Still, Genovart produces food that is striking and occasionally inspired.</p><p data-wc="188" word_count="188">A <em>croqueta</em> that arrives as an <em>amuse-bouche</em> is a sign of what is to come. Sitting in a teardrop of paprika aioli, the size of a cherry and as light as cotton candy, it has a delicately crunchy exterior that gives way to a creamy bacon filling. Among the smaller offerings—there’s no absolute distinction between appetizers and main courses—the fried baby artichoke, which comes with a Kumamoto oyster, mussel broth, and grapefruit foam, is a persuasive exercise in opposing textures (from crispy to slimy) and tastes (from briny to citrus). The slow-poached egg with Serrano ham in herbed chicken broth is less rewarding. Despite the care lavished on it—forty-five temperature-controlled minutes in the immersion circulator—the result hardly surpasses chicken soup with a soft-boiled egg in it. Innovation has its excesses, too, in the larger dishes, but the successes easily outnumber the failures. The most satisfying of these is grilled squid stuffed with short ribs and served alongside chorizo-tinged lentils; and the sliced pan-roasted pork belly, sturdy dominoes of fat, is wonderfully offset by a bed of shimeji mushrooms, scallions, and pickled jalapeños.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">The main drawback to serving tapas as you would sushi is that diners may leave the restaurant hungry. What else can one expect from a menu on which the largest item is quail? But the effects of scarcity can provide their own entertainment: on a recent night, the conversation of a nearby couple turned, as if with some subconscious prompting, to the occult joys of late-night cereal binges. (Open daily for dinner. Dishes $4-$18.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/06/12/a-voce	A VOCE	41 Madison Ave., at 26th St. 	null	null	null	2006/06/12	<p data-wc="163" word_count="163">For the past few years, Andrew Carmellini has been a Cyrano de Bergerac of sorts on the New York restaurant scene, sweeping diners off their feet while under the aegis of other, better known chefs (most recently Daniel Boulud, at Café Boulud). His talents insured that he couldn’t maintain complete anonymity—he was named Best New Chef by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> in 2000, and Best New York City Chef at the Beard Awards in 2005—but he managed to avoid creating a cult of personality. Now he’s stepped out of the shadows with A Voce, which opened in March. Still, his self-effacement seems to persist: instead of giving the place his own name, he chose the Italian phrase for “word of mouth.” The space itself is demure, almost cold, with a sylvan interior (wood-panelled entry, colorfully lit mobiles of crosshatched sticks, bluntly lopped-off birch trunks propped up in the corners) that somewhat sinisterly echoes the leafiness of Madison Square Park, just across the way. </p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">If modesty is Carmellini’s virtue, his staff has no problem talking up the place. Recently, the neatly turned out manager placed a roasted-beet salad in front of a diner and, almost to himself, softly exclaimed, “Beautiful! Beautiful!” It was: firm ruby beets larded with Gorgonzola dolce and hazelnuts. Carmellini executes his dishes with grace, impeccable ingredients, and just a touch of innovation. Lamb tortellini, dotted with sweet cherry tomatoes and dressed with lemon zest, had a warm glow; the lamb Bolognese, served over homemade pappardelle, was rich and sandy, the rough flavor tamed by excellent sheep-milk ricotta.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">Not everyone is seduced by Carmellini’s food; one evening, the duck meatballs, sour and sweet, were well received on one side of the table but dismissed on the other, by a self-proclaimed “meatball connoisseur.” “The meat just doesn’t stand out,” he complained. An entrée of black sea bass was equally divisive: to her, the fish was succulent, the broth bright and fresh, the addition of mussels and croutons a delight. To him, the plate was sparse, the fish too fishy, the vegetables too meagre. “It was good, just not thirty-dollars good,” he groused. At least there was dessert to unite the table: <em>bomboloni</em>, vanilla or coffee custard encased in lemony dough, then dipped in chocolate. “These are delicious,” the manager said as he set them down, and paused, wriggling his fingers, in search of the perfect word. “They are fiendish.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $19-$30.)</p>

But visitors seem truly mystified when they’re taken up a flight of iron stairs in a garment-district tenement building to a red-lit hallway (which at first seems only to lead to a seedy-looking rest room). A last-minute right turn reveals a sit-down dining room that looks something like a failed bordello. There are more red light bulbs, deep, determined mauve paint on one wall, and a tin ceiling; fire escapes are visible through dirty windows; gilt-framed chalkboards display specials and an incredibly high-end wine list. “Have you ever been here before?” Al, a bald, mustachioed man perpetually lumbering across the room, asks. He never quite makes eye contact through his thick lenses, so it’s not always clear whom he is addressing. “Do you know what our pizza looks like?”</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">There’s no reason to be here if you’re not informed about the pizza—it’s square, and not that big. Two grown men will need one and a half pies. It’s not Sicilian: it has a seriously thin, delicate crust. There’s often a burned blister of cheese looming in the center. The sauce is snappy. The plain pie is heaven—the crazy toppings, like a full serving of lasagna, tend to turn the pizza into soup. And don’t stray too far from the pie. The specials chalkboard usually lists Buffalo-style fried calamari in blue-cheese sauce, an irresistibly disgusting combination of fat and grease. Eating the gnocchi is like filling up your stomach with rocks, and the salads are massive and doused with enough oil to make even the iceberg lettuce wilt. For dessert, there’s cheesecake and tiramisu that tastes like freezer-burned Sara Lee.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Who patronizes such an oddball spot? There are a few clues close to the door. A flyer for Jahir and the Experiment’s hip-hop disk (Lazzara’s owners run a recording studio upstairs) is posted above a rack of the free fashion trade magazine <em>Fashion Mannuscript.</em> Hip-hop luminaries from Sean (Diddy) Combs to Russell Simmons and Jennifer Lopez are regular customers, but the place is mostly full of mid-level garmentos—earnest men and women, not as well dressed as one might expect, who take their business meetings here. Their presence gives the strange place some normalcy—at night, Spandex World, across the street, is shuttered, and the place turns positively spooky. (Open weekdays for lunch and Tuesdays through Fridays for dinner. Entrées $6.95-$18.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/05/29/morimoto-and-buddakan	MORIMOTO AND BUDDAKAN	80 Tenth Ave., between 15th and 16th Sts. 	null	null	null	2006/05/29	<p data-wc="95" word_count="95">In January, just before making his Manhattan début with these two supersized eateries, the Philadelphia restaurateur Stephen Starr boasted to the <em>Times</em> that “Morimoto will be far more interesting than any restaurant New York has ever seen.” Well, maybe, if New York hasn’t lately visited Megu, or En Japanese Brasserie, or even Del Posto, just across the street. It is true, though, that Starr has something special in the Teddy-bear-like Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto, more mascot than chef, who makes nightly rounds in his eponymous restaurant to scattered applause and blinding photo flashes. </p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">How much Morimoto actually contributes to putting food on the plate is unclear, but the kitchen deserves praise. The Japanese-fusion menu has its low moments: a tuna-pizza appetizer paired oddly tasteless, almost mushy fish with an unappealing anchovy <em>aioli</em>. But there’s a wonderfully tender ten-hour pork, set into a warm, salty congee, and a custard of briny tofu made tableside, accompanied by a delicate lobster sauce. An entrée of <em>ishi yaki buri bop</em>, yellowtail and rice cooked, with a tiny egg, inside a hot bowl, makes each plump and sticky kernel of rice pop with flavor. It’s nearly enough to distract one from the cold, glittering surfaces: the wall of water bottles, the slippery, translucent chopsticks, the diners’ sleek, plasticine faces.</p><p data-wc="200" word_count="200">At Buddakan, on the other hand, nothing could mitigate the unpleasantly garish atmosphere. The upstairs lounge is clogged with slick-haired men doused in cologne and young, look-alike women (black sheaths, vampish lipstick), at least some of whom are meant, however haplessly, to be hostesses. Guests descend a steep flight of steps to the dining hall, an absurd palace fantasia featuring a banquet table for thirty, where the crowd spills out from the adjoining “Golden Library,” clutching brightly colored cocktails. These have ominously theological names like Sin and Sacred, and the cloying taste of Communion wine. Anyone who can finish one, much less order another, probably isn’t too concerned about the food, though some of it is very good: frog legs, stir-fried with chives, are addictively nutty, and the taro-puff lollipops’ flaky shells conceal a generous portion of ginger-infused pork. The rest of it—Peking duck, short ribs—is pleasant enough, and the vegetable fried rice nearly justifies its price with the addition of a sweet coconut foam. Too bad it all gets blanketed under unmodulated spice—an attempt, perhaps, to penetrate those booze-deadened taste buds. (Both restaurants open daily for dinner. Morimoto entrées $23-$44. Buddakan entrées $14-$56.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/05/22/momofuku	MOMOFUKU	163 First Ave., at 10th St. 	null	null	null	2006/05/22	<p data-wc="112" word_count="112">Momofuku bills itself as a noodle bar, which seems a bit like calling Le Bernardin a crab shack. Its owner and chief ramenhead, David Chang, for one thing, was a nominee for the James Beard Foundation’s Rising Star Chef of the Year award. The restaurant also has to be the best place in town to end up after a long day’s schlep. Those post-and-lintel stools that fit like Yaffa Blocks against the big island tables! Ducasse may provide ottomans for purses, but Momofuku has cubbies, a good way to make you forget the futility, in the face of the grub that’s coming, of having lugged around your gym bag.</p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">Carbs and animal fat are Momofuku’s invincible tag team. The steamed buns, for instance, turn out to be fluffy pockets of dough, sliced in half, smeared with hoisin sauce, and stuffed full of Berkshire pork that falls apart like barbecue. Momofuku Ramen begins as a bed of noodles; Chang and his fellow-chef, Joaquin Baca (a meat-loving Texan), add pig shoulder and belly and top it with their signature poached egg. The tiny green peas in the bowl—easy to drop with chopsticks—are so robust they bounce. Even Brussels sprouts, which come in a hot kimchi purée, are amped up with thick chunks of bacon.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">In a place where the veggies are this loud, the music is bound to be important, and Chang and Baca play everything from Wu-Tang Clan to Ozzy Osbourne, with two firm exceptions: no Springsteen and no Kenny Loggins. No wine, either; just beer and sake. The line cooks, anyway, are the real entertainment. Slamming and sweating their way around an open galley kitchen, they manage to make noodles look dangerous. (The backward hats and skull-and-bones tattoos don’t hurt.) The other night, one of them threw some squirming crawfish in a pan and lit it on fire, like a pyrotechnic effect at a heavy-metal show. The flames sizzled, and a waitress, squeezing past the stove, reapplied her lip gloss and coyly bumped him with her butt. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $9-$23.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/05/15/bohemian-hall-and-beer-garden	BOHEMIAN HALL AND BEER GARDEN	29-19 24th Ave., between 29th and 31st Sts., Astoria 	null	null	null	2006/05/15	<p data-wc="130" word_count="130">Five centuries ago, German brewers began planting trees in their yards to keep the beer cellars below them cool in the summer. Before long, people realized that it would be pleasant to sit under these trees and drink the beer. Eureka: the beer garden. At one point, there were hundreds of beer gardens in New York. Now, there is really only one, in Astoria. (Other contenders, small and mostly treeless, aren’t in the same league.) Tended since its opening, in 1919, by the Bohemian Hall, an adjacent civic center of sorts for the Czechs and Slovaks who dominated the neighborhood in those days, the garden can seem, once you’ve had a mug or two and surveyed the polyglot throng, to represent the pinnacle of urban living: variegation meets fermentation. </p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">The garden is connected to a warren of barrooms and dining nooks; this labyrinthine layout can exacerbate the beer’s more deleterious effects. The garden itself, however, is easily navigable: an acre of picnic tables, enclosed by stucco walls and shaded by maples and lindens. It accommodates several hundred patrons, including cigarette smokers and little children, and the scene can seem bohemian, with both big and little “B”: you may hear “Na zdraví!” or see a T-shirt reading “The liver is evil. It must be punished.” But it encompasses all. One recent warm evening, some Fire Department recruits began chanting not very nice things about the N.Y.P.D. Security guards move in when things get out of hand.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Servers pass through from time to time, but they will only fetch food; beer you must get yourself. The food can take a while, and most of it—goulash, schnitzel, “Vepro, Knedlo, Zelo” (roast pork with sauerkraut and dumplings)—is best ingested solely for the purposes of beer absorption. The kielbasa, however, is first-rate, spicy and firm, and right up there, the kielbasa connoisseurs say, with the best in Queens. There really isn’t any need for anything else, unless you’re trying to make a point, in which case custom calls for fried cheese, with ham and tartar sauce. There ought to be places like this all over town. Maybe our graveyards should be beer gardens. (Open Mondays through Fridays for dinner, weekends for lunch and dinner. Entrées $5.75-$14.50.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/05/08/bouley-upstairs	BOULEY, UPSTAIRS	130 West Broadway, at Duane St. 	null	null	null	2006/05/08	<p data-wc="102" word_count="102">Few chefs are as restless as David Bouley, and this tri-level venture across the road from his flagship restaurant takes eclecticism (or sheer caprice) to new levels. The ground floor is a bakeshop, selling plush loaves and Parisian pâtisseries. The basement is a “market,” in reality a cabinet of meat and fish of irreproachable quality but insufficient variety. And, in the evenings, the top floor is a tiny restaurant, serving French-American fare and—why not?—sushi. A mission statement promises a “dining experience defined by eclecticism in taste and clarity in presentation.” No quibbles with the first half of this claim.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">There is, however, little effort to integrate the various areas of the menu into a meal. A Japanese salad of grilled eel and cucumber and a squash soup dappled with sweet chestnuts are equally outstanding as starters, but nothing from the kitchen ever arrives at the same time as anything from the sushi bar. The good-humored staff manages brilliantly, considering the tiny space and the complexity of the operation, but chaos is never far away. The tightly spaced chairs necessitate a certain agility from the waitstaff, or at least a tolerance of thrown elbows; one diner’s apology for leaning back into a waitress met with a breezy “I’m used to it.” </p><p data-wc="158" word_count="158">However, it’s amazing that things work as well as they do. The wait for a table is ameliorated by the offer of a drink; the specialty cocktails come in combinations (gin and ginger, Campari and <em>soju</em>) that attempt a cultural synthesis similar to that of the food. Bouley, when all’s said and done, can really cook, and clearly cares about little else. Halibut served with sweet corn and shiitake mushrooms in a lemon-and-thyme sauce is a marvel of aromatic delicacy. Lobster is transformed, but not overwhelmed, by red-wine sauce and a cushion of parsnip purée. It’s best to arrive late in the evening, when the room thins, the pace slows, and, sometimes, Bouley himself casually munches burgers with his staff. It’s then that his notion of the place as somewhere you might wander in for a bite to eat starts to seem almost realistic. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $12-$21.)</p>

(The halfhearted bistro décor looks as though the owners put in a few red leather banquettes and then realized that the split-level room would never amount to much.) Most of the diners have run off to the clutch of theatres across the street; if you’re the type who is habitually forced to take daylight reservations, it’s not bad to feel like the last man standing. Let the early birds have their spectacles—this is theatre-district food worth lingering over. </p><p data-wc="200" word_count="200">The restaurant has been around only one year—it’s a Pasternak, Batali, and Bastianich deal—but it already has a reputation: a year ago the <em>Post’s</em> Page Six reported that four employees were fired after a security video camera caught them engaged in an after-hours orgy. Now it has a new mystery: what is Laurent Gras, the Michelin-starred chef who made the old Peacock Alley great, doing here? Perhaps he’s biding his time while a bigger deal brews; in the meantime, he’s turning out pitch-perfect “cuisine du soleil,” a tribute to his youth on the Côte d’Azur. One carryover from his silver-domed past: Gras loves to offer a spectacular tasting menu. Even on a bistro budget, he’s not going to rob guests of a chance to feast. One recent night, the For the Table menu, which is served family style, featured sweetbreads with mustard and apple, prawns in a saffron-and-zucchini soup, clams gratiné, and a perfect spinach salad. That was the first course. It moved on, with no pomp, to striped bass, lamb saddle, and a spit-roasted poussin. A fresh baguette was supplied to mop up the splendid sauces in their copper pans.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">Midday, sunlight fills the room and diners are far enough from the office, at this distant stretch of Forty-second Street, to put work out of their minds. To start, there’s an excellent version of a niçoise street-food staple—a chickpea-flour crêpe with smashed-olive paste. And the linguine alle vongole, with an unusually thick sauce of olive oil, white wine, and garlic coating the clams, shows that Gras won’t allow even the simplest dishes to be ordinary. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $21-$29; For the Table menu $42 per person.)</p>

The black lockers, in the hallway between the front door and the small bar, are the most sensible and least elegant aspect of the place; it’s all up—way up—from there, starting with a drinks menu that features the delicious Rolle, a blend of house-infused apple vodka, Calvados, and lemon juice, served chilled and straight up and bringing forth, with its scent and its taste, a profound sense of paradise found.</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">The restaurant is just a hundred yards or so away from the mayhem of Union Square, with its hordes of young people running after a good time as if it were about to roll under a couch; here, by contrast, all is calm, and the clientele, most of a rather more parental age, bask in the flattering, warm lighting and dignified Upper East Side atmosphere (made even more pleasing by the absence of background music). The food is a class act as well. The appetizers, by and large, point toward the sea, and you could do no better than the oyster chowder, a warm, frothy soup with plump oysters, little clusters of sevruga caviar, and slivers of applewood-smoked bacon.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Many of the entrées double their interest by showing two facets of an ingredient—slowly poached salmon with salmon belly, seared on one side, and a casserole and filet of Chatham cod, for example. The grilled lamb T-bone, the favorite of the table, was accompanied by a moussaka roulade, a little package of lamb wrapped with eggplant and finished with a sparky red-pepper sauce. Roasted polenta cake with braised pineapple and a dollop of yogurt ice cream was the top dessert, beating out the chocolate chiffon cake, which seemed to have been taken directly from the refrigerator. The old-fashioned atmosphere of Tocqueville is winning, up to a point; that point was the moment, experienced by one threesome, that the waiter, ignoring the decidedly female name on the credit card, atavistically placed the receipt right between people named Robert and Charles. (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $27-$36.)</p>

The experience, he says, instilled in him a distaste for theme-restaurant kitsch. So what’s with the selection of canned beers, the barman in a plaid shirt, and the antler chandeliers? And how about that photograph of a lumberjackish guy with a gun, hanging over the cash register? Actually, the seemingly ersatz country boy is the caretaker of some land Cipriani has upstate, which serves as the inspiration for the restaurant’s neo-rustic feel. “We wanted it to be a cross between a cabin and an homage to Frank Lloyd Wright,” Cipriani said. So there are fieldstone columns amidst cedar walls, sleek utensils alongside chipped china, hanging plants mixed in with sprays of wildflowers. If the Brady Bunch had had a house in the Adirondacks, it might have looked a lot like Lodge.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">The food, unfortunately, is closer to summer camp. While the avocado salad is pleasing enough, an appetizer of tiger shrimp is drowning in dill sauce, and the apple-cheddar fritters are pulpy and bland. It’s good to see fried chicken on a menu, especially with a tangy batter; if only the accompanying kale and mashed potatoes (which had the consistency of grits) came hot, or at least warm. The turkey meat loaf is served with a salad of tomatoes and onions that amounts to a ketchupy slop. One starts to wonder if the beer is the only thing that comes in a can.</p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">Two of Lodge’s most redeeming elements are handmade: the delicious maple-syrup gelato, from Ciao Bella, and a pair of gorgeous tables that Cipriani hewed from slabs of oak. The artisanal, do-it-yourself spirit of the place can be contagious. The other night, a man with a Mohawk was celebrating his birthday, and the waitress delivered a cake that his friends had brought—a larger-than-life rendering of the male anatomy. A few naturalistic touches didn’t prevent anyone from digging in. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $6-$14.)</p>

Downstairs there’s the convivial café; a staircase at one end leads upstairs, where a Tiffany-style glass dome, resembling a grape arbor, is the focal point of an elegant dining room. Presided over by the chef and owner, Geoffrey Zakarian (his other restaurant is Town), with the help of the executive chef, Doug Psaltis, the busy kitchen manages to provide consistently enjoyable but perfectly distinct experiences. </p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">Downstairs draws in noisy groups of young professionals. Some of its attempts at hipness, like the bottles on each table labelled “Iloveoliveoil,” feel strained, but the dark wood and the leather seats exude an upscale cool that’s borne out in the menu. On a recent evening, thick and frothy tomato fondue, spiked with pine nuts, amplified the fine flavor of an “artisanal” pasta, while the gnocchi layered with cheddar cheese, pancetta, and broccoli was an innovative twist on mac and cheese. There were a few out-of-place flourishes: a waiter presented a bottle of balsamic vinegar and delivered an exposition on its “twenty-year aging process” before pouring a thin stream over an unexceptional appetizer of artichokes. </p><p data-wc="191" word_count="191">Upstairs seems more suited for seduction, with flattering lighting and cozy, side-by-side banquettes (indeed, many of the tables were occupied by amorous couples). The menu here is prix fixe and seasonal, with the usual hospitable touches inflected with whimsy, like an amuse-bouche of a frog leg that arrived in a tiny bowl placed atop a lily pad, with a silver frog perched on its lip. Dishes are complex, almost confused: a wonderful <em>dodine</em> of foie gras and pigeon came with mâche, roasted apple, and an extraordinarily gelatinous mustard jam. But the accompaniments mostly work to the benefit of the star item: in the risotto, tender clams gave sharp counterpoint to the woodsy mushrooms, while crepinettes and raviolinis, filled with ricotta and chives, were simple harmonies to the well-seasoned prime beef. The solicitous service extends even beyond the last course; when a guest expressed delight at the apple crumb cake that diners are given on the way out, the host asked, “Would you like another?” (The café is open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; the dining room is open daily for dinner.

The room would be informal—exposed brick, perhaps an old stove against a wall, slightly eccentric light fixtures. There would be locals drinking at the bar and large round tables with families noisily celebrating birthdays. On busy nights there would be a pleasing atmosphere of barely controlled chaos, as a friendly staff made sure there were enough menus—indeed, chairs—to go round. </p><p data-wc="176" word_count="176">Noodle Pudding’s quietly excellent Italian cooking avoids both the attention-seeking chic of modern Italian cuisine (no fennel pollen here) and the caloric suicide of “Sopranos”-style fare. The menu is large, with some twenty daily specials supplementing a similar number of permanent dishes. There is usually some kind of homemade black squid-ink pasta with seafood—spaghetti with scorpion fish, say, or fettucine with octopus, calamari, and mussels—and it always tastes as if it were made about five minutes before. Lasagna works the same way: the recipes vary daily (wild boar; mushroom and leek; squash and pork sausage), and the result is always hearty and never overwhelming. The usual meats appear—osso buco, short rib, pork chop—along with an outstanding, velvety calf’s liver <em>alla veneziana</em>, while salty potatoes and leeks upstage the perfectly decent half chicken they garnish. Occasionally the inspiration falters: there are a few dishes, like the gnocchi and the rabbit, that feel as though someone just threw a lot of tomato or garlic at them and hoped for the best.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">It’s important to leave room for dessert here. All Italian restaurants have tiramisu, but rarely does it achieve quite this feathery delicacy. Best of all is the lemon-goat-cheese cake, an ingenious exercise in texture that manages to be simultaneously creamy and breadlike. Noodle Pudding doesn’t have noodle pudding, however, nor does its name have anything to do with the familiar Jewish kugel. The restaurant’s owner, Antonio Migliaccio, is from Ischia, an island near Naples, where <em>migliaccio</em> is a sweet dish, traditionally consumed at Carnival, made with pasta, eggs, and orange peel. Pity he doesn’t serve it. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner. Entrées $8.95-$24.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/03/27/del-posto	DEL POSTO	85 Tenth Ave., near 16th St. 	null	null	null	2006/03/27	<p data-wc="109" word_count="109">The first hint that there is something preposterous about Del Posto, Mario Batali’s colossal new venture on the far West Side, is a sign outside announcing “Valet Parking $29.” Inside, numerological curiosities abound. The tap water is “triple-filtered,” as is the dining experience: you seem to have at least three waiters. Dessert comes in three acts (to say nothing of the cookie cart). Three is also how many stars the <em>Times</em> gave Del Posto recently, despite Batali’s dream of four, and how many days you may need in order to recover from polishing off a cone or two of the cured pork lard that comes with the bread.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">Batali and his partners, Joseph Bastianich and his mother, Lidia, have been threatened with eviction by their landlord over construction that they may or may not have done without permission. The dispute is as overwrought as the atmosphere. The extreme pomp of the place—the footstools for ladies’ purses, the high-tea piano music, the miles of marble, the fleets of flatware—can feel like a put-on, as though this were the setting for a reality show in which celebrity chefs compete to see who can charge out-of-towners the most for offal. Some of the dishes may have you looking around for the hidden cameras: the <em>pici</em>, for example, a hollow pasta served here with black truffles, coxcombs, and duck testicles, which are bigger than you might imagine and do not taste like chicken, or duck.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">In the realm of difficult meats, nothing tops the <em>bollito misto</em>. From a tableside steam cart, a cook produces one pale distended body part after another—a veal’s tongue, a pig’s head, a pig’s foot stuffed with sausage—and carves off a portion before returning each hunk to the broth. Next to this barnyard boil, “lamb three ways” looks like beans and rice. The sprawling menu offers subtler pleasures, such as a cauliflower <em>sformato</em> (a custard, sort of), with a salad of skate and grapefruit, and chestnut ravioli, with pigeon and myrtle. Too bad they don’t deliver. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner; beginning April 21st, open daily for dinner. Entrées $12-$40.) </p>

It’s not just the preserved lineaments of the renovated town house that it occupies; it’s also the well-spaced seating and eager-to-please staff, the warm, pea-green walls, and the unobtrusive yet oddball art. (One large painting shows a strapping young farmer, wearing a gimme cap, striking a pose before a silo.) </p><p data-wc="199" word_count="199">Although the chef, Bill Telepan, has long been a practitioner of seasonal cooking (his last restaurant, Judson Grill, closed in 2004), he wears his ideals lightly. The results are not uniformly excellent, but for every mediocre bit there’s something lively and unique. A quail appetizer was too drab to merit the unwieldy effort to strip the meat from the bone; the accompanying apple-duck sausage was flavorful but dry and crumbly. The black-truffle pierogi, on the other hand, had a bold flavor and a creamy texture, and the outstanding yellowtail tabbouleh consisted of sweet slabs of raw fish over chewy grains laced with cured tuna and mint. The entrées tended to tread safer paths, with less satisfactory results. The salmon—the waitress added, “I tell people right up front that it’s farmed, not wild, after that article about places that try to trick you”—was heavily breaded, and the chicken, while nicely roasted, was forgettable. Even here, though, there was compensation: the duck, served with foie-gras custard, was delicately indulgent. (At lunchtime, when the place loosens up a little, there’s a fine burger, accompanied by housemade pickles and a “volcano” of softly battered onion rings and fries.)</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">And so it went with dessert. A smooth peanut-butter-and-milk-chocolate gianduja was classically satisfying, but it arrived with an incongruous heap of huckleberry gelée, which didn’t quite pull off its presumed evocation of jelly. Still, the sensation of a coddled life persisted: as soon as one ventured from the table, a neatly suited server stepped up as a polite, perfectly discreet escort, and a parting gift of rich chocolate truffles arrived, already boxed up to go. (Open Wednesdays through Sundays for lunch and daily for dinner. Entrées $15.50-$36.)</p>

Navigating the menu, for the uninitiated, can be tough. Since the dishes are mix-and-match, like a liquid salad bar, there are many choices to be made, and, since the ordering is done cafeteria-style, they have to be made quickly so as not to antagonize those waiting in the (often long) line.</p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">Hong Kong Station’s motto is “The Taste of Hong Kong Here at Home.” The look is a neat amalgam of fast-food familiar (sleek logo, employees in matching polo shirts and bright-orange visors) and Chinatown exotic (cat statues, a pair of large, mysterious tongs hanging next to the toilet). The staff’s English is probably better than your Cantonese, but the result is not always total comprehension. The first step is to choose your noodles. There are nine kinds, seasoned according to preference, and ranging from the “thick noodle” to <em>lai fun</em>, a tightly coiled vermicelli that resembles Spanish moss. Toppings, a dollar apiece, include beef shin, chicken wings, fish patties, and an array of luncheon meats including Spam and hot dogs. It’s fun to submit to suggestions from the crowd, even if you end up with a six-buck bowl, fully loaded with extras you’re not sure you wanted. Curried fish balls, enthusiastically vouched for, lack heat and have the suspiciously dense texture of Chicken McNuggets. But pig’s feet, served on the bone, are a spicy treat, although they might be even better if you could eat them blindfolded.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">Most beloved is the “faux fin soup,” made with filaments of pork and mushroom instead of shark fin.“When I was little,” a young woman sitting near the counter, who explained that she was from Hong Kong, said, “I’d save my spare change to get a bowl off the street.” She poured a bit of her drink, made with black-currant juice and lemon, into a plastic ramekin. “Try this.” Like her inclination to share, it was very sweet.

A later entry to the hotel’s dining options, Peacock Alley has had several top chefs since it opened in 1961, including Laurent Gras, whose terrific menu was so eccentric that he retreated to California for three years after the Waldorf closed the place, in 2001. The management’s idea for a revamp was to demolish the ovoid room lined with peacock murals; the restaurant, which reopened last November, is now part of the Art Deco lobby. One recent evening, an old gent wearing a raincoat over his tweed suit sat in a club chair reading the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, folded back and held close as if he were on a crowded subway. A woman played what sounded like a ragtime arrangement of “Desperado” on a grand piano. Among the jabbering hotel guests, someone in a tuxedo asked for directions to the rest rooms. With all the racket, it might as well have been a Greyhound-station waiting room.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">The distractions are unfortunate, because the new chef, Cedric Tovar, serves food that merits undivided attention. There are pointed notes of invention, like the poached egg and black truffle, which comes as a bubbling foam in a miniature Le Creuset saucepan, and Belon oysters, studded with black pepper and green apple. Then there’s the deep pleasure of the braised pork cheeks with <em>garganelli</em> pasta and a <em>guanciale</em>-and-Parmesan emulsion. The menu features only one duck, but it’s a fine specimen from Long Island, served with braised baby turnips. Some entrées emphasize hearty proportions over innovation but make up for it with a provocative side dish. The aged sirloin, for example, is married to both a short-rib compote and a cauliflower-and-bone-marrow salad. </p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">However noisy the lobby, the restaurant manages to preserve a sense of unhurriedness. Dinner stretched to two and half hours—the esoteric list of dessert wines by the glass and a quark cheesecake with a gingerbread crust were worth lingering over. Meanwhile, the old guy was still in his chair folding his way through the financial tables. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for dinner. Entrées $26-$38.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/02/27/yakitori-totto	YAKITORI TOTTO	251 W. 55th St. 	41.5755180833333	-90.5740235595238	212-245-4555	2006/02/27	<p data-wc="145" word_count="145">With bird flu inching toward us and more than a million Americans falling victim to salmonella each year, this might not seem like the smartest time to eat raw chicken. Still, unless this bustling little yakitori joint is playing a dangerous practical joke, chicken sashimi is a delicacy in Japan. Like many extreme foods, it turns out to be less dramatically weird than one secretly hoped. Something like yellowtail sashimi in appearance and texture, but with a flavor less distinctive than that of most raw fish, the raw chicken is best served with an accompaniment—a marvellously aggressive wasabi, chopped very coarse, or pickled plums that impart a smoky flavor. Non-Japanese diners are asked if they really want to eat it raw, but the staff’s friendly professionalism reassures one that, as with trapeze artists or brain surgeons, whatever they are doing must be safe.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Even once the chicken is cooked (yakitori means chicken grilled on a skewer), things stay strange. Yakitori Totto cooks the whole chicken, and then some: the skin (a crispy ribbon twirled round the skewer), the gizzard (improbably fibrous, almost like celery), the tail (a deliquescent dollop of fat that makes you forget to wonder if chickens actually have tails). More familiar areas of the chicken also make appearances—wings, thighs, breast—while a delicious chicken meatball, served with a raw egg to dunk it in, seems to be posing the riddle about which came first.</p><p data-wc="165" word_count="165">Yet the strangest thing on the menu is not chicken at all, but seaweed. Forget crispy fried <em>nori</em> or pliant <em>hijiki</em>: <em>mekabu</em> comes in a coating of—there’s no other word for it—goo. As one chews, it starts to expand, until suffocation starts to seem like a real possibility. Happily, there is plenty on the menu for even the most timid diner, such as enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon, fried pork dumplings, and delicate tempura silverfish with green-tea dipping powder. The place—up a flight of stairs from a row of Japanese restaurants—serves past midnight, but it’s advisable to arrive early, because the largely Japanese crowd quickly exhausts the scarcer cuts. Try as we might, we never got to sample “soft knee bone” (only two per chicken, after all) or the enigmatic “soft bone,” which, the waitress explained, requires three chickens per serving. Where was this bone? The waitress turned and pointed at her bottom. (Open daily for dinner. Dishes $1.50-$12.)</p>

But operating under the spectre of a dearly departed bistro doesn’t seem to bother Gutenbrunner. He’s practically begged for the comparison, given that he left the distinctive space—long zinc bar, vintage art and film posters—entirely intact. Perhaps he was hoping no one would even notice it was new. Before the restaurant opened, in early December, he widely proclaimed his intention to keep it “under the radar.” Other elements in this strategy were no phone number, no menus, and no reservations. A phone number and menus have since appeared (a wise decision, in the latter case, given the tongue-twisting German names of all the dishes; the waiters can sometimes barely stammer out the specials, much less an entire slate of items). </p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">But Blaue Gans also has an authentic sense of self, seemingly confirmed by the number of German-speaking diners. And even the English speakers get into it. With a word like <em>Schweinsbraten</em> (a rich, roasted pig’s belly), who can resist attempting to roll it off the tongue? These are mostly traditional offerings, like goulash and Wiener schnitzel, but the chef, Martin Pirker, who also spent time in Gutenbrunner’s kitchen at Wallsé, creates a bit of surprise in every dish. The <em>Räucherforelle</em> layers a frothy mixture of smoked trout, crème fraîche, and horseradish between delicate crêpes to make a slice of savory cake; a grilled-vegetable terrine is topped with a vibrant, intensely flavored jellied tomato. Entrées reinterpret the meaning of <em>Klassiker</em>—in the <em>Kavalierspitz</em>, the boiled beef has the perfect texture between tender and mushy, and the creamed spinach turns out to be a bowlful of addictively buttery, neon-green purée. </p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">The most pleasing discovery might be the dessert list. One night, it included <em>Kaiserschmarren</em> (“the Emperor’s pancakes”), a doughnut-like batter wrapped around rum-raisin filling and accompanied by a caramelized apple. “The legend goes that the dish was a chef’s mistake—a delicious mistake,” the waiter explained. But it’s the <em>Salzburger Nockerl</em>, a light soufflé, still warm from the oven, set over a pool of tart huckleberries, that banishes any lingering ghosts of restaurants past. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $18-$29.)</p>

The main event—meaning the hardest to get into—is the subterranean one. When it opened last summer, word had it that you had to enter the taquería, push past a door marked “employees only,” and walk down a grubby stairway to face the icy hostess, who, if she liked the look of you, would divulge an unlisted phone number that you could then, returning upstairs, dial in order to request a table. Perhaps you’d be invited back down and led through the kitchen to your table (neighborhood people were given the number in advance). This speakeasy phase didn’t last as long as the owners, including the night-club entrepreneur and designer Serge Becker, had intended. Within a couple of weeks, the rigmarole made the <em>Times</em> and La Esquina began its transition into regular restauranthood. But you still have to go through the kitchen and the secret door. </p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">In spite of the pretense, the place is hard to hate; the atmosphere is more congenial and subdued than you might expect, and whatever lingering umbrage the insecure diner may feel can be quickly ameliorated by tequila; there are shelves upon shelves of it, some six dozen flavors in all. Shots come on a wooden platter <em>vampiro</em>-style—with a snort of tomato juice. Once accustomed to the dusky light, you see that the space is basically an old barrel-vaulted storage cellar that’s been tidied up to resemble a kind of ersatz Mexico: tile frescos of hot rods and hotties, wallpaper promoting tag-team wrestlers, T-shirts commemorating the 1970 World Cup. </p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">And so it goes with the food. Unlike at some other newer Mexican places around town, it isn’t quite <em>auténtico</em>, but it has dash and comes in small enough portions to suggest attention. Ingredients are perceptible: the chipotle in the lump-crabmeat tostadas, the pickled onions in the pulled-pork taquitos, the flame that has charred the striped bass in the <em>pescado</em> taquitos. The poblano cheese and mayo on the grilled corn turn dainty eaters into kernel poachers; every cob gets picked clean, as though that might secure an invitation back. (Open daily for dinner.

A rich woman’s Ikea, with booze, it offers some sumptuous wares. There’s a squash-colored kettle ($220) and a shadow box full of beetles ($850); would they work with a French-country cupboard ($25,000)? Eaters, drinkers, and shoppers don’t always mingle, but occasionally someone kills three birds with one credit card. A very good customer, one evening, picked out a goatskin throw pillow ($280) before settling in the café part of the room. He pulled out an antique bentwood chair and used his purchase as a seat cushion.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">Nicole Farhi, a clothing designer and the owner of similar spots in London and, more recently, the Upper East Side, opened 202 in June. The food, like the goods, is both elegant and homey. At brunch on the weekends, mothers signal from the racks while husbands handle the strollers and tuck into full English breakfasts. Bubble and squeak, an ample casserole of cabbage and potatoes, is like a starch pie, browned on the top and creamy underneath. Weekday lunches are a more civilized scene, popular with the sort of people who eat sandwiches with forks and linger over teacups of Vanilla Rooibos and Thunderbolt Darjeeling. The whole place, though, clears out at night. Perhaps it’s fear of drinking and buying, but missing the tuna burger—which, unlike most versions, never comes overcooked and is slathered with guacamole—would be the worse crime. </p><p data-wc="65" word_count="65">But even a menu this appealing is sometimes eclipsed by the retail element. The other day, a woman sat at the bar, leafing through a tabloid and picking at a tin can of Dole pineapple chunks. Maybe she’d blown her meal money on a set of buffalo-horn napkin rings ($75).

Members of the staff have a studied scruffiness that says they’re thinking about their bands, not their soap-opera auditions. The room has ceiling fans made up of what look like rotating desk fans, and the red walls, the enormous heaps of cilantro piled atop each dish, and the pencil holders of assorted chopsticks at each table give it color. Asked about the music, a waiter with a handlebar mustache who was wearing German Army surplus said, “Yeah, we keep it tame during the day. At night we bust out N.W.A. and the Dead Kennedys!” Despite the culture clash, the aggressive attitude is perfect for the food, a fearless combination of exotic chiles and unapologetic servings of fat.</p><p data-wc="234" word_count="234">Some things that sound the most outrageous provide only a momentary thrill, like the poached quail eggs topped with spicy fish and chile pastes and punctured so that they can be sucked out of their shells. More pleasing is the salad of fried pork belly and watermelon, dusted with sesame seeds and set on the pickled rind of the melon—a sweet and savory contrast that makes you long for humid weather. The chef, Zak Pelaccio, lived in Malaysia for a little more than a year, and his experience comes through in the more esoteric dishes. A look into the bowl of <em>Assam laksa</em>—rice noodles in a broth made sour with tamarind skins—reveals a hundred little fish eyes looking up at you. They belong to tiny anchovies called <em>ikan bilis,</em> which, if you ignore their plaintive stares, are a pleasure to crunch. The Fatty Duck—a small plate of brined, steamed, and fried pieces of duck served in a palm-sugar syrup studded with black peppercorns—is the best dish on the menu. A close second is the Dungeness crab, which is expensive, messy, exhausting, and wonderful. It comes with thick pieces of Pullman toast for mopping up the heavy, greasy chile sauce. It also comes with a Wet-Nap, but you’ll feel like taking a shower. (Open daily for lunch and dinner, and Thursdays through Saturdays until 4 <span class="smallcaps">a.m. </span>Entrées $6-$28.)</p>

Two decades later, she found herself in New York, working in marketing. Before long, she quit her job to open D’or Ahn, a chic spot in west Chelsea that makes French work—soufflé, mousse, vinaigrette—of such Korean materials as pickled pear, sesame leaf, and mung bean. (The chef Rachel Yang, an alumna of Ducasse and Per Se, put together the menu with the help of Ahn’s mother.) </p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">Like its proprietor, D’or Ahn has a rigorous approach that doesn’t stand in the way of some excellent impulses. Each dish has a declarative title. “Oyster,” for example, consists of mollusks on ice, daubed with <em>uni</em>, cucumber purée, and blazing-red kimchi. Served on a kidney-shaped plate, it resembles a painter’s palette. “Pork,” it turns out, is a composition in liquid: bits of quail egg and pig-cheek ravioli bobbing in a milky onion broth.</p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">The masterpiece of the menu is “Pork Belly,” a lardy glory. Braised with bean paste and heaped on top of millet risotto, it was being relished, the other night, by everyone from a man in a black beret to two guys from Holland. Ahn, in a Rochas pouf skirt, walked quickly from one end of the narrow room to the other, taking reservations on a cordless phone and stopping to make conversation. Her poles were a little Zen reflecting pool and a beribboned topiary.</p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">At D’or Ahn, the portions are tasteful, tasty, and tiny. Feeling spry after dinner, you might stay on at the bar, where the bartender pours Korea’s national spirit, <em>soju</em>, into a small glass that overflows into a surrounding pine moat: a shot in a box. If you do not know that <em>soju</em> means “burning liquor,” you could wake up feeling charred and wish that Ahn would find a way to Frenchify <em>hae-jang guk</em>, a traditional soup made with the internal organs of a cow that is said to cure hangovers.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/26/spigolo	Spigolo	1561 Second Ave., at 81st St. 	null	null	null	2005/12/26	<p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Spigolo is the kind of Italian place you might want to make your regular neighborhood spot—say, on a lazy Sunday evening, when you want something low-key, don’t want to cook, and are sick of takeout. But just try getting in! The place has only nine tables and a bar that can accommodate a mere handful of people, and it’s <em>molto popolare</em>. (<em>Spigolo</em>, by the way, means “corner” or “edge” in Italian, as in the edge of a table.) More and more in New York, it seems, reservations can be had only at the early-bird-special hours or the wee small hours, unless you happened to have had the foresight to book an eight o’clock table for 2005 back in the Eisenhower years.</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136"> 	The aesthetics of the place are not its strong suit—it’s generically homey, with exposed-brick walls and tediously genial framed prints. Scott and Heather Fratangelo, the young couple who opened Spigolo last February, live upstairs; he is the executive chef, and she is the hostess and pastry chef. (They met while both were working at the Union Square Café.) The food does not lack for color, though. A table of four expressed deep satisfaction with three shared starters: a heaping bowl of Prince Edward Island mussels in a garlicky saffron broth with smoked tomatoes; a generous tangle of braised octopus with tomato and chiles; and a lighthearted, vibrant marinated-beet salad with Gorgonzola crostini and mâche. But a salmon tartare with capers, parsley, sun-dried tomatoes, and cucumber, which sounded so refreshing, was almost unbearably salty.</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">	Much of the meal suffered from the same problem, with the notable exceptions of sheep’s-milk gnocchi, white, weightless clouds served with radicchio and pancetta, and <em>garganelli</em> pasta with a hearty, but not heavy, sweet fennel-sausage ragù. Of the second courses, the lamb stew made Friuli-style, with Swiss chard, Brussels sprouts, and polenta, seemed sure to be a ticket to the northern-Italian countryside and to mentally take us away from all this. It was not, and did not, nor did the good but unremarkable grilled strip steak. The restaurant’s special dessert is caramel <em>affogato</em> with <em>bomboloni</em>—coffee poured over gelato with a bunch of little doughnut holes. It is worth getting, just so you can say the word <em>bomboloni</em> out loud. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $22-$29.)</p>

As at Five Points, the popular NoHo restaurant that the chef Marc Meyer, his wife, Vicki Freeman, and their partner, Chris Paraskevaides, also own, the vestibule at this far-west Chelsea spot quickly fills up with a jostling, crankily hungry crowd. The dining room itself looks spacious, with high ceilings and large plate-glass windows, but the tables are tightly crammed together—pity the fleet of servers, who must negotiate not only tables, elbows, and bags but also each other. One recent evening, a request to omit an ingredient was met with a sigh. “The chef gets frustrated because he feels it compromises the dish,” the waiter explained. “But he’ll do it.”</p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">These less than welcoming moments are forgivable, though, given the often terrific food they accompany. Each taste can become a game of “What’s that flavor?” as equal measures of sweet and spice grapple for attention. The bread basket arrives with a generous crock of crème fraîche, blended with horseradish and caramelized onions; the excellent duck <em>taquitos</em>, tiny tubes of shredded fowl surrounded by a crunchy, fresh corn tortilla, have a faint chile heat and the warm glow of cardamom. But even the more straightforward preparations have a dense complexity. A bluefish appetizer is arranged with the almost overripe lushness of a Flemish still-life; the smoked fish is nicely offset by arugula and grapes. The roasted baby chicken is tender and juicy, and the grilled pork loin and link are both traditional (with an accompaniment of braised cabbage) and surprising (with the topping of a smoked-pear mustard). </p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">Although the entrées are enormous—nearly the size of two main courses at other restaurants—it’d be a shame to miss dessert, especially the flaky pastry turnovers encasing a rum-spiked date filling or the airy bread pudding. These would be pleasant to linger over, with a coffee or one of the unusual teas, were it not for the feeling that Cookshop has another type of turnover in mind. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

While the menu at A.O.C. Bedford abounds in such ingredients, and with their Spanish equivalents, labelled D.O. for <em>denominación de origen</em>, the restaurant’s name has a fussier vibe than the place itself, a snug bistro tucked away in the Village. The small room is so cozy that you expect an open fire; instead, red painted walls, patches of exposed brick, and lowish ceilings with wooden beams are suffused by candlelight.</p><p data-wc="161" word_count="161">While the cooking here is on the ambitious side, many of the most successful dishes have a hearty simplicity. A rich pumpkin soup contains thick strands of sautéed onion, and the outstanding gnocchi come in a sauce of Cabrales cheese, browned on top. A signature dish is suckling pig, a loin with succulent, crispy skin. This is one of several dishes that are plated or prepared at one’s table. Such rituals can often seem perfunctory and embarrassing, but here, despite the tiny space, the staff conveys real enjoyment. But subtler flavors on the menu could sometimes be more imaginatively handled. An artichoke salad was unmemorable and a dish insouciantly billed as “Lettuce” turned out to be a straightforward Caesar salad. One exception, though, is the artful octopus-carpaccio appetizer. Consisting of delicate tentacles sliced in cross-section a few microns thick, drizzled with olive oil, and spread in a wide circle, this spectacular dish has the mottled appearance of antique marble.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">Desserts vary, but it’s a fair bet that there will be a tarte Tatin—the apples have a fine dark, caramelized flavor, but the pastry ought to be more delicate—and a crème brûlée that is blowtorched before one’s eyes. The invariable specialty of the house, however, is a gorgeous crèpe Suzette. This, too, is prepared tableside, so that as the evening progresses, the restaurant gradually fills with the smell of butter and orange. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $20-$32.)</p>

Scholars have failed to turn up the combination’s origins, but Joseph Wells, the proprietor of the now defunct Wells’ Restaurant, in Harlem, claimed, somewhat audaciously, that credit belongs to the jazz musicians and clubgoers who would come to his place so late that they couldn’t decide whether it was morning or night. Melba Wilson endorses this version; to her, chicken and waffles is a Harlem thing. Wilson is soul-food royalty—a niece of Sylvia Woods, the proprietor of Sylvia’s. After a failed attempt a few years ago to revive the famed jazz club Minton’s, Wilson finally has a place to which to affix her own name, in the booming area east of Morningside Park.</p><p data-wc="145" word_count="145">Wilson prefers the term “comfort food” for her fare, both because it deviates from certain orthodoxies (her collard greens are flavored with smoked turkey, rather than pork) and because she likes to think that a sublime plate of braised short ribs or macaroni and cheese has nothing to do with the color of your skin. She calls her appetizers “comfortizers,” an apt designation for the spinach-and-cheese empanadas and for the mini-cheeseburgers, two to a plate, taller than they are wide. The entrées are likewise built for comfort and not for speed. As for the chicken and waffles, the highlight, besides the mere act of asking for them, is peeling off the fried batter with your fingers and sopping it in syrup. The only drawback is that this can’t be done at five in the morning: the kitchen at Melba’s closes around eleven.</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">Melba’s down-home touches are few, and are either subtle (diners can sit in church pews, from the New Mount Zion Baptist Church, on 140th Street) or spontaneous. On a recent evening, as a waiter brought in a becandled slice of sweet-potato pie for a sheepish-looking young man, the woman who was sitting with him broke into a fork-stopping gospel rendition of “Happy Birthday.” When she was done singing, Wilson came over and said, amid sincere applause, “Natasha, you gotta give us something else.” She did, and it was comfortizing.

The ovens inside the van’s fifty-square-foot galley are hot, having been fired up before he left Vinny Vincenz, a pizzeria on First Avenue and Fourteenth Street, where the dough is laid out. Once he’s parked, Lynch spreads the shredded mozzarella and cooked red sauce and slams the square pan into the top oven. Though the herbed sauce is the owner’s secret family recipe and the crust is always as nice and thin at the downtown store, slices seem better from the truck. It might be the high turnover, or Lynch’s touch and timing—he says he knows by smell when the pie is done—but it’s among the best in midtown. And it is nearly as good as what you can find at the sacred halls of the pizza hounds. “L &amp; B Spumoni is my place in Bensonhurst,” he says. “That’s where God goes for pizza.”</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">Lynch has been, among other things, the drummer for the band Yuppicide, an assistant to the artist Peter Max, and a chef de cuisine in the basement of CBGB. During the nine months that his pizza truck has been jockeying for position on this corner, he has befriended the halal-cart guy across the street, the pretty subway worker who gives him change, and the neighborhood cops. He knows that some people are reluctant to buy food off a truck and worries that the Department of Health might raid him at any moment, so he’s vigilant about following the health codes. Customers are offered an encouraging “Excellent choice!” when they order, although there’s only Sicilian, with no toppings (it’s possible he’ll have enough chicken or meatballs for a couple of parmigiana sandwiches).</p><p data-wc="65" word_count="65">One recent afternoon, a blue moving truck hit the brakes partway through its turn onto West Fortieth. “One slice! One slice!” one of the three men inside wearing blue coveralls yelled. For a minute, the intersection was frozen while the driver passed money across his co-workers and they passed the slice back—as smooth as a ballpark-bleacher transaction. (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch. Slices $2.)</p>

After the waiter’s schoolteacher tone, prosciutto and figs, with velvety ribbons of meat swaddling the pink fruit, seemed best enjoyed as finger food.</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">Frank Crispo, who opened the restaurant three years ago after two decades in various New York kitchens, has a reputation as a chef’s chef, but here he’s put together a menu that will appeal to everybody (Crispo’s policy of keeping entrées under twenty dollars helps the cause). The <em>stricci</em>, a dish of triangular ravioli sealed and striated with the prongs of a fork, was stuffed with butternut squash and had an earthy sweetness. The whole branzino was served with a cipolline onion at the throat, while the hanger steak balanced the delicate flavor of a red-wine reduction with its own savory jus. And potato croquettes—buttery, upscale tater tots—redeemed a bland veal <em>medaglione</em>. The only off note was bananas flambé, which arrived on a doily and tasted fermented, like banana wine.</p><p data-wc="145" word_count="145">Crispo is meant to be an Italian trattoria, a point somewhat obscured by its décor of antique light fixtures, strung-up sausages, and photographs of waterfalls. (“Oh, the gentleman who lives next door took them in Brazil,” a hostess said.) Then there’s the neighborhood. Stuck between the West Village and Chelsea, Crispo, despite its sure-handed food, doesn’t seem like a place where anyone really wants to linger. On a Saturday night, the dining room was busy at 9, but almost empty at 10:30. The remaining group was pounding drinks and singing Bon Jovi, pretty loudly. “NYC will tow cars after 11 PM parked on 14th St. between 7th and 8th,” the menu warned, and the fingerprint motif that adorns the matchbooks and bill holders began to look less like a stamp of character than a plea for identity. (Open every night for dinner. Entrées $17.50 to $19.50.)</p>

Some things turn out fine, like the challah-bread pudding with a thick dulce-de-leche sauce; others have a limited charm, like the deep-fried macaroni and cheese, a brick of crunchy pasta set in a plasticky pool of Velveeta, manchego, and cheddar. Then there’s the monstrous Mo Burger, a thick, juicy meat patty, topped by a fried egg and fried onions and sandwiched by two generous smears of chicken liver and a bulky, soft bun. It’s a valiant attempt to make sarcasm edible, but too overblown to really enjoy.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">Luckily, there’s also gimmick-free fare, including excellent straightforward burgers. The potato latkes stick to tradition, arriving with applesauce and sour cream. “They’re not my Aunt Debbie’s,” a diner remarked, “but they’re close.” A tender pork chop has a root-beer glaze with equal measures of sweet and salt. At times, though, the cooks seem to have lost their taste buds. Sautéed greens were far too garlicky; <em>chicharrones de pollo</em>, small, tough, and gristly chunks of chicken, had a fiery fried shell that overwhelmed their avocado salsa. And stuffed cabbage, a dish admittedly difficult to love, was drowned in a bland tomato sauce.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">The owners, brothers Phil and Jesse Hartman (who also own the Great Jones Café and the Two Boots pizzerias), obviously have tongue firmly in cheek—the restaurant’s name, according to their Web site, is a tribute to “an eccentric cousin who tried to assassinate Hitler,” and they serve a Martini called the Manischevetini. (Perhaps the comedian Jimmy Fallon, one of their investors, had a hand in the menu.) The chef, Chris Randell, came from a stint at Dos Caminos, which explains the Latino fusion. The crowds will keep coming for the talent upstairs—performers have included Debbie Harry, Lili Taylor, and Amy Poehler—but one hopes that Mo Pitkin’s will give up some of the party tricks and concentrate on the diner standards it does so well.

As it happens, Hamilton cooks eggs beautifully—delicately scrambled with frisée or poached and dropped in a hearty soup of Portuguese sausage and garlic—but they don’t dominate the menu any more than prunes dominate the menu at Prune, the tiny but successful restaurant where Hamilton used to cook.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">The cuisine is part American (brisket, succotash), part southern European (salt cod), and the menu is divided, Italian style, in three; the human stomach is really designed to fit only two of these courses, but each section has its temptations. Two particularly striking starters of late were a salad of watercress, sheep’s cheese, and lamb’s tongue sliced so thin that its texture seemed almost mushroomy and an adventurous cold almond soup. Of the second courses, a standout was octopus, grilled in typical Mediterranean style but served with pickled burdock root. (House-pickled vegetables line a shelf above the bar.) More puzzling were the ricotta dumplings—pale, floury, and tinged with lemon zest, they tasted like cake batter.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">Hamilton’s way with meat, as at the offal-rich Prune, tends to be extreme. The brisket with coffee-infused barbecue sauce was a huge hunk of beef, as tall as it was wide, marbled with fat and cooked to a tender consistency. Similar, but less successful, was the whole suckling pig with citrus glaze, which turned out to be a slightly mushy heap. Such calorie-laden heartiness can be welcome, especially with the onset of winter, but elsewhere Hamilton demonstrates a more interesting talent for subtle flavors and unusual combinations. A fillet of hake, for instance, was served in broth, with clams and fava beans, and the fish of the day, almost invariably Mediterranean bass, was grilled plain with only lime and a few herbs.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">Some things haven’t been ironed out yet. A very nice bottle of Rioja arrived at the table unaccountably cold one evening, and there can be a certain serenity to the service. But this is serious, adventurous cooking and it seems to be attracting a clientele to match. On recent nights, people at most tables were excitedly passing their plates around, making slightly self-conscious pronouncements on each dish. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner, and Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $16-$24.)</p>

A <em>very</em> little United Nations: not including daily and monthly specials, there are only five entrées and six appetizers (three hot, three cold) to choose from. (This being America, land of chubbos, there are five desserts.) </p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">The name of the restaurant is Japanese for “professional kitchen,” a translation that doesn’t exactly hit your ear like poetry and doesn’t create any expectations of culinary inspiration. Actually, almost everything on the menu sounds like a welcome surprise, and yet, upon arrival, disappoints. One thinks of fusion as a way to lighten the step of old-guard cuisine, but here the effect is a piling up of ingredients that, in many cases, don’t belong together. The yam coating on the sautéed striped bass, served with an apple-cider reduction and a celery-root purée, is more like a crunchy shell, overwhelming the fish underneath. An asparagus risotto is gummy and accompanied by a cloying slab of spinach lasagna. You leave feeling full but deflated, and possibly a little tense from worrying about knocking things over; the tables are small and made more so by the large wine and water glasses. Sharing requires you to snake your fork over to your partner’s plate with the care of a bomb defuser. </p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">The appetizers tend to be more appealing. (And before the appetizers there is a wonderfully garlicky crème-fraîche spread, spiked with chipotle and spinach, for dipping crostini into.) Four disk-shaped dumplings filled with braised pork cheek, sitting in a little puddle of butternut-squash purée, are light and sweet, and two tiny slices of pickled radish on top of each add a piquant touch. The pistachio-crusted oysters, held together with a band of seaweed, are a delight; it’s as if four frumpy fried clams were transformed by the magic wand of a fairy godmother.

Bruno’s goes late, serving food until 4 <span class="smallcaps">a</span>.<span class="smallcaps">m</span>., even as it morphs, via the removal of tablecloths, into a lounge. Tony Chi, Bruno’s designer, has said, “The place is about rubbing, being together.” A private dining room in the basement doubles as a surreptitious smoking area, where strangers congregate, rub, and exclaim, “You are very beautiful, let me tell you this.” </p><p data-wc="147" word_count="147">At 8 <span class="smallcaps">p</span>.<span class="smallcaps">m</span>. on a recent steamy evening, the place was deserted, save for a soul band setting up. “Where is everybody?” the captain was asked. “Don’t worry,” he replied. Sure enough, by 9:15, the patrons outnumbered the staff. More than one party consisted of a lone gray-haired gent and three or four young, or younger, women. “It’s like a professor and his students,” a diner remarked. “Except that those aren’t students.” One of the nonstudents, in tight pants and a floral halter top, explained, as she volunteered her number, that she had seven businesses and five cell phones (“I only answer one”). The band played “Love Train,” and a man who looked a bit like Dennis Farina, in a black T-shirt tucked into pleated linen pants, took a henna-haired companion for a whirl. The ambience felt vaguely Estonian, with a little Southampton thrown in.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">Amid such a spectacle, it would be easy to overlook the food—just so much fuel for the love train—were it not for the fact that it costs so much. The Dover sole (a rather wan slab) and the short ribs (a sweet heap) were passable, but not at forty-two and twenty-eight dollars a pop. That their accompanying sides don’t always arrive might be a good thing. There’s a gloopy little dish of flavorless gnocchi, some limp green beans: fit for a four-year-old, perhaps, but not for men who are presidents. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner.

But Steven Yee, a co-owner with Allen Leung and the chef, Judy Seto, is a longtime L.E.S. resident, and he considers the two-month-old spot part of a tradition of homegrown joints. At the end of the evening on a busy Friday night, Yee, who is garrulous and sociable, had settled at a table next to a lingering pair of diners. “We’re also opening a hot-dog place just around the corner,” he said. “I live in the area, and when it’s late at night and you’re hungry there’s only pizza and McDonald’s.” </p><p data-wc="171" word_count="171">Tides seeks a more discerning audience. The tiny room, which seats twenty-two, has a ceiling made up of more than a hundred and twenty thousand bamboo skewers arranged in an undulating pattern, and two booths are set into the wall at different heights, like a receding wave. A short but smartly curated wine list will change seasonally, along with the menu, which recently featured crispy and tender fried calamari and a sweet, rich corn pudding. The whole fish of the day was excellent: on one evening, a grilled striped sea bass, infused with rosemary and sage, and, on another visit, a golden, deep-fried tilapia. The lobster roll had a few weaknesses, like a too-thin sauce and a side of cold (though still tasty) sweet-potato fries. But its dill seasoning was refreshing, and the proportion of lobster to roll perfect. Even this staple of fish shacks alters to fit the weather: the dill has now made way for tarragon and cucumber, which will in turn cede to saffron-basil in the winter months. </p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">The desserts, a tart key-lime bar and a surprisingly light espresso brownie, are fine but mostly serve as an excuse to hang about the place for a few more minutes. The exceedingly friendly waitress might top off a drained glass of wine, and tables of strangers start chatting. As the hour gets later and the line outside dwindles away, Tides turns into a cozy little social club that any neighborhood could love. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

This earnest, weird little place is named for the arid part of Tuscany where Sergio Leone filmed his raw horse operas. Unfortunately, the owner, Cesare Casella, didn’t make use of Ennio Morricone’s whistling soundtracks, and the décor settles for mounted longhorns and a few travel-brochure photos. The burden of the theme is carried instead by the goofy names of the dishes—Earn-Your-Spurs, which is short ribs and grits, and the Sloppy Guiseppe, which is shredded pork and rib meat over pasta. But the cowboy gimmickry eventually yields to the sophisticated tone that Casella perfected at his other restaurant, Beppe.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">Every plate, small or large, comes with a great sprig of fresh herbs, and the fries have the most appealing combination: fried sage and oregano. There’s also a welcome carryover from Beppe in the bean sampler, a mix of heirloom beans simply dressed, like the creamy, giant brown-and-purple <em>fagioli diavoli.</em> A terrific piece of sautéed bluefish, with supercrisp skin, is listed as a small plate but could easily be a main course.</p><p data-wc="186" word_count="186">“About the Rocky Mountain oysters,” the waiter says discreetly. “I must point out that they are not really oysters. They are veal testicles.” They taste like the peppery batter they’ve been fried in, but the origin of their alias is apparent from the slippery texture inside. Tender grilled rabbit over a shredded-rabbit-and-radicchio coleslaw is, for once, an innovative rabbit preparation that works. One baffling item, Bordatino di Mare, looks like fish sticks but turns out to be baked seafood polenta with a too-hot dipping sauce.<br/> Maremma falls short in some of its entrées: the Tuscan steak is completely overwhelmed by its chili rub, and the trout, head split wide, suffers the same fate. The tuna could be meat loaf under a heavy tomato sauce. The best right now is the pappardelle with a wild boar sauce that has a hint of chocolate. Still, there’s an endearing quality to the whole operation. Casella has invented a cuisine most diners never wanted, and the fact that much of it shows promise should be commended.

Even the waiters fit the theme: swarthy, handsome, with windswept hair and black shirts unbuttoned just so. While the weather holds, the garden is a singularly inviting spot, sheltered by a latticework of greenery and enlivened by the trickling of a fountain. The table is laid with simple, rustic silverware, thick ceramic plates, and a dewy, chipped water pitcher. With such an overdose of atmospheric charm, even mediocre food would seem delightful. </p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">	The concession is rarely necessary. The platter of seafood tapas has a fine selection of variously prepared treats, from a passable mackerel seviche to the enormously pleasing shrimp-and-béchamel fritters. Grilled octopus comes perched atop a bed of celery, tomato, and onion, which gives the tender flesh a crunchy kick. Less successful are the whole grilled sardines, which arrive with heads and tails upturned inquisitively and with a deeply charred outer layer that has to be peeled away to get a few meagre bites of the tart, salty fish. </p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">	The entrées are more consistent, and the attention-grabber of the menu is the Niman Ranch rib eye for two, which comes on a great wooden slab, oozing juices—the seasoned crust is a bit overbearing, and the meat can be a little too marbled, but it’s still satisfying. And the kitchen can occasionally achieve brilliance, as it did one recent evening with a special of quail laid over risotto and port sauce. </p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">	The menu, refreshingly, doesn’t change much with the seasons; in fact, it’s hardly changed at all over the nearly five years the restaurant has perched on this stretch of gradually gentrifying Fifth Avenue. But then, the consistency of the menu is of a piece with the sense that, at Convivium, one can escape both time and place. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $13-$24; $70 for the rib eye.)</p>

Floor-to-ceiling shelves all around the room display nearly a thousand bottles—not just brandy (though there are more than four hundred of those) but also Scotch, bourbon, rum, Calvados, vodka, and others. An enormous copper alembic stands just inside the door, and the bathrooms are lined with woodcuts depicting distillation throughout history. The décor is masculine and clubby, with low lighting, tawny walnut finishes, tawny leather sofas, and pretty waitresses (known as librarians) swishing back and forth in tawny satin dresses. The visual effect is roughly like being inside a bottle of whiskey.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">Though the underlying idea of Brandy Library seems a little on the tacky side, the execution is excellent. The owner, Flavien Desoblin, and his spirit sommelier, Ethan Kelly, have amassed a serious collection of vintages stretching back to the beginning of the last century, and their employees display a commitment to the cause of spirits that borders on the fanatical. One evening in August, a librarian hobbled in on crutches, having been hit by a cab while on a trip to Irish distilleries. The staff might demur at the value of Macallan’s stratospherically priced “replica” of an 1861 vintage, instead pointing out the virtues of recherché independent bottlings from the seventies. They are equally enthusiastic if you just ask for Jack on the rocks.</p><p data-wc="140" word_count="140">Obviously, no one comes here to eat, but Brandy Library has a nice line of upscale finger food. The menu has Wall Street scrawled all over it—foie-gras this, caviar that—but it also has innovative takes on old favorites, such as bite-size burgers or “lambs in a blanket,” merguez swaddled in puff pastry and harissa. The fine cheese selection comes from Artisanal and is served with fruit compotes, which are house made, as are the desserts. The clientele is a heterogeneous bunch of financial-district people, some Tribeca strays, and a few awkward dates, but the place is at its best on a quiet night, when the librarians pour themselves shots, striving to educate themselves further, and the barman discourses on the great barmen of history and their fanciful creations.

He knows that, hidden behind the floor-to-ceiling curtain, down a short and narrow hallway, is a sanctuary of well-apportioned grease that will satisfy whatever burger daydreams have been nagging him since breakfast. But the line leading into it, spilling into the lobby, indicates a half-hour wait, which is an awfully long time to hold out for something that lasts less than two minutes.</p><p data-wc="51" word_count="51">	To wait or not? Burger people tend to be impatient, and there’s a diner down the street. They are also adaptable: once they’ve experienced the simple bliss of a Joint burger, they will learn to rearrange their days around it. Lunch can certainly be taken at eleven or three.</p><p data-wc="197" word_count="197">	The Burger Joint has occupied its little nook in the lobby for three years now, and is not much of a secret, but it can still feel like one. The space consists of a few tables and booths with graffiti carved into them, faux-wood panelling, movie posters, and a counter, behind which four or five harried souls sling burgers, fries, and nothing else—except soda, beer, milkshakes (after 1:30), and big cakey brownies, which you fetch for yourself and come to regret. The service is rudimentary, even rude, as is often the case when things are popular and cheap. The fries, which are only O.K., come in a brown paper bag, grease soaking through—an instance of how the place’s crudeness can seem pretentious. The burgers are wrapped in paper and served their way, not yours; you may ask for customized fixings, but you’ll just as likely get the works—lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, mustard, ketchup, mayo. They are not huge. But they are right. A Texan, tasting one for the first time, declared, “It’s like a pool-house burger!,” which apparently are words of high praise.

Unlike the tarted-up V Steakhouse, at the Time Warner Center, Perry St is more spartan. There are no colors, no curves, and only eight entrées to choose from. And the best items, barely two months after opening, are the ones for which Vongerichten acts as a kind of curator of summer flavors.</p><p data-wc="78" word_count="78">Recent appetizers are inspired by the farmer’s market. The heirloom tomatoes, paired with superior house-made mozzarella, were garnished with celery leaves and red-wine vinaigrette. There was a wonderful warm pickled peach with goat cheese on a frisée salad, and a savory dill broth over baby carrots and radishes. The forty-dollar starter of osetra caviar generously mounded over a slab of gently warmed hamachi was less local but still more a matter of careful placement than cooking.</p><p data-wc="88" word_count="88">The entrées involve greater effort from the kitchen, and the results are mixed. A bowl of fresh-squeezed cherry-tomato juice has a stunning flavor that nearly justifies the only passable piece of Arctic char that it accompanies. The rack of lamb has a velvet texture that contrasts nicely with a crust of chile-spiced bread crumbs. But the rabbit meat poached and packed into a cylinder coated in crispy <em>panko</em> is disconcertingly odd, and its flavors of Japanese citrus chili and a soybean purée only make it worse.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">Vongerichten, who often pads around the dining room in a chef’s coat over pin-striped suit pants and very supple-looking loafers, plans to change his menu with the seasons. It will be interesting to see what he does with winter’s abundance of turnips. But he ought to start over with the dessert menu, which, aside from a perky combination of poached cherries with pistachios and pistachio ice cream, includes some dull chocolate pudding and a wan cheesecake with what taste like maraschino strawberries. One evening a diner on his way out whispered a warning, “Don’t get the doughnuts!” (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $22-$38.)</p>

Turns out gin and milk <em>do</em> go together. (Turns out vodka and rosemary, in the Martini-like Rosmarino, do not.) A delightfully peppery freshness comes from a little plate of cut radishes, laced with anchovy purée and olive oil, that appears with the drinks. </p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">The cover of the menu features a grainy, stylized image of Anita Ekberg from “La Dolce Vita,” but the place evokes neither the scarcities nor the excesses of postwar Rome, except for the lovely, very long mirrored bar. An insanely large and unattractive modern chandelier hangs in the front room like a rhinestone-encrusted spaceship, and the metal room dividers with geometric cutouts call to mind suburban Chinese restaurants of the nineteen-sixties. Two warnings: don’t fall down the yawning staircase in the middle of the front room, and don’t sit at the oval tables in the back room, which are the wrong shape for the banquettes around them. </p><p data-wc="185" word_count="185">Gusto opened in the spring, and its chef, Jody Williams, late of Tappo and Giorgione, has set out to cover the waterfront—and Piedmont, Liguria, and other regions of Italy as well. Two good starters, chilled green-tomato soup and a crunchy, lightly lemony fritto misto, picked up where the radishes left off but were followed by much less snappy main courses. The wideranging choices feel overly strenuous, as if Williams were literally spinning plates, and the skittishness extends to the wait staff, many of whom don’t appear to be comfortable talking about food. The rack of lamb was nothing special; neither were Sicilian meatballs, with pine nuts and raisins.<em> </em>Tagliatelle alla Bolognese happens to be one of the tastiest things here, while Baccalà alla Vesuviana, house-cured salt cod in a tomato sauce with orange zest and chiles, is a nice discovery. The desserts are run of the mill, and there are, oddly, eight teas. Eight teas, in an Italian restaurant? Gusto has a chef; now it needs an editor.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/08/29/mercadito	Mercadito	179 Avenue B, between 11th and 12th Sts. 	null	null	null	2005/08/29	<p data-wc="150" word_count="150">“Three’s the perfect number,” a waitress at this East Village spot told a trio of diners recently. “That way you each get a taste.” She meant the diners, but she also meant the tacos, which come in daintily sized flights of three and are the prime attraction of the nearly year-old restaurant. The shareable portions and the long list of margaritas are also conducive to larger festive gatherings, a point seemingly not lost on organizers of bachelorette parties. One sweaty summer evening, the front room was packed with women in tank tops and men with shirtsleeves rolled up and shot glasses of tequila at hand. If you can make it through the crowd and negotiate the narrow hallway by the kitchen, the back dining area provides a cooler, slightly less raucous refuge. There are adobe walls, a thatched roof, and windows that look out onto a lushly overgrown backyard. </p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">Ordering is preceded by a lengthy disquisition from the waiter or waitress. It’s delivered pleasantly, but given the ubiquity of tapas-style dining it seems unnecessary; the idea could be distilled into “Get a little of everything.” The chef and co-owner, Patricio Sandoval, has set out to reproduce the flavors of a Mexican marketplace (the restaurant’s name means “little market”). The guacamoles—traditional, mango, and pineapple—are piquant and addictive; seviches, light and fresh, are served with excellent house-made saltines. Wild-bass seviche, made with strawberries, has a vivid sweetness that is complemented nicely by the spicy tuna, marinated in a chile-chipotle broth. The tacos range from the uninspired (the chicken mole is overwhelmed by a thick, almost cloying sauce) to the superb (the tuna is rich and smoky, while the shrimp taco, served with avocado and a garlic-chipotle mojo, is appealingly simple). </p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Sandoval recently opened a new outpost, Mercadito Grove, at Grove Street and Seventh Avenue, offering the same menu and the same margaritas. It’s a tiny wedge of a spot, with a few cramped tables inside and a more expansive sidewalk café outside. The tacos and seviches are in as fine a form here as at the original, but some of the atmosphere dissipates in the subway rumble and traffic heat of the busy avenue.

There's little to complain about, but not much that will transport you, especially on the steak end of the menu, where lightly seasoned slabs of beef are excellently turned out but hardly exceptional. And there are moments when the branding impulse becomes distracting. The menu urges the purchase of either an autographed copy of “Go Fish,” Tourondel's seafood cookbook ($34), or a bottle of BLT Steak sauce ($9); the wine list includes a glass of BLT cuvée. </p><p data-wc="159" word_count="159">Still, the roaring-eighties atmosphere is fun and casual, with suit jackets flung over the backs of chairs and ties loosened, and there are a few notable red-meat moments. Tourondel offers a version of the B.L.T., with the addition of American Kobe beef (the real stuff, from Japan, has been banned in the U.S.) and foie gras, and a Kobe rib eye prepared with a sea-salt crust has a smoky allure. But the standouts on the menu are piscine. There's a light, refreshing lobster salad and a rosy tuna tartare balanced on a base of avocado and served with house-made potato chips. One evening, a special of halibut was served with a feathery brioche topping and intense, flavorful tomato water. The wallet-lightening sides and vegetables are mostly uninspired, including pasty blue-cheese tater tots. “It doesn't taste like food,” one diner observed. “I can't tell if it's good or bad—it's just weird.” </p><p data-wc="50" word_count="50">Desserts here are prominently displayed on a sidebar as enticement and are difficult to pass up. The white-peach cobbler is dewy and fresh, with a buttery, crunchy oatmeal crust. The sundaes, though, might be considered the place's mascot: excessive, indulgent, and forgettable.

Although the restaurant’s name is derived from the A train—its logo is painted on a circular front window—the closest stop is several blocks away. Perhaps this is a ploy to keep people from finding the place, which tries to feed twenty-four in a mere two hundred square feet and is consequently always full. The kitchen is separated from the diners by a shower curtain, and the menu of French-Caribbean food is prepared with one burner and two convection ovens.</p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">A’s size determines almost everything about it, and the owners—Marc Solomon and his wife, Blue Grant—have thought creatively about what can be achieved in such quarters. A bring-your-own-bottle policy eliminates the need for wine storage, and the menu is minimal—usually about five appetizers, five entrées, and two desserts. The reliable delights of melted cheese are well represented in appetizers such as a hollowed-out Fuji apple filled with a Camembert fondue and finished with cinnamon, and a quail terrine with a Brie crust. The entrées taste more French than Caribbean—duck magret with guava was very like duck à l’orange, and none the worse for that—and although the cuisine ostensibly comes from the islands, until recently there were no seafood dishes. Vegetarian options are available, and they are inventively done, like everything else; on a sweltering July day, the chef replaced his usual coconut cassoulet with a chilled cucumber soup.</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">Inevitably, there are some compromises. The crème brûlée is made in advance—to wield a blowtorch here would be to risk singeing a guest’s hair—and so lacks crunch, and on a recent evening the restaurant had simply run out of coffee. But no one minded. Four and a half years old, A has a besotted SoHa following, and is so endearingly tiny that it’s impossible not to root for it. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner.

This isn’t one of those reclaimed opium dens or massage parlors but a glossy interloper with booths that dwarf the tallest diners, grating music, and a design scheme with a glass-fronted, ceiling-high wine rack and cylindrical glass chandeliers that seems better suited to SoHo. The Stanton Social has a tapas philosophy—small plates, meant for sharing, sent out in no particular order—but the ingredients are pulled from so many different cuisines that it can feel out of control. The menu offers little guidance other than three small boxes that mark off a raw bar that includes pristine oysters, caviar, and an optional shot of top-shelf vodka; a “slider” section featuring a noble little Kobe-beef hamburger; and an ill-conceived comeback, the Stanton Social Beef Wellington, a dish of filet mignon wrapped in foie gras and pastry and made soggy by its mushroom sauce. There are high points among the other offerings, but it’s hard to guess what will work together. </p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">There are pleasing choices, such as a pizza with figs and truffle honey and a nice enough wasabi-pea-crusted wild salmon. The Shanghai-style French-onion-soup-filled dumplings are an elegant innovation, served in escargot trays. But there are also oysters Rockefeller, which are fried and salted beyond recognition, and chipotle shrimp with a disconcerting salsa made with feta cheese. The tiny paella cakes were good—packed with lobster chorizo and artichoke, each one topped with a mussel—but the lamb shank’s presentation, a version of the do-it-yourself taco bar, is an exhausting complication. </p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">It’s better upstairs, away from the grim dining room, where the lounge décor makes it possible to think of the whole operation as a campy nineties theme bar. The maze of leather sofas and shared coffee tables is precarious (there seems to be glass breaking and silverware dropping constantly), but people are having fun and the music is nearly drowned out by the clamor of the flashy crowd. The food suddenly seems vindicated. Downstairs it’s the most annoying dinner menu in the world. Upstairs it’s the best bar menu of all time.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/25/alto	Alto	520 Madison Ave., at 53rd St. 	null	null	null	2005/07/25	<p data-wc="119" word_count="119">In many ways, this new restaurant is more like a secret temple than a mere eatery. The entrance is really on Fifty-third Street, just past a graffitied slab of the Berlin Wall. The dining room is sunk slightly below street level and windowless—instead, there are ceiling-high glass cases filled with wine bottles. And there are the reverent tones of the waiters and the ardor of the diners for the chef, Scott Conant, who got his start at restaurants like San Domenico and Chianti before moving on to his own place, L’Impero. “We’ve been following your career from the beginning,” a silver-haired woman informed Conant recently, as he took one of his regular turns around the place.</p><p data-wc="249" word_count="249">There’s also the slightest sense of déjà vu, from the cuisine (vaguely Germanic), the atmosphere (sombrely suited waitstaff toting domed dishes), and the sleek lines of the table settings, all of which one can also find a few blocks away at the Modern. Still, Conant has a deft touch for dishes that, if somewhat contrived in their complexity, are undeniably exquisite. Amuse-bouches set the tone: an oyster decked out in horseradish foam, crunchy apples, and red-beet vinegar and a silky almond gazpacho with muscat grapes and scallops were surprisingly subtle enticements. A soft polenta appetizer studded with snails, truffles, and asparagus spears was as delicate as it was earthy. Dishes that, on the page, seemed weighted by a cavalcade of luxurious elements—like raviolini filled with ricotta di bufala and accompanied by an asparagus-tarragon sauce, Pecorino, and a beef glacé—turned out to have an ethereal lightness. “It’s the essence of the sea,” a server whispered one evening, describing a sea-urchin foam, but one could apply the same formula elsewhere. <em>Strangolapreti</em>, a superb spinachinfused gnocchi, might be the essence of the potato, while a past offering of tagliatelle with cockscomb and tripe might be the essence of the farm. The desserts, created by Patti Jackson, are uniformly excellent: a recent offering of early cherries, served with a silky <em>biancomangiare</em>, a sweet frangipane, and a flaky almond croquant, inspired its own hosannas.

Now he’s after midtown—a location that, culturally anyway, is roughly halfway between the two. He initially considered a Latin theme but reverted to a less risky formula of American regional cuisine served in a French-bistro atmosphere. The room, designed with theatrical flair by David Rockwell, is dominated by a colossal zinc bar with a vertiginously tilted mirror, imported from Paris. Mixed drinks, including such recondite classics as the Bronx and the Sazerac (a New Orleans concoction of brandy and bitters considered by some to be the first-ever cocktail), are made to match the Deco décor.</p><p data-wc="148" word_count="148">The first thing that strikes you about the menu is its pitiless calorie count. True, there is a raw bar—on a recent evening, the most popular appetizer appeared to be a tomatillo-laced riff on the old shrimp cocktail—but once Flay actually cooks something it is transformed into a lethal, irresistible delivery device for cholesterol. This is a menu on which delicate squash blossoms appear only to be fried and stuffed with pulled pork. Other appetizers include shrimp and grits, which Flay embellishes with bacon fat, and a Vidalia-onion soup smothered in cheese. Among the entrées, there are simply presented, almost inhibited steaks—rib eye, shell, hanger, or filet—and a lacklustre seafood cioppino that tries to bridge the divide between a bouillabaisse and a gumbo. The skate wing, on the other hand, has a buttery delicacy that is offset perfectly by a crisp hominy cake. </p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">At the end of the meal, the lemon-meringue crème brûlée, a convincing hybrid, illustrates the restaurant’s habit of producing transcendent versions of old favorites. This tendency reaches its apotheosis with the house-made potato chips, which can be ordered as a side or with drinks at the bar. Accompanied by a miniature tureen of blue-cheese dipping sauce, they are, in their humble way, the greatest treat on the menu. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for dinner.

This episode, all but lost among modernism’s more prevalent creation myths, came to mind recently over lunch at Danny Meyer’s magnificent new place, in the renovated MOMA. Could it be that in this innocuous fender bender the seeds of the Modern were sown? Alsace, modernity, kitchen: these, anyway, are the base ingredients here. The chef, Gabriel Kreuther, has composed a capacious menu around the cuisine of his home region, although in such a way that suggests a head-on collision between his kitchen and a busload of fusion chefs. Consider the <em>baekeoffe,</em> an Alsatian meat stew, served in a little clay pot. Kreuther’s consists of lamb, conch, and tripe, an intimidating twist on surf and turf. Warped further by the aioli and cumin on the toast accompaniment, it is as disorienting as much of the art work housed in the galleries upstairs must have seemed in the days of horse-drawn kitchens. </p><p data-wc="178" word_count="178">The Modern is actually two restaurants, united by a spare, almost chilly design. One is a semi-frenetic bar café, with smaller servings, lower prices, and smoother skin. This is where you’ll find the <em>baekeoffe</em>. The other, on the far side of a frosted-glass wall, is a fancy joint with multi-star aspirations and an air, among the patrons, of art ownership. The view into the sculpture garden is occasionally modified by the sight of grandes dames arranging themselves into sculptural combinations—air kisses, motionless eyelids, hard hair. Meanwhile, delicate concoctions arrive under silver warmers. On a recent afternoon the chorizo-crusted cod narrowly edged the spice-crusted sturgeon and sautéed skate in a battle of the fishes, though in the wider aquatic category the truffle-crusted duck breast whomped them all. As Stein wrote in her play “Accents in Alsace. A Reasonable Tragedy”: “In the midst of our happiness we were very pleased.” (Bar Room open daily for lunch and dinner, entrées $12-$18; the Modern open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner, prix fixe $78.) </p>

The restaurant itself, though, is many years in the other direction—it’s an up-to-date Chinese fusion restaurant whose chef, Angelo Sosa, is a protégé of Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Though it’s only a couple of months old, it’s already a hit. If you walk in without a reservation, you are unlikely to find a seat at any of the ten tables, or even at the bar or the counter in front of the bustling open kitchen, unless you arrive at the gong of six, when the restaurant opens. </p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">The marinated Hawaiian jellyfish-salad appetizer may not beckon to many eaters, but it is a lovely, understated dish—more jelly than fish, it’s the kind of savory condiment that serves to get your appetite in gear. A bountiful number of plump, perfect, wok-turned Prince Edward Island mussels come with a generous amount of tangy, garlicky black-bean-and-seafood-sauce broth; the garnish of baby Thai basil and cilantro keeps the saltiness nicely in check. The seven entrées cover plenty of ground, from farm to sea, and the steamed yellowtail snapper, with remarkably tender flesh and pretty pink skin, is outstanding. The only disappointment is a side dish of green Shanghai shoots, which are similar to bok choy—they lie limply in an overwhelmingly saccharine sweet-and-spicy sauce.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">“Yumcha” means “drink tea” in Cantonese, and, when the weather is sizzling hot, you would be well advised to follow that directive and order a cooling green-tea Martini immediately—especially if you find yourself at the counter, where the microclimate tends toward the intemperate. The acoustically unfortunate space may, in fact, incite you to have several Greenteanis, if only to distract yourself from the deafening din, which forces dinnertime conversation to be conducted in a tone generally reserved for addressing cars that cut you off when you’re crossing the street.

No one knew. (The early hour was unusual; the dough normally lasts until ten.) One stymied couple stood outside. “This is the second time we’ve been here and they’ve been closed,” the man said, shaking his fist in defiance at the dark windows. </p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">Of course, there’s nothing more enticing in Manhattan than a restaurant that plays hard to get—and Una Pizza Napoletana is worth pursuing. The restaurant, which moved from Point Pleasant, New Jersey, to the East Village last October, has a wood-burning brick oven in back and a menu-cum-manifesto that puts its beliefs right up front: “Gas-fired and coal-fired ovens are not used now and never were used in the past to make pizza in Napoli,” it says. Blustery put-downs (“We have no quarrel with the man who sells cheaper pizza . . . he knows how much his is worth!”) and ungrammatical boasts (“Nothing more purer or honestly wholesome can be bought at any price”) follow. </p><p data-wc="156" word_count="156">Still, the proprietor, Anthony Mangieri, has earned his brashness. Una Pizza Napoletana’s odd hours reflect the care put into the dough, which is made from pure ground wheat berries, Sicilian sea salt, and water and rises twice over a two-day period. When the pizzas arrive, hot from their two-minute sojourn in the oven’s flames, the beautifully shaped ovals (individually sized and unsliced, Neapolitan style) have slightly charred edges and lightly laid toppings: buffalo mozzarella, San Marzano tomatoes, extra-virgin olive oil. (There are only four varieties to choose from, including a cheeseless Marinara and a tomatoless Bianca.) The dough is thin but never too crisp, sagging just a bit in the middle, where the intensely flavorful oil pools. After such a meal, it’s hard not to feel a little sorry for the late arrivals confronted by the “Closed” sign. But don’t worry: they’ll be back. (Open Thursdays through Sundays for dinner.

Oh, I love the country breakfast—eggs, biscuit, ham, so yummy.” Later, a young girl clutched the wrought-iron fence that stood between her and the window and stared in hungrily at the blueberry-stuffed pancakes and waffles smothered with fresh strawberries. </p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">The scene isn’t quite as frenzied at dinnertime, when the menu is a hit-or-miss mix of the gourmet and the comforting: recently there were spicy shrimp with unremarkable fried green tomatoes, tequila-marinated chicken wings, a tender fillet of Cajun-spiced salmon. A truffle-and-goat-cheese pizza, for all its ambition, felt contrived next to the simple pleasures of the sweet-potato fries. The onion rings make an encore appearance at dinner—airy and crisp, with tart tomato jam and a smooth lemon aioli—as do the pancakes, accompanied by addictively frothy, toffee-flavored maple butter. The homespun atmosphere is reaffirmed by a barrage of classic desserts, including  rich chocolate icebox cake and strawberry-rhubarb pie, a preview of summer under a golden lattice crust. An immensely appealing sundae, ice cream melting around a warm brownie, is topped off with hot fudge and whipped cream. </p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">Clinton Street’s culinary renaissance is old news by now; hip little restaurants are beginning to outnumber the bodegas and laundromats. Still, the neighborhood’s past—with its lines of washing hung out in tenement blocks—is sentimentally memorialized by black-and-white photographs that hang on the restaurant’s walls. Meanwhile, most of the tables are filled with self-consciously scruffy twenty-somethings who seem to be showing their sleek Connecticut mothers how civilized their new home can be.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/30/cru	Cru	24 Fifth Ave., at 9th St. 	null	null	null	2005/05/30	<p data-wc="69" word_count="69">Three key facts define Cru: its wine list is world class; its chef, Shea Gallante, is among the most gifted in the city; and its location, on the ground floor of a handsome apartment building a few blocks north of Washington Square, is notorious for the speed with which fine restaurants wither and die there, like exotic plants in unsuitable soil, a phenomenon that Cru seems uncomfortably aware of.</p><p data-wc="159" word_count="159">Cru has around sixty-five thousand bottles of wine and some thirty-five hundred selections, all drawn from the cellars of the owner, Roy Welland. In the sedate cocobolo-panelled dining room, serious men surrounded by decanters embark on elaborate tastings. Two thick volumes list bottles from three centuries (a jeroboam of 1899 Lafite-Rothschild costs $13,000) and even try for some enological puns—a 1970 Pétrus, for example, is priced at $1,970. (There are also plenty of excellent affordable offerings.) The Italian food created by Gallante, an alumnus of Bouley who was recently named one of the best newcomers in American cuisine by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>, is as impressive as the vintages. A meal begins with three sets of amuse-bouche: one evening, these included a tiny taco filled with subtle beet purée and a foam-strewn apricot mousse containing a stratum of balsamic-soaked tapioca. But the simpler dishes—tortelloni enclosing sweetbreads and lamb shoulder that is shredded with a feathery delicacy—may be even more memorable. </p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">Gallante has a thing for crudo (the neo-Italian riposte to sushi) and delights in lacing his raw fish with surprising, successful flavors. Langoustine comes in gin sauce, while blue mackerel is drizzled with chive oil. Unfortunately, the menu’s bias toward fish makes for a less than ideal accompaniment to the wines. Of the main courses, only the duck and pork dishes (both served in gratifying, hearty reductions) can really hold their own against the gigantic reds. Cru appears to have staked out a battlefield in order to avoid the fate of its predecessors, but it is the superb menu and unmatchable wine list that are at war with each other. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $37.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/23/landmarc	Landmarc	179 West Broadway, at Leonard St. 	null	null	null	2005/05/23	<p data-wc="122" word_count="122">Usually, when a waiter says, “Have you been here before?” it suggests that you are about to be baffled by a strange and complicated system for ordering and assembling a meal. At Landmarc, however, the question accompanies the presentation of the wine list, and the ensuing spiel brings good news, the upshot of which is that you get great wine on the cheap. Some bottles cost less than they would at a liquor store, and half bottles cost as much as a glass at many restaurants. Apparently, the low prices are a result of high volume (and vice versa, setting in motion a nifty feedback loop). You may feel as though your drinking were being subsidized—as though you’d gone semi-pro. </p><p data-wc="235" word_count="235">Marc Murphy, a veteran of many kitchens and genres, and his wife, Pamela, opened Landmarc last spring, in a two-story space that used to be occupied by the Independent, and it has developed a reputation as a friendly neighborhood joint, well suited to a Tribeca now in its prosperous, baby-stroller phase. (Other eras are represented across the street: there’s the Square Diner, a vestige of a more rugged past, and Buster’s Garage, an open-air sports bar, a portent of a more boisterous future.) The food is a comforting but not entirely unadventurous amalgam of bistro, trattoria, and steak house—onion soup, rigatoni, rib eye, roasted marrow bones. Its unpretentious presentation is an acknowledgement that there is only so much one can or should do to fix up, say, a pork chop (a heap of spinach and caramelized onions and apples does the job just fine). Simplicity, of course, can also be dull, and there are moments (bland bucatini, monochrome shrimp risotto) when you wonder why anyone bothers with the Italian chow at all. The grill master compensates for such shortcomings with his arsenal of filets mignons, merguez sausages, and veal kidneys, which he tends out in the open, at a grill by the bar. Desserts are three bucks apiece. For less than the price of a bottle of wine, you can have all six. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $12-$31.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/16/shake-shack	Shake Shack	Madison Square Park, at E. 23rd St. 	null	null	null	2005/05/16	<p data-wc="118" word_count="118">Since reopening for a second season last month, Danny Meyer’s snack stand has had nearly interminable lines, first stretching toward the temptation of a McDonald’s across Twenty-third Street and, recently, with the addition of a gate, in the direction of Sol LeWitt’s new installation, a kind of upside-down Stonehenge. Students from the School of Visual Arts sit cross-legged on the paths, sketching the scene. The Shack itself has corrugated sides of zinc and a sloping roof of ivy-tangled chain link, which forms a broad brim around the booth. Menu items are announced by cutout metal letters—done in Richard Neutra-inspired mid-century-modern cool—that wrap around the building. It’s drive-thru America recast as Manhattan elegance.</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">The Shack Burgers are the small West Coast, In-N-Out kind. The single patty is too thin to stand up to the grilled potato roll, the tomato, the American cheese, and the Shack Sauce (like all secret sauces, it tastes like Russian dressing). But the doubles and triples are pure messy pleasure, with dripping juices that encourage fast eating. And although the meat has a three-star pedigree—ground fresh from sirloin and brisket at Eleven Madison Park, the nearby restaurant also owned by Meyer—the best part is biting through each seared edge of the stacked patties. The rest of the menu is satisfying: hot dogs, including the unwieldy Chicago-style, and crisp, crinkle-cut fries. One nice oddity, the Shack Stack, adds a fried portobello mushroom to the double burger, giving a crunchy counterpoint to the tender meat. And the eponymous shakes are classic—thick, without any tricks.</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">The crowds keep coming, through fair weather and foul; but, while the ivy overhead provides some shade on sunny days, it does nothing for those hungry chumps who hang on through the rain. That might be for the best, because the Shack needs to get rid of some fans if it’s going to survive. No burger stand can handle this kind of volume. Even if you make it through the line, the wait at the pickup window can kill you. The only answer is to expand immediately—first stop, the sorrily provisioned Bryant Park. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Dogs and burgers $2.31-$7.60.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/09/sushi-of-gari	Sushi of Gari	402 E. 78th St. 	40.632644	-73.9126349	212-517-5340	2005/05/09	<p data-wc="200" word_count="200">There are at least a couple of ways to eat well in New York—at an impeccably designed, total-experience restaurant, or at a low-profile, chowhoundish eatery. For the past seven years, Masatoshi (Gari) Sugio’s establishment has belonged to the latter category, if in the worst-kept-secret kind of way. At Sushi of Gari, on the Upper East Side, Sugio holds court in the back corner of an unassuming space: white stucco walls, unflattering lighting, and flimsy tables. At the sushi bar, the waitress doesn’t even bother handing you a menu: “You want the Gari special, right?” You do. The best way to move through it is piece by luscious piece, although if you’re in a hurry, they’ll make up a ten-piece platter. Specially mixed soy sauce is at hand, but you’re better off without it, since Sugio’s sushi has already been carefully calibrated for optimal flavor. There’s marinated and seared cod and salmon topped with a crunchy fried tomato. Oyster casserole arrives in a heated shell, with rice nestled in behind the breaded, creamy shellfish. Sugio, blue-robed and rotund, jovially admonishes diners when they ask too many questions about what’s on their plate. </p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">Over on the West Side, Gari, which opened at 370 Columbus Avenue in January, has plate-glass windows looking out at the back of the Museum of Natural History and a gorgeous, expansive wooden sushi bar. At the tables, the chopsticks are adorned with a frilly ribbon, and the menus are stylishly translucent. Sugio’s signature sushi is still on offer, but entrées are given the star treatment: buttery, lightly spiced lobster, or a sweetly marinated sea bass. Maybe it’s the absence of the Master himself—chef duties fall mainly to his protégé, Mike Lim—but the sushi seems somehow paler, and the entrées, while satisfactory, are a bit boring. The clientele is elegant: women in fur and dapper men who politely pull out their chairs. But at Sushi of Gari, part of the charm is the convivial atmosphere, with families crammed around a table, businessmen with jackets off and sleeves rolled up, and Sugio leaning over to tell a joke. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner. Entrées $8.75-$65.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/02/applewood	Applewood	501 11th St., Brooklyn 	40.6657065	-73.9820545651354	718-768-2044	2005/05/02	<p data-wc="124" word_count="124">This Park Slope restaurant, on a quiet block midway between Prospect Park and the clamorous eateries of Fifth Avenue, gives the thirtysomethings who can afford to pay too much for apartments, strollers, and private school an aspirational neighborhood spot where they can spend their green freely and go green at the same time. Owned by David and Laura Shea (he is the chef, and she manages the restaurant), Applewood serves produce that is mostly locally grown and meat and poultry that are free of hormones and antibiotics. (In keeping with the close-to-nature ethos is the sight of Laura sailing between the clatter of the kitchen and the chatter of the front room with her six-month-old baby, Tatum, strapped to her front in a sling.)</p><p data-wc="104" word_count="104">A good way to start your meal is with a plate of four artisanal cheeses—each of the cheeses has so much snap and body that four people can easily share. A simple salad of greens is amplified by crunchy hazelnuts, dried cherries, and plump cloves of roasted garlic; garlic also plays a welcome role in the wild-mushroom ragout, which is surrounded by a little moat of mascarpone polenta. The waitresses—no waiters were in sight on a recent, busy Friday night; there is something chick-flicky about the place—can recommend a good wine to go with whatever you order, from a far-ranging list. </p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">Comfort food knows no season, and the potato-and-morel pavé is a dish you’ll want to snuggle with even as the weather is getting warmer. The earthy concoction is topped by a cascade of green spring peas; though it is saltier than it should be, it is delicious. The roasted lamb loin is a worthy choice, but have a detailed conversation with your waitress over definitions of doneness; the chef’s “medium” might well be your “too rare for me—can you take it back and cook it a little more?” The desserts, like the grapefruit brûlée with sparkling-wine sorbet, are fresh tasting and uplifting; the roasted apple slices come with a scoop of innocent-looking but heady juniper-berry ice cream. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner and Sundays for brunch. Entrées $18-$24.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/25/onera	Onera	222 W. 79th St. 	38.9850480821918	-94.5919665068493	212-873-0200	2005/04/25	<p data-wc="98" word_count="98">“Onera” is Greek for “dreams,” and the chef Michael Psilakis, a first-generation Greek-American who until last year ran an Italian restaurant on Long Island, has created a suitably imaginative compromise between his cultural and culinary heritages. Gone are such familiar standbys as dolmades, hummus, and charcoal-grilled fish. In their place there is a moussaka drizzled with truffle oil and a grilled loin of lamb whose sun-dried-tomato crust momentarily evokes veal pomodoro. Purists may balk at a dish like Manti “Reinvented”—which recasts the dumplings of Central Asia as, basically, chestnut ravioli—but Psilakis’s execution is uniformly impressive.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">The restaurant, which seats about fifty, is long, narrow, and just below street level; its décor (dark-blue walls, with white panelling and pilasters) has an understated elegance. The menu is large and complex, with, in addition to appetizers and entrées, a selection of raw meze. Scallops with yogurt, cucumber, and pickled fennel and lamb with Kalamata olives, arugula, and fried shallots are particularly good. And there are various tasting menus, including, infamously, one composed entirely of offal, which must be requested two days in advance. The calves’ brains, pan-seared, airy, and golden, are the highlight.</p><p data-wc="129" word_count="129">Greece has some three hundred indigenous varieties of grape, and among more than a hundred bottles on offer here are bold Agiorghitiko reds from Nemea, dry Assyrtiko whites from the volcanic island of Santorini, and a dessert wine that sounds like a goddess, Mavrodaphne of Patras. That old taverna favorite retsina has been banished to the by-the-glass list. On the dessert menu, an inventive series of rose-flavored dishes, including the inevitable Turkish delight and a surprisingly sophisticated miniature milkshake, is a winning creation. But although the tower of puff pastry and Marsala cream described as Baklava “Reinterpreted” is an impressive feat of engineering it’s unlikely to replace classic baklava anytime soon. (Open daily for dinner until May 1; thereafter, Tuesdays through Sundays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $14-$26.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/18/blt-fish	BLT Fish	21 W. 17th St. 	40.6601457692308	-74.1227750769231	212-691-8888	2005/04/18	<p data-wc="118" word_count="118">On the first floor of Laurent Tourondel’s latest venture, the white wainscoted walls are strung with thick rope and larded with antique rods and reels, stuffed marlin, and oars, giving it the feel of a Nantucket clam shack in August. The crowd dresses to match: as snow fell outside one night, three young women stripped down to tank tops to show off their winter tans, a dashing, sea-weathered man with salt-and-pepper hair ordered up flutes of champagne, and teen-agers in Andover crew hats shared baskets of spicy fried calamari. It’s boisterous and down-home, in an upscale kind of way: the generously chunky lobster roll comes in a red plastic basket, balanced on a white china plate. </p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">	It’s a bit jarring, then, to take the elevator up to the cool sophistication of the dining room, on the third floor (the second floor hosts private functions). Here, Tourondel has created what feels like a Nordic refuge, with sleek white lines and a ceiling entirely taken up by a stunning, retractable skylight. At the back wall, under bright lights in the open kitchen, diners can watch chefs in their <em>toques blanches</em> putting knives to scales. </p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">	In such minimalist surroundings, parts of the menu feel excessive: port-infused figs, caramelized walnuts, and a tart blue cheese overwhelm a sweet scallop salad. But the fish is superb. Served whole, for two, or in more modest fillets, they are brushed with olive oil and grilled, with sauces—tomato-tarragon mayonnaise or soy-citrus wasabi, among others—offered on the side. The whole Cantonese-style red snapper is more elaborate, arriving at the table propped upright and mouth agape, with a dorsal fin of vivid greens, perfectly crisp skin, and a sweetly spicy chile-plum-wine sauce. Some of the restaurant’s other whimsical touches are oddly out of place: the after-dinner glass jar of green-apple cotton candy seemed better suited to the carnival-like atmosphere downstairs. (First floor: open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for dinner. Entrées $14-$24. Dining room: open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $25-$35 per pound for whole fish.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/11/tony-lukes	Tony Luke’s	576 Ninth Ave. 	51.7436119	-1.193468	212-967-3055	2005/04/11	<p data-wc="170" word_count="170">Funny that, of all the regional cuisines to migrate to New York, the last should be that of South Philadelphia, where the cheesesteak is king—and not just king, but a large and unruly monarch. This is obstinately so at Tony Luke’s, near the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The cheesesteaks here are about a foot long, and they are served without the benefit of being cut in half. As a result, as you eat one, the structural integrity starts to go; well-cheesified clumps of steak ooze out the sides. Quick flanking bites along the roll’s perimeter don’t much help, and soon you find yourself pushing the thing into your mouth like a log into a chipper. In the brief period between the beginning and the end of this process, and in the moments immediately afterward, as you decimate a stack of napkins, you may conclude that there has never been a better sandwich, and you will pine for another. This is where the cheese fries come in.</p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">In Philly, Tony Luke’s has several outlets. The one here is a franchise, opened by Evan Stein, a Villanova native who spent two months last year living with Luke himself and apprenticing in the flagship stall, on East Oregon Avenue. Every ingredient is the same, down to the moderately tough rolls and the Liberty Bell deli paper. Stein even emulated the take-out setup: yellow fluorescent light, stool-and-counter layout, concrete floors resembling a sidewalk. Occasionally, there are authentic customers, too: expats in Eagles caps demanding hoagies “wit” (as in with onions) and wondering when Stein is going to start serving “breffis” (April 1).</p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">As for the cheesesteak particulars: at Tony Luke’s they don’t chop the meat. They sort of slice and scramble it. And they are not dogmatic about Cheez Whiz; you can go for finer stuff without shame. The irony is that the signature sandwich here isn’t the cheesesteak but the roast-pork Italian, a marvellous concoction of spicy roasted pork, sharp provolone, and broccoli rabe. The hint of bitterness is so peculiar that you can be excused, as you stuff it in lengthwise, for thinking that it is good for yiz. (Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Saturdays for lunch and dinner, and Sundays from noon to 6. Sandwiches $4.90-$7.35.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/04/v-steakhouse	V Steakhouse	10 Columbus Circle 	40.7685324	-73.9827662	212-823-9500	2005/04/04	<p data-wc="103" word_count="103">Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s latest establishment might just be Manhattan’s first embarrassing piece of Vegas backwash, complete with a Cirque du Soleil-style soundtrack, red velvet upholstered chairs, and gilded fake trees. The diners are expensively dressed, in an out-of-town way: one evening a woman in furry après-ski boots climbed into the lap of her date for an after-dinner make-out session, and the same night, during Christo’s spectacle in Central Park, a family dined in matching orange tops. (Although the restaurant claims to provide a view of the Park, most tables actually look into a physical therapist’s office across Sixtieth Street.) </p><p data-wc="171" word_count="171">Vongerichten’s idea of updating the classic American steak house is to simply ignore its conventions—including the quaint notion that the steak should be especially good. Recently, a rare order came out medium, while a medium rare came out medium gray. You won’t even want to send it back, since by this point in the meal you’ll already be looking forward to leaving. The single-serving, sixty-six-dollar porterhouse, nearly twenty dollars more expensive than the priciest steaks at the best steak houses in town, is depressing. There’s no crunch to the exterior, no juice to the interior, and no flavor at all. The Niman Ranch New York Strip steak is even odder, with the smooth texture of tofu. Other cuts of meat, such as the filet mignon and the veal-rib chop, are less offensive, but they still lack character. Among the many accompaniments offered—Vongerichten has maintained the traditional side-order shakedown—are something called Fripps, a bland tempura-battered slice of potato that the servers push with suspicious enthusiasm.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">There’s little consolation in other areas of the menu. An egg-roll-like pork appetizer arrived lumped in the bottom of an empty rocks glass. The exorbitantly priced shellfish plate recently featured desiccated oysters and lacklustre crab claws. And the gimmicky deconstructed lemon-meringue pie required more effort to eat than it was worth. If nothing else, diners will have the pleasure of knowing that their next meal, however humble or exalted, will taste terrific and seem like a bargain. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $19-$88.)</p>

The more glamorous dining room features spotlighted square banquettes and a shallow reflecting pool with floating candles, over which suspended orchids hover like butterflies. </p><p data-wc="163" word_count="163">	In such a setting, the food itself could have easily been an afterthought, but the chef Ian Chalermkittichai—who was lately the executive chef at Bangkok’s Spice Market—is as adept in the kitchen as he is at showmanship. Steel Thai characters mounted along one wall make clear his culinary ambitions, quoting a sixteenth-century poem written for a Thai king that promises heaven to anyone who tries the fiery curry. Chalermkittichai explains, “It’s, you know, orgasmic.” Recently, the seared foie gras was offset by a tart pineapple marmalade, and the sea bass, marinated in yellow salted beans, was succulent, if a bit cloying. Although much of the food seemed best for those with a sweet tooth, the sugar-glazed chicken lollipops—basically little boneless drumsticks—were also crunchy and spicy. Ending with dessert seems almost beside the point, and there are some missteps: the sweet tapioca pearls looked like pebbles from the bottom of the aquarium and tasted like canned fruit cocktail.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">For all the worldly airs, Kittichai’s staff—as gorgeous and attenuated as their fashionable customers—were oddly jittery. One evening, an eager waiter hovered just behind diners’ chairs, occasionally leaning in close to ask if everyone was comfortable. Perhaps he should have taken advantage of the bar’s excellent offerings—a few sips of the lemongrass-and-ginger cocktail could soothe even the most jagged nerves. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $14-$27.)</p>

By the time it closed, in 2003, that area, which includes Smith Street, had become the epicenter of Brooklyn dining. Now Ganic—once again in the vanguard of a burgeoning restaurant trend—has reopened close to the waterfront, a fifteen-minute walk from the old location. Unlike its somewhat dingy predecessor, here there are brushed saffron walls, stripy banquettes, high ceilings, and capacious windows. </p><p data-wc="182" word_count="182">The change of scene hasn’t affected the menu, much of which is replicated from the first Bouillabaisse. Among the appetizers, the pear, poached beetroot red and adorned with Gorgonzola, is an old friend whose return will delight many. But there’s a certain stodginess to the crab cake—perhaps the red-pepper aioli should be traded in for a note of citrus?—and one hopes that Ganic won’t forget to try new things. His signature dish comes in two versions, the first of which, “bouillabaisse,” is the more traditional, served in a saffron broth with dabs of rouille on large croutons at the edge of the dish. The other, “seafood combo,” puts the same assortment—lobster, mussels, shrimp, scallops—in a tomato-and-garlic broth. Ganic eschews distinctively strong fish tastes, and, rouille aside, the two dishes actually don’t seem all that different. The big surprise, given the restaurant’s name, is the uniform excellence of the meat dishes, which include coq au vin, pork tenderloin, and lamb shank, which mingles well with its accompanying potato mash and tangy, sweet red cabbage.</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">Desserts include a reliable chocolate cake, a disappointing crème brûlée (more crème than brûlée), and a bizarre rice pudding—lumpy and almost devoid of sugar or any other flavor—which Ganic is proud of the way some mothers are proud of ugly babies. Happily, there is a wonderful bread-and-butter pudding, rich in currants and graced with a raspberry reduction—perfect comfort food on a recent evening as the snow fell thick outside.

Like the neighborhood, Couvron has an appealingly motley heritage. Owned by the husband-and-wife team of Maura Jarach and the chef Tony Demes, it is named for the small town in Picardy where Jarach was born (she moved here, with her American parents, at the age of five). The couple ran a well-regarded restaurant of the same name in Portland, Oregon, for eight years but had an itch to get back to New York, and they opened Couvron last September. The place is not without its contradictions. Jarach doesn’t stand on ceremony, greeting you in jeans and a long-sleeved black T-shirt, as if she had just come from a poetry reading at the Ear Inn, around the corner, and yet Demes’s inventive menu is unambiguously high-end. The wine list, too, favors the kind of bottles that are out of reach for anyone working in a field in which the words “year-end bonus” are never heard. (Luckily, there is a wonderful and affordable selection of wines by the glass.)</p><p data-wc="177" word_count="177">Demes attended the Culinary Institute of America, and in the restaurant’s offerings there is evidence not just of France and Oregon but also of those classroom kitchens—there is a peacockish strut and splendor to the dishes, as if the chef is saying to his teachers, “Look what I can do!” A delicately sweet peekytoe-crab-salad appetizer incorporates small beet and pear cubes topped by a mad scientist’s cap of frisée; an earthier start to the meal is a creamy Hudson Valley foie gras on toasted brioche, with savory sauce and date purée. It is so rich that it almost has to be shared and so good that it should be. Some of the showmanship is less successful: the monkfish, which arrives shaped like a sushi roll and wrapped in bacon, is a little too firm for the arrangement, and doesn’t cut pleasingly. The flavors work beautifully, though. You probably won’t even notice the absence of salt and pepper shakers on the tables. (Open Tuesdays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $22-$34.)</p>

Whether dishes are organized by food group, animal habitat, or, as at Craft, method of preparation, eventually a plate of food comes, and you shovel it down. Still, gimmickry can concentrate the mind. At Lo Scalco, a new Italian place in Tribeca, eight categories of ingredient (artichoke, Dover sole, duck, etc.) are available in three courses: appetizer, pasta, and meat or fish. Frankly, everything looks promising on the page. To whittle it all down you might want to consider the Henry Ford approach: three people divvy up a category, so that one of you handles, say, the Dover-sole salad with string beans and walnuts, another the sole ravioli, and a third the roasted sole fillet. There’s also the Wade Boggs method: one person dines on sole, three courses of it, in all its guises. Or you can choose according to shape: create a “squiggly course,” consisting of the sole salad (the sole strips as twisty as cheese sticks), the sole ravioli (each <em>raviolo</em> like an adolescent albino eel), and—a surprise from the tomato department—an arrangement of three different pastas with sauces made from yellow, green, and red tomatoes.</p><p data-wc="184" word_count="184">Once you’ve got the menu management down, you can sit back and savor Lo Scalco’s manifest charms. First, the room, open and airy, with arching white beams and giant ceramic chandeliers—Kimberly Mafrici, the architect, is married to the chef, Mauro Mafrici (they are also the owners). Second, the sommelier, who strides the floor with a <em>taste-vin</em> (one of those fancy silver tasting bowls) hanging from her neck and dispenses dependable advice, melodious Italian label-readings, and declarations that stick with you for days: “With an amarone, it’s all about power.” And last, right there under your nose, the food. It is a pity that there is no twenty-four-course tasting menu (the max is six), because Mafrici’s variations on (and deviations from) the avowed ingredients can be astonishing. One wonders, turduckenishly, about the duck breast rolled with suckling pig. <em>Duckling brig?</em> When it arrives, under a white china dome, a clean jerk reveals a handsome specimen, a barnyard take on the jelly roll.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/28/tables-for-two-108	De Marco’s Pizzeria	null	null	null	null	2005/02/28	<p data-wc="102" word_count="102">Over the past few months, nervous anticipation has characterized discussions among pizza fiends about the quasi-expansion of Brooklyn’s legendary Di Fara’s into Manhattan. To begin with, there was the promise of pedigree—two of Domenico De Marco’s children are in on the new venture, although they were forbidden to import the forty-year-old business’s name. Last month, the pizza blog sliceny.com posted photographs from the two pizzerias taken the same afternoon, in order to compare the bottom-crust charring (Di Fara’s proved slightly blacker, but the bloggers admitted the test had no bearing on the crust’s crispness).</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">The good news is that the De Marco’s slice is nearly as good as Di Fara’s. It has the signature savory tomato sauce, like the one Domenico makes using herbs he grows in his shop windows, and each pie gets three kinds of cheese and a final drenching with olive oil before it hits the oven. But they’ve got some fundamental elements wrong. Domenico makes each pie fresh for customers, who watch as rapt as if it were sushi at Masa, pummelling a lump of dough into shape and futzing over the arrangement of mozzarella on top. At De Marco’s, the kitchen works ahead, stockpiling perfect circles of dough and reheating slices on demand. It takes its toll: the congealed cheese never tastes just right again, and the layering of flavors and textures in each bite becomes muted.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Even so, for the unobsessed, the thin-crust slices from the round pies will seem great. They are certainly a triumph compared with the rest of the pizzas. The square, thick-crust slices, a long-baked sacrament at Di Fara’s, are terrible at De Marco’s—they taste like focaccia smeared with Ragú. And, even more mysteriously, the whole pies, served in the depressing, airport-bar-like restaurant next door, aren’t half as good as the take-out slices. It’s no surprise that the Manhattan place lacks the dusty charm of Di Fara’s, where about the only addition in forty years is the vintage shortwave radio on the windowsill. De Marco’s may have the best slice in Manhattan, but it’s no substitute for the trip to Avenue J. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Slices $2.75; whole pies $18.50-$32.50.)</p>

There are just a few distinguishing touches, like a long communal oak table next to the windows and a deceptively hefty menu filled with blank pages. More important, the chef, Matt Weingarten, has eschewed his predecessor’s anything-and-everything credo, which had pad Thai vying with steak and eggs, in favor of a carefully minimalist selection.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Appetizers are generously portioned, and one could be happy making a meal of them. There’s roasted cauliflower, set in a pool of walnut pesto and accompanied by tart cherries soaked in port, and sweet-lettuce soup spiked by pleasantly chewy lemon tapioca pearls. The real star is the dish of parchment-roasted mushrooms, served in a puffed-up packet and opened tableside. One evening the scissor-wielding waiter leaned briefly over the fragrant steam and grinned. “It’s so much fun, we fight over who gets to do it,” he said. They’re buttery, herbed, and woodsy, and just as good on their own as they are wrapped in the chestnut crêpes that accompany them.</p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">The entrées aren’t quite so assiduously complex. A waiter mumbled a bit when asked to describe the <em>fumet</em> that accompanied the salmon recently. “Um, it’s kind of smoky,” he said. It came to the table in a visually stunning arrangement—pink fish flesh set in an inky sauce—but the flavor was wan. Better was the rotolo, a rolled pasta available in either a half or full-size portion and filled with ricotta cheese and savory roasted tomatoes. After all this, dessert seems to be an excess that the modest Porcupine can hardly countenance. One evening, the waiter gingerly set down a dessert menu, murmuring apologies for the presumption, and the selection was spare. The flaky ricotta-and-chocolate torte, though, proved too great a temptation. When less is more, sometimes you just want more.

Perhaps it’s the legacy of Babbo, where Nusser spent five years and where tripe and sweetbreads are so common that they are scarcely worth mentioning. But even the most jaded thrill-seeker will be impressed by the cockscombs at Casa Mono. Their texture—halfway between osso buco and jello—might put off some diners, but the persuasive preparation, a rich reduction of red wine and <em>cepas</em> (Spanish porcini), transcends mere novelty. (The combs themselves are recognizable, with spiky crenellations that make one imagine Foghorn Leghorn wildly clutching his scalp.) There are plenty of unintimidating Spanish dishes, too, such as <em>bacalao</em> croquettes (here served with orange-tinged aioli) and <em>pan con tomate</em>. Among a pleasing selection of dishes designated “a la plancha” (a kind of Spanish griddle), the octopus—two baby specimens on a bier of fennel and grapefruit—is a standout. </p><p data-wc="153" word_count="153">Nusser’s commitment to his adoptive cuisine extends to an all-Spanish wine list of some two hundred bottles, including the sonorously named Txomín Etxaniz Txakoli, a light Basque white. Luckily, the servers offer excellent guidance through this unfamiliar territory. Their patience is all the more impressive given that the room is crammed full with elbow-to-elbow seating. (The young, affluent crowd also presses into Casa Mono’s engagingly chaotic offshoot around the corner, Bar Jamón, which shares the wine list.) On a recent evening, when the coat of a departing guest swept a dish of olives from a nearby table, waiters swooped upon the mess with impressive speed. For late diners, there’s a happy consolation for the difficulties of booking; as the place empties and the kitchen staff start to shut down their grills, a pleasant languor prevails—it’s almost Spanish.

There’s latticework detailing, chiffon drapery in shades of pink, and lots of candles, gilt, and mirrors. The room has a pleasant hush, and the servers, who wear orange kurta pajamas, cultivate an exotic languor. </p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The food is drawn from several regions and billed as “authentic home cooking.” And although you are persistently reminded that you can make the dishes at home—the co-executive chef, Suvir Saran, recently published a cookbook—the cuisine is more haute than homey. “Indian food is better when it’s cheap and messy,” one diner complained. Maybe so, but the dishes offered here transcend any preciousness in presentation. The tasting menus—one featuring meat, the other vegetarian—are best for the adventurous (veal-brain and liver bruschettas make an appearance), the very hungry (each course is not as modestly portioned as the large number of them might suggest), and those who can withstand a whirlwind of spices. </p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">Many of the most appealing items on the tasting menu are offered à la carte, like the <em>zimikand ke kofte</em> (soft and sweet yam dumplings in a tomato-onion sauce), or the Manchurian cauliflower, which is marinated in “spicy ketchup” (similar to a sweet-and-sour sauce). <em>Phool makhane kee sabzee</em>, though, is worth forsaking the tasting menu for: a silky curry studded with chewy lotus seeds and cashews, preferably sopped up with naan. If, as can happen, your waiter seems to forget about bringing the check, you might be just as happy to sink back against the cushions and savor the moment.

The latest arrival is Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, newly installed under the trestle of the Riverside Drive Viaduct in a decreasingly forsaken light-industrial flank of Harlem. The original Dinosaur was founded in Syracuse seventeen years ago by three bikers who had spent the previous half-decade hauling an oil-drum smoker to festivals and motorcycle shows. That one is reportedly a raucous place, cluttered with biker things. The Manhattan incarnation, wood-beamed and warehouse-size, seems more studied, as though designed by someone with a barbecue degree: a hand-painted sign over the bar reads “Comfort Station,” and after just a month the men’s-room walls are thick with graffiti, as though the owners had spent an evening marking them up. </p><p data-wc="223" word_count="223">Of course, no one who cares about smoked meat cares about such matters. It helps, when facing hostile barbecue debates, to dine with an expert, especially an expert who denies that he is one. At lunch the other day, a well-travelled finger-licker consented to mumble some criticisms. First, Dinosaur’s Carolina pulled-pork sandwich is really a Memphis pulled-pork sandwich (not enough vinegar). Second, he said, “they don’t respect the pork.” The same could be said for the beef brisket, which was gyro-tough. His theory was that in a quest for authenticity Dinosaur had erred on the side of blandness, skimping on sauces and spices. The others at the table agreed and found the chicken (the dark meat) and the ribs (pork) smokier and more to their liking. One diner observed that the corn bread, with a sugary glaze, tasted a little like Alpha-Bits, and another discovered, heretically, that pretty much every kind of meat at the table could be improved by dipping it in the melted “Cajun garlic butter” (seasoned with “Cajun foreplay”) that came with a side order of salt potatoes. The heretic’s pronouncement on the chili, which tasted great but had the consistency of spaghetti sauce, hinted at a consensus: “There aren’t enough solid things in it.” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for lunch and dinner.

Cucina—the progenitor of Park Slope’s restaurant row—has reopened with a new name and new Manhattan partners (ex-Babbo front-of-the-house types). It might be the twenty-foot-tall curving walls, the canvases brushed with metallic paint, or the eerie absence of kids, but it hardly feels like the Slope.</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">	The food is also new, and it’s not just Italian anymore. Chef and part owner Michael Fiore, a holdover from Cucina, has managed to wind together flavors and styles from all over the Mediterranean without creating a disconnected smorgasbord. The appetizers are full of grace notes: fennel-andpistachio stuffing in the house-made <em>porchetta</em>, toasted almonds in the flaky phyllo duck rolls. The braised-lamb-shank entrée comes with a horseradish <em>gremolata</em>, a nod to Cucina’s famous osso buco, but it also makes use of Tunisian <em>harissa</em> and <em>merguez</em>. Other standouts are the sautéed skate with <em>beurre noisette</em> and raisins, and fresh bucatini coated in a bright pistachio pesto.</p><p data-wc="86" word_count="86">	The disparate ingredients are well matched by an eclectic wine list, and the clean-cut servers, who appear recruited from business school instead of art school, have a thorough knowledge of both. Tempo does have its little pretensions, like serving its wine by the miniature carafe, or <em>quartino</em>, rather than by the glass. Still, it’s a surprise to find that the rates are so reasonable—for the elbow room alone, they probably could have imported Manhattan prices. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner.

At Pure’s bar one recent evening, a man waiting for his date was enticed by a small rock holding down a neighbor’s bill. “Could I get one of those?” he inquired, thinking it was a little snack. Thankfully, nothing on the menu at this upscale vegan eatery faintly resembles a mouthful of pebbles, and the waitstaff, who are attentive, knowledgeable, and glowing, are impossibly pleased to introduce diners to the joys of raw food.</p><p data-wc="186" word_count="186">The kitchen at Pure contains no meat, no dairy, no ovens, and no stoves. Nothing is heated above a hundred and eighteen degrees Fahrenheit—to preserve beneficial enzymes—and food dehydrators and processors are used to produce creative approximations of pasta, beans, and cheese. (Soft corn tortillas are filled with “beans” made from sun-dried tomatoes and sunflower seeds; the “sour cream” topping is a purée of cashews, young coconut meat, and lime juice.) Made with impeccably lush produce, the dishes turned out here are often as vibrant as the vermillion walls. In the Thai lettuce wraps, deep-green leaves are rolled around crisp, tangy cabbage and mango, while cashew “cheese” is enfolded between thin crimson slices of beets to form ravioli. Flavors are also unfailingly bright, with surprising combinations of savory and sweet, like a mushroom-and-asparagus tart with a drizzle of huckleberry sauce. But the textures are sometimes unappealing: the tart crust was dense and tough, while other entrées came out mushy. “It’s like something you’d eat on a camping trip,” one diner said after trying a forkful of the creamy squash pasta. </p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">The best course at Pure is dessert, when the chefs relax the orthodoxy, cheating a bit with honey (not vegan) and maple syrup (not raw). A chocolate terrine has a streak of fudgy dark chocolate and is studded with hazelnuts, and the chocolate ganache has the addictive richness of brownie batter. Then, of course, there are the cocktails: sake whirled together with organic juices and teas, which almost seem healthy. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner.

The greater portion of the <em>kaiseki</em>-style menu is lavish and poetically obfuscating, with a foreword that dedicates the diner’s palate to umami, the fifth taste. Delicately proportioned (and punitively priced) dishes, meant for sharing, are served with ceremonial flair, from the scaly root of wasabi grated on a slab of sharkskin to the Nakagawa River stone, where diners can lightly grill thin, tender, fat-streaked strips of Kobe beef. An enigmatic menu item boasts wild scallops and “mystery twin”—a small bite of turnip hidden among the creamy, sesame-encrusted shellfish. Crisp asparagus spears come in a jacket of spicy rice-cracker batter. </p><p data-wc="201" word_count="201">Megu, the first U.S. outpost of Koji Imai’s Japanese-restaurant empire, has been open since March (a second will open here next fall), and its grand ambitions are apparent. The restaurant’s distinction, according to one server, is its commitment to the smallest details of the supply chain: rice grown to specific conditions in Oregon and fish caught with lines and poles rather than nets, because “fish don’t like to be stressed.” The effect on diners, however, can be less than relaxing: each party’s entrance into the cavernous dining room prompts a conversationshattering cry of “<em>Irashaimase</em>” (“welcome”). The volume is amplified by the number of staff, who wear hand-painted shirts or kimono-style dresses brought from Japan and who swoop down at the slightest sign of need, or as the last morsel of food is lifted from a plate. The centerpiece of the menacingly luxurious room is a replica of the enormous Higashi Honganji <em>bonsho</em> bell, underneath which sits a five-foot-tall ice sculpture of Buddha, lit by a candle placed at his feet. As the dishes come and go in dizzying array, the Buddha drips, until his famous belly has melted away. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $15-$180.)</p>

Baron had been called upon to modernize the menu—“to convey ‘downtown’ creativity to the Upper East Side,” according to a press release—with such <em>cucina creativa</em> contributions as home-cured sardines and stuffed leg of rabbit. The transplant didn’t take. The regulars groused and pined for their red sauce. Neighborhood restaurants have to heed the neighbors, and so a couple of months ago Bottero, a slightly cranky but beloved figure who was born (as her Web site puts it) “in Rome, the capital of Italy,” took over again, retaining a few vestiges of Baron’s brief term: the biscotti, for example, which are made in Brooklyn by his wife, Sigrid Benedetti, another Batalian, with whom Baron now runs Hope &amp; Union, in Williamsburg. </p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">This isn’t to say that Paola’s is too fusty or square, at least compared to some of the other Italian restaurants in the vicinity. You’ll see more fur coats and face-lifts around the corner at Elio’s, and you’re more likely to be flagrantly ignored by the waitstaff down a few blocks at Parma. Still, on less busy nights, the crew at Paola’s can be slack enough to make you wonder what constitutes a punitive but not too hostile tip. Like the clientele, the space—Paola’s third, and biggest, home in its twenty-three-year existence—is understated and neat, with an agreeable insinuation of scruffiness. </p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">At neighborhood restaurants, you find what you like and stick with it. Facing a lifetime of Sunday dinners at Paola’s (“Misty” playing over and over, the arteries hardening, the kids growing hairier and more sullen), a Yorkvillean might find succor in some of the simpler things, such as the springy surface tension of the made-to-order mozzarella (served warm), or the hand-rolled spools of ricotta gnocchi. The mushroom ravioli, the <em>bucatini matriciana</em>, and the braised lamb shank invite many happy returns. If not, there’s always the capacious wine list. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

Now the owners have opened an ambitious Italian spot around the corner. Rough gray brick walls make the small room feel spacious, but it’s not immediately clear what the space is intended for; the chrome beaded curtains, the snaky iron candelabras, and the rubbery feel of the chair cushions suggest some kind of sex club, especially when the Italian pop they play (quietly, luckily) veers toward disco. The food, too, is an adventure that can turn weird on you.</p><p data-wc="172" word_count="172">	There must be something to learn from all the geography on the menu, which makes local stops from Alto Adige to Sardinia. At least it proves that Italy is a big country: a terrific winter soup from Trieste, with cranberry beans, potato, and sauerkraut, seems too Slavic to be on the same menu with pesce crudo, that increasingly inescapable Italian sashimi and ceviche. Some dishes are pleasantly grandiose (bucatini carbonara comes with super-rich poached duck eggs and duck prosciutto), and some come across as needlessly pretentious (monkfish is “dusted” with fennel pollen). So how to penetrate the mysteries of the place? It seems like a start when the waiter opens the menu and says, “Let me tell you what we’re trying to do here.” But instead of offering a lesson on Umbrian heirloom lentils or Sardinian pasta styles, they try to do what every Italian restaurant from the Piazza Navona to Mulberry Street tries to do—sweet-talk you with <em>primi </em>and <em>secondi</em> terminology and con you into ordering too much food. </p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">	Generally, the fare at Abboccato is serious and complicated, but the dishes the kitchen has already perfected suggest great promise, such as veal sweetbreads sautéed with speck, wild mushrooms, and <em>vincotto</em>—an aged-grape-must syrup.

So perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising to find, under the antiquated street lights, L’Impero’s beautiful slate courtyard—this time evoking nineteen-fifties Rome more than Hampton Court—with urns of dignified flowers, tables under canvas umbrellas, and a pastel-colored motorbike, which is most definitely a prop. </p><p data-wc="192" word_count="192">	Inside, the colors are restrained chalk blues and chocolate browns and lacquered whites, and the food likewise has a subdued, expensive, sensitive quality. There are many dishes to recommend, though they change with the seasons: lately, there has been an earthy polenta served with a copper pot of mushroom gravy; a tasty rabbit ravioli; and a yellowtail appetizer with ginger oil and red onions. The yellowtail is superb, and the chef, Scott Conant, must realize its appeal: this fall he opened a restaurant in SoHo devoted to crudo, the Italian version of sushi. But L’Impero is, on the whole, less delicate. One signature entrée is the capretto (baby goat), large shingles of pinkish meat that fall from the bone to make a kind of stew with the potato and artichoke accompaniments. A free-range chicken, roasted with autumnal currants and almonds, is wonderfully comforting. A spicy pinot noir goes well with these heavier dishes, and can also carry you through to the cheese course. Anyone who tries to skip dessert will nevertheless be ambushed with a plate of petits fours, including a dense, mottled “chocolate salami” made from dates and nuts. </p><p data-wc="64" word_count="64">	The one disruption to the mature, unexcitable mood is the weirdly rowdy, blue-lit bar area.

Under the warm, flattering yellow light, opera mavens on their way to Lincoln Center fortify themselves for “La Bohème”; intellectuals who’ve drifted down from Columbia read Foucault, helped along by a glass of wine; and immaculately dressed grandes dames flirt decorously with their young admirers. Most of the patrons seem to be regulars. On a recent evening, the hostess greeted nearly every party that came through the door with a peck on the cheek. “Where have you been?” she asked one elderly gentleman. “On vacation?”</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">The food is Gallic comfort food—rabbit, duck, steak—served in American-sized portions. Suppress the urge for the frogs’ legs, which are breaded, fried, and soggy; better is an arugula salad with a mound of mild goat cheese and slivers of soft, sweet pears. A waitress, pressed for a recommendation, hesitated over scallops and chicken before settling on the seared tuna, which arrived on a nest of black and white noodles with a pool of green-onion purée, all subtle flavor and squishy texture. (One hoped she wasn’t trying to move a slow-selling entrée.) Another runner-up, the hanger steak, was tenderly cooked but overwhelmed by gravy, and accompanied by a smooth puddle of buttery mashed potatoes.

It might not be the place to see and be seen that it once was, but its numerous mirrors still enable a kind of theatre. Early on, the cast is decidedly silver-haired. As the evening progresses, a younger crowd takes over, though the fashions—sweater sets, blazers, and button-downs—remain the same. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $19-$29.)</p>

You do the shot, then place the lime on your tongue, coffee side down. The combination may sound silly, but it works wonders: it tastes great, rearranges your mood, and conveys in an instant that this modest place has big intentions. The name of the place (and the drink) derives from an Oklahoma pump manufacturer, but the owners, an enthusiastic pair of young women named Julie Taras and Tasha Garcia, are really referring to their underdog status: they have a tiny budget in a tough restaurant town. </p><p data-wc="251" word_count="251">	The space is airy and simple, with a vaulted ceiling of old brick, and blond plywood shelves, tables, and chairs that were designed and built—without nails—by Taras’s brother Jeffrey, an architecture student at Columbia. The do-it-yourself approach extends to the food; Taras and Garcia make their own sausages and corn their own beef. They have also devised unorthodox names for their concoctions; like the tequila, they seem goofy until you try them. Among the starters, on a recent evening, there was a “box of rocks” (a tin bucket of steamed cockles, accompanied by baby greens and a bowl of broth) and a “tenement soup” (a chunky pork-broth stew of ham, beans, and cabbage). One of the prize entrées—the unfortunately named “baby’s got bass”—consisted of a hunk of striped bass braised in duck fat and served in a casserole dish with smoked bacon, braised fennel, baby clams, and a peppery lentil ragout. The “swine of the week” was braised pork shoulder laid ropily over an Asian-pear-and-cabbage slaw: small portion, gigantic flavor. The root-vegetable-you’ve-never-had of the week was a side dish of crosnes. Also called Chinese artichokes or chorogis, crosnes look like beetle larvae and taste like water chestnuts, but, in fact, they are tubers, in the mint family. Taras had discovered some at the greenmarket and pan-roasted them in butter, onions, and herbs. They were perhaps the littlest giants of all.

There are big squall-proof white vinyl booths and smaller ones made of a blue Teflon-treated material. The best touch is the ceiling, which has a wood-and-plaster vault that exactly replicates the look of a massive Fiberglas yacht cabin, with teak beams and skylights, making the place seem simultaneously more intimate and more luxurious. </p><p data-wc="80" word_count="80">The food mainly lives up to the high expectations set by this kind of décor. Josh Capon, the chef from Canteen, stayed on and has created a magnificent raw bar. Japanese red snapper comes with a little square of crisp skin, adding just enough texture to hold up in the foaming <em>yuzu</em>-olive-oil dipping sauce. Slices of immaculate arctic char are topped with orange caviar and horseradish; the wild coho salmon, which is cubed, is covered with a basil-soy tea. </p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">Some items, it must be said, are innovative to the point of being unappetizing—the <em>hamachi</em> and foie gras on a stick brings to mind a kind of strange surf-and-turf Fudgsicle. Others lack seaworthiness: the crab cakes could have been bought in bulk from Costco. While there are entrées—a Mediterranean-style red snapper served with lemon oil and sea salt, a two-pound lobster artfully eviscerated—many diners opt for the various small plates on the menu. These spare offerings are probably most conducive to big tables where no one is really sure who’s paying. But, then again, in surroundings where largesse and ease seem so attainable, who could worry about the price of four such fantastic nibbles of fluke?

Mothers leave their empty strollers outside and dash in to get hot chocolate for their toddlers (“Not too hot!”) and latte for themselves. For lingerers, a bench with school-desk-size tables runs along one wall; customers face the bar like students awaiting a lesson. </p><p data-wc="179" word_count="179">The coffee is La Colombe—“from Philadelphia, by way of Seattle, by way of France,” to be precise—and expertly turned out on a La Spaziale espresso machine. Josh George, the barista, inscribes a dainty fern pattern in the froth of every cappuccino. “It’s all in the wrist action,” he says. The espresso itself is a rich mahogany brown, slightly sweet and smooth. No sugar needed. The menu, lettered onto a mirror hanging behind the bar, promises eggs for fifty cents; one recent morning, the hard-boiled-egg rack, a stainless-steel pyramid topped by a salt shaker, stood empty on the counter. “No eggs today?” a young girl complained, apparently ready to give up the very notion of breakfast, until she was appeased by the offer of a chocolate-chip muffin. The croissants, from Marquet Pâtisserie, are golden and buttery; and the danishes are especially good—one has a chewy layer of coconut amid the flaky swirls, another is studded with raisins. The orange juice is freshly squeezed each day. To prove it, wire baskets full of oranges hang overhead. </p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">Café Regular’s European vibe—it has pressed-tin walls and an elegantly curved wooden bar complete with two (unused) metal ashtrays protruding from its side—is sophisticated and relaxed, and maybe a little bohemian: look for a posted copy of the lyrics to Bob Dylan’s “One More Cup of Coffee.” If you do take yours to go, you might be treated to a moment of conscientious improvisation; to forestall the prospect of a soggy bag, George has been known to lay a square of waxed paper over the mouth of an espresso drink before popping on a domed lid.

(His friends Mikhail Baryshnikov and the late Joseph Brodsky both invested at some point.) Kaplan is one of those genial spirits who seem to know—or want to get to know—everyone. On a recent night, he paused at a table for a quick hello, then excused himself: he had to attend to the pair of Russian aristocrats sitting in the corner booth. When he returned, it was with a Martini, and there were introductions all around. After meeting one young lady at the table, he said, musingly, “Ah, Emily!” and seemed about to recite some verse, vast tracts of which he has reportedly memorized. Instead, he gave a little lesson on the samovar, the tea urn that was the centerpiece of every Russian table. He collects them, in brass and silver, and displays them around the place. </p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">	There is a murky glamour to the Samovar. Tasselled lampshades, absinthe green and cherry red, cast an intimate glow over every table and booth. This light is kind to the food, which is a little strange—which is to say, authentic. A violentmagenta cabbage-and-beet slaw accompanies Georgian lamb chops, and the plate of homemade pickles includes a grayish heirloom tomato, steeped in pungent, spicy brine. The fresh blini are heaven (even if the salmon is too dense and pink) and come with a gravy boat of sour cream. The pastry—in the vol-au-vent, the <em>pirozhok</em>, and the salmon <em>coulibiac</em>—is buttery and crisp, a perfect vehicle for the rich fillings. One of the most modest items, and one of the best, is the wild-mushroom soup. It is thick with porcini mushrooms and barley and served piping hot. </p><p data-wc="68" word_count="68">	Among the celebrating Russians, clinking shot glasses and laughing darkly, there are always a few artists and writers. Some nights, there are poetry readings on the second floor.

The offerings are ever-changing, according to what appears at the market; recently there were crostini with a smear of garlicky chicken liver or piles of roasted cherry tomatoes, and pumpkin fritters, lightly battered and supremely fresh. The eggplant salad with ricotta achieved a melting creaminess, and wood-roasted octopus curled out of a heap of piquant olive-and-pistachio salsa. </p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">“I’m just here for you, so take your time,” a waitress assured a diner lingering over the menu one early-autumn night. Later, she brought out a sparkling red wine for an undecided guest to taste, saying, “If you don’t like it, I won’t be offended.” The individually sized pizzas are cooked in a brick oven, hand-built by Gennaro Iadicicco, a third-generation oven artisan. When they arrived, flopping over the edges of the plates, the crust was thin and toothsome—as crisp as a cracker on the cheeseless clam-and-chili pizza, soft but still firm under the influence of the <em>quattro formaggi</em>. The chef has improved upon the traditional toppings, offering house-cured meats instead: <em>guanciale</em>, or pork cheek, is a thicker, richer cut of bacon, while pepperoni is easily trumped by the tender bite of fennel salami. </p><p data-wc="120" word_count="120">Franny’s, which opened in April, has quickly become a neighborhood favorite. On weekday nights, its closely spaced tables fill with professional couples carrying briefcases and gym bags and Park Slope families training the palates of their young. On the weekend, waiting parties take cocktails to the back garden. Despite the easygoing atmosphere, there’s no escaping the restaurant’s principles (it sells sweatshop-free, eco-friendly T-shirts, and its takeout pizza boxes are made from recycled fibres). And then there’s the aversion to waste. If you leave even a slender wedge of your salami pie, expect a waitress to ask, “You’re sure you don’t want to take that home?” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner. Entrées $9-$15.)</p>

The café is on the ground floor of the Neue Galerie, the three-year-old museum of early-twentieth-century German and Austrian art that occupies a grand Beaux-Arts mansion at Eighty-sixth Street’s swanky Fifth Avenue end. The space, modelled on a fin-de-siècle Viennese <em>Kaffeehaus</em>, is stately and period-perfect, with wood-panelled walls, Josef Hoffman fixtures, Adolf Loos chairs, and a selection of Austrian newspapers. Sometimes, in the evenings, a pianist plays Strauss. Children are barred from the museum but permitted in the restaurant, where something in the air—a vestigial memory of Captain Von Trapp’s whistle, perhaps, or the promise of schlag—compels them to behave, in a seen-and-not-heard kind of way. </p><p data-wc="189" word_count="189">Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef and owner of Wallsé, a Viennese restaurant downtown, runs the kitchen, which turns out slim, delicate renditions of traditional Austrian cuisine. Breakfast is exquisite and sparsely attended; the bacon and scrambled eggs that accompany the<em> Gröstl</em> (a potato-onion hash) are a rebuke to the Greek coffee shops down the street. Around lunchtime, a line forms in the museum’s lobby, yet lingerers get no dirty looks—from the servers, at least. (This may be the place’s most inauthentic touch.) And there is much to linger over, as the day wears on: liverwurst-and-onion confit spread on squares of rough wheat bread; a chestnut soup with a cap of foam and a prune soaked in Armagnac; a glass of <em>Holundersaft</em>—elder-flower syrup in sparkling water, with a single elder-flower leaf. Some things on the menu, such as the salads and the spätzle, are little more than adequate stopovers on the way to the sweets. The tortes and strudels, arrayed on a marble shelf, rival the Klimts and Schieles in the galleries upstairs. (Open daily, except Tuesdays, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $10-$23.)</p>

One young lady, wearing plaid suspenders over a bustier and sitting on a stoop, shouted at a bunch of Japanese kids waiting in front of Kenka: “Don’t eat sushi! Fish have to die to make sushi!” But she needn’t have worried. Kenka is the kind of snack shop and tavern known as an <em>izakaya</em> in Japan. It serves more than a hundred dishes, but no sushi.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">	The crowd in the low-ceilinged room is boisterous, partly because of the drinks (dollar-fifty draft beers and a wide selection of vodkalike cocktails made from distilled rice) and partly because of the music (singsong fifties and sixties Japanese pop blaring from gray loudspeakers). The Japanese menu is written on slips of paper and tacked to the walls; the English translations, though, are almost as baffling. “Nostalgic Japanese ham cutlet” is a popular dish, frequently sold out. “Grilled eel inside cooked egg” may sound like a magic trick, but there’s no shell involved. On the other hand, nothing could be simpler than grilled corn on the cob drenched with a sweet, syrupy sauce. </p><p data-wc="150" word_count="150">	The Japanese staff gamely tries to explain things—the whole fried frog, the rabbit miso soup—but with so many dishes costing only two or three dollars you might as well just keep ordering. Be careful, though, not to lose track of what is what. On a recent late night, a table that had consumed a few cheap beers forgot it had ordered bull penis. When the dish arrived and the diners looked puzzled, the waitress blushed, said “Cow . . .,” pointed demurely downward, and then retreated to the kitchen with a giggle. The brave fellow who sampled the dish reported it to be very tender and fatty. It’s easy to spot the other tables—Japanese and not—who have taken the same risk.

When it arrived, in a gnome’s cap of terra-cotta, the lid was removed, and a lemony fog drifted over the table. The mildness of the meat was complicated by the sharp, salty taste of green olives. But first came an appetizer of four tightly wrapped triangles of pastry filled with a chicken-and-almond mixture and fairy-dusted with confectioner’s sugar and cinnamon; tangy, well-seasoned lamb shish kabob; and a plate of <em>zaâlouk</em>—a smoked-eggplant mash, similar to ratatouille—and light, whipped hummus. Disappointingly, there was nothing Moroccan offered for dessert; what they had was crème brûlée, apple pie, and sorbet. <em>Pistilla,</em> a typical dessert, was “too much trouble,” one waiter said, although a chicken <em>pistilla</em> can be had as a main course.</p><p data-wc="71" word_count="71">Hours passed.

It sits at the end of a blind alley off Rivington Street, behind a subdued robin’s-egg-blue door with a weathered knob. Inside, there is a taxidermy shop’s worth of heads. Over a fireplace, a big white goose is frozen mid-flap; a small boar snarls on the wall; there is even a model of a human skull above the curved zinc bar. </p><p data-wc="149" word_count="149">The food is—in the words of a sweet waitress, who casts her eyes toward her employer, Will Tigertt, for confirmation—“early American Midwestern.” Tigertt, who co-owns the restaurant with Taavo Somer, admits he’s from Detroit but says, “It’s a long story,” dashing any hopes of hearing about ancestors and frontiers. In any case, the menu seems more nineteen-fifties country club or present-day gastropub than pioneer: avocado vinaigrette (half an avocado brimming with dressing); spinach salad, with bacon and pine nuts; a dreamy, thick artichoke dip, served with toast. (The breads are grainy and fresh, from a bakery in Long Island City.) For those really trying to gain weight, or to neutralize a bitter Negroni whisked together by the bartender, there are Devils on Horseback: rich nuggets of Stilton-stuffed prunes, wrapped in bacon and served burning hot. More subtle is the trout, delicately flavored with fresh thyme. </p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">The brunch hour is peaceful at Freeman’s. Light pours through a many-paned picture window, and the puddles in the alley gleam. This is the best time to appreciate the restaurant’s innocence: the poached eggs nestled like throw pillows on a bed of watercress; the ungainly little blobs of lamb sausage; the pinecones strewn about for decoration; the juice glasses, placed on every table, that contain a child’s arrangement of a daisy, a purple aster, and a stem of Queen Anne’s lace. All of this goes a long way toward explaining how such a highly stylized place—crowded, despite its brand-newness and deliberate obscurity, with sophisticates—feels so improbably genuine.

Earlier this year, he left with some of his mates and set up a rival post in the middle of Manhattan, on the ground floor of the old Vanderbilt Hotel. You’d think that the last thing this or any city needs is another steak house: how many bachelor parties, closing dinners, and Republican Conventions can there be? Need doesn’t apply, though, when the newcomer is so carefully modelled on a place like Luger’s, where the indulgences are idiosyncratic and state of the art. Zwiener chose not to import the old layout—at Wolfgang’s, an original Guastavino vaulted ceiling adds class and a few dozen decibels—but the experience is more or less the same, from the service (blunt) to the sauce (sweet).</p><p data-wc="290" word_count="290">The mark of a proper steak house is the uninhibited presentation of animal fat, in its many magnificent guises. At Wolfgang’s, as at Luger’s, the signature vehicle is the porterhouse; a waiter pronounced it “the best,” in a scolding tone that might have suggested to a cynical diner that the porterhouse is also Wolfgang’s money-maker. It is cut in thick slices from a T-bone and served on a scuffed old platter, from which the waiter eagerly spoons out a broth of butter and blood, as though it were holy water. Among the other beef entrées, the rib eye, a crude but no less gorgeous hunk of meat, charred on the outside and marbled, if not riddled, with fat inside, may be the most flavorful of the lot. In the company of such cuts, the filet mignon seems almost lean, except that it’s the size of a cantaloupe. There are lumpy, glistening lamb chops, too, and apparently some fish dishes, though just think of all that mercury. The appetizer of sizzling Canadian bacon ought to be rated XXX. The creamed spinach is buttery without being excessively creamy. As for the German potatoes, pan-roasted with onions and a variety of lipids, well, the waiter is correct when he says, with something approaching hostility, “The potatoes are good.” Arnie, the maître d’, is more solicitous: after the cheesecake course, he might stop by to show off a picture of Rudy Giuliani at the restaurant or to tell a joke, in his Bogart voice, involving bull’s balls and men from many nations. One supposes that someday there will be an Arnie’s Steakhouse, too. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $29.95-$75.90.)</p>

The tastes at a Beppe dinner on a summer evening are those of an imaginary Tuscan hillside farm, with high rank given to low starches: his farrotto is different every night, and his Tuscan fries, with fried fresh herbs laid over the quick-sautéed potatoes, should be forced at gunpoint into every McDonald’s in America.

Large copper pots hang from a blasted-brick wall, and in the bathroom worn editions of M. F. K. Fisher’s “How to Cook a Wolf” and “Larousse Gastronomique” have been thoughtfully supplied. But the best education at this spectacular restaurant can be had simply by taking a seat at the narrow counter that borders the kitchen and asking the chef and co-owner, Marco Canora (formerly of Craft), about everything that he turns out. It feels very personal when he offers a hot shot glass of yellow-pepper purée—a pleasantly uncomplicated way to start a meal—and recommends an entrée: Alaskan king salmon, poached at 110 degrees “so it doesn’t lose its fat” and served at room temperature with a lively salad of green beans and jewel-like cherry tomatoes in a light and peppery vinaigrette. Canora has a habit of presenting several preparations of the same ingredient: the lamb comes with a lamb sausage in a zucchini canoe; the monkfish has a roasted eggplant with crispy fried capers and a seaweedy heap of julienned eggplant on the side; the <em>crudo</em> appetizer consists of little piles of minced raw red snapper topped by a slab of raw red snapper, rosemary, and a fleck of red pepper.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">	This restaurant is a hopeful place.

(She suggested a rosé, which was perfect.) Watching the line cooks hustle and sweat and Canora complete every plate with a flourish of fresh herbs and seasoning does nothing to debunk the mystery—not even when you catch him, out of the corner of your eye, popping a lettuce leaf from a waiting green salad into his mouth.

The interior is mid-nineteenth-century minimalist cool—stripped to the original bricks and beams but with floating concrete staircases. </p><p data-wc="213" word_count="213">Though Pelaccio is a big greenmarket shopper and scours the outer boroughs for his ingredients, mainly he’s a fiend for pig. He serves a memorable appetizer of braised pork belly with a rhubarb glaze, tosses pork belly on top of a clay pot of frog’s legs, and even mixes it into a jellyfish salad. He takes huge slabs of bacon and stacks them with yellow and red beets, and adds prosciutto to monkfish. There’s even something suggestive of the bacon pan about the way he presents his wonderful chocolate ganache with sour cherries in a miniature cast-iron skillet. He calls his cooking New York Modern. The noodle dishes announce their origins (the garganelli with baby lamb hearts is Italian; the coconut broth with lobster and mysteriously medicinal galangal flowers is Malay), but most of his concoctions, however fearless, feel so natural that there’s no pressure to puzzle out what they mean. The low-key sign out front (there’s just a simple brass “5” above the door knocker) hasn’t kept the place from being overrun. At the parlor-floor bar on any given weeknight you can overhear someone in Wall Street attire saying things like “You’re sure this is your most expensive Cognac?”(Open daily for dinner.

It may seem unsporting to invoke the ghost of an old tenant, since most restaurants in New York were other restaurants in a previous life, but the memory of Isla (mint-clogged mojitos, mambo, and guys in guayaberas) hangs reproachfully over the pretenses of its replacement. <em>Mas</em> means farmhouse, in the argot of Provence—“Mas (farmhouse)” is printed on the menu—and so the owners, Hugh Crickmore, the former sommelier at Marseille, and Galen Zamarra, the former chef de cuisine at Bouley Bakery, have altered the space a bit to summon Verdon instead of Varadero. The bar and a few pillars are made of stacked fieldstones, the walls are planked with reclaimed barn wood, and the central table—the farm table, they call it—is often given over to communal dining. Although the acoustics evoke a jailhouse and the waitstaff calls the bar “the lounge,” in most respects Mas seems as snug and tidy as you’d expect a <em>mas</em> to be. </p><p data-wc="213" word_count="213">Still, let’s not kid ourselves: Mas is a place to indulge urbane, expensive tastes, and Zamarra’s cuisine, which, broadly, is seasonal French-American, is scrupulous and clever in a most cosmopolitan way. A greenmarket aficionado can hold up a fiddlehead and say, “This is a fiddlehead.” Some people consider it a point of honor to order certain fishy fishes, to demonstrate worldliness and pluck, but Zamarra’s grilled sardines—tender and mild and served on a crumbly Parmesan cracker with caramelized onions and pine nuts—require none. A spring terrine of baby spinach, asparagus, and an assortment of other organic vegetables may look a little like the caked grass clippings that collect under a lawnmower, but it is in fact delightful. To truly taste the earth, one must try the “clay pigeon”—squab baked in a clay shell. The squab itself is rich and delicious, but the shards of clay, which arrive piled on the plate, next to the cuts of squab, taste like dirt. You are not supposed to eat them, of course. They are there for decoration. But in the heat of the moment, amid such wonderful concoctions, a diner can make mistakes.

(914-366-9600)—The news, this spring, of the opening of Daniel and David Barber’s co-venture with David Rockefeller in organic farming and dining was of sufficient promise to send normally immobile New Yorkers hitching rides to the ominously quiet and leafy wilderness of Westchester. The project, eight years in the making, involved reclaiming the mossy Stone Barns on the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills (where an earlier generation of Rockefellers grew up, drinking milk from their own dairy) as an organic husbandry center, complete with a restaurant and one of the largest in-ground, organic-soil greenhouses on the East Coast, creating a single, mostly self-sustaining farming and dining experience—a realization of the new American cook’s dream of a purely seasonal and truly local cooking, equal parts Petit Trianon and Chez Panisse. </p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">	The food is a delicious and unpretentious mix of French and American so, well, organically combined that it seems less like fusion than fission cooking—an explosive and happily outward style, without any fussy brooding on bilingual equations or crossovers. (And—very unFrenchly—unpolluted by cream or butter.) Dan Barber and Michael Anthony, the executive chef, are unafraid to repeat a single ingredient: in asparagus season they might offer asparagus wrapped in pancetta, frothy asparagus soup, and local veal with more asparagus and finish with a rhubarb compote with its own mint ice cream. (Showier cooks would have put asparagus in the ice cream, too.)</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">	Though this is as good as the new American restaurant cooking gets, the beautiful rusticity of the project and the environment is not yet decisively represented on the plate. Hardened New Yorkers dream of whole roasted pigs and shared soups, of udder-fresh cheeses and bowls of fruit—of a cooking that will not merely be farm based but will express the idea of the farm. This is, of course, a dream that is not easy to square with the necessities of an expensive restaurant in a rich and sophisticated New York suburb. But a contented diner, backstroking his way home down the Hudson, can be forgiven for thinking that Barber and Anthony could plant themselves still deeper in the soil to see what they might yet harvest. (Open Wednesdays through Saturdays for dinner and Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $46-$66.)</p>

In the entrance, backlit closeups of bamboo, lotus flowers, and pussy willows spoof the unappetizing overhead photos of dishes in cheaper Chinese spots. An open kitchen promises drama—flames do shoot up from the main wok now and then—but the conspicuously un-Chinese crew already seems to be just passing time.</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">	The listings in the red-and-gold menu are so minimalist (#501 Pork with Cashews, #502 Spicy Pork with Bok Choy, #506 Pork with Scallions) that it’s hard to fight a creeping feeling of pointlessness. The barbecued spareribs vary from bland to impossibly chewy, like a doggie toy, and the tangerine beef is so strange that it’s scary to think what happened to it. The sauceless cold noodles come with bok choy and peas, both steamed nearly gray. Only the white rice seems to have been competently prepared. </p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">	The main dining rooms downstairs are trying for a rehabilitated-opium-den look (lots of pillows, carved screens, pinups in the bathrooms), but they can’t quite rise above the dank basement feeling (exposed brick, visible plumbing, and a sense of being too far from a safe exit). The large gold fans, cheap decorative découpage plates, and futon-shop lanterns look like they were chosen for ease of striking, whenever No. 1 Chinese goes under. There are paper placemats, printed with the Chinese zodiac, and fortune cookies stuffed with jokes written by the restaurant’s staff. Too bad the waiters often can’t be bothered to serve them.

The new Mexican place has a tall potted palm outside, where ladies in orange plastic chairs drink margaritas; at sundown, even the gritty sidewalk glows. The atmosphere inside is a bit more self-conscious, with two panels of the wall given over to installations of votive candles and bouquets of gerbera daisies and a motif of dizzying circular drawings. (Not Mayan, if anyone was wondering—just overdesigned.) </p><p data-wc="169" word_count="169">	A Mexican dinner pretty much has to start with a bowl of guacamole. At Ixta, the stuff is chunky and fresh, or “hand hacked,” as the menu puts it. There are chips, of course, but the waiters also goodnaturedly accommodate requests for crudités; the mild guacamole gets livelier when shovelled up with poblano-pepper spears. The presentation of the dishes is notably uniform—everything seems to be served in a precarious but admirable heap. Shaved-zucchini fritters sit like tumbleweed on the roasted bass, there’s a snarl of vegetables on the pumpkin-seed-encrusted salmon, and the soft-shell crab wears something that looks as if it were inspired by Isabella Blow. A profusion of salsas, relishes, glazes, and emulsions—the culinary shorthand for this kind of up-to-date nouvelle—can make the underlying meat seem secondary. Any salty pan-fried fish will do. But the wonderful flavor of the baby lamb chops is heightened by a sauce of pale-green jalapeño crème fraîche and a mash of avocados on the side. </p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">	Ixta bills itself as a “cocina Mexicana and tequila bar,” and there are twenty-six kinds of tequila and five mescals to choose from. But the most appealing nod to the boozy theme may be the margarita meringue pie, a heap of egg-white fluff served with a scoop of lime sorbet and a Martini-glass-shaped cookie with sugar on the rim. (Open weekdays for lunch and daily for dinner. Entrées $17-24.)</p>

Pity the blind dates, of which there are many. But don’t pity them too much, because the food here is probably more absorbing than anything they might find to talk about. </p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">	First-timers are encouraged to order the grilled short ribs, which are succulent and thick and cling to their lemongrass skewers. A lobster salad, piquant from lots of rice-wine vinegar and lime and seasoned with chile peppers, comes with licoricey pickled lotus stems. Tuna spring rolls are dribbled with truffle oil and served with a “pineapple-soy dipping sauce.” They’re a far cry from the simple, leaf-wrapped, mint-and-basil-stuffed rolls traditional in Vietnam—though those are on the menu, too. The recipes, according to Michael Huynh, the chef and part-owner, are “half what I learned from my mom, half New York style.” Huynh, who is thirty-nine, began cooking in his mother’s restaurant, in Saigon, when he was eleven. He came to America four years later as a boat person and was adopted by an Italian family with a restaurant in upstate New York. </p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">	Desserts provide all kinds of weirdness: a lime custard that is as spicy as anything on the dinner menu (thanks to a habañero marmalade); a deep-fried banana spring roll with chunky peanut-butter dressing; and, the other night, a whitechocolate mousse made with the extract of a Southeast Asian herb called <em>pandan.</em> The <em>pandan</em> turned the mousse pistachio green, which made for an odd contrast with the sour maroon pomegranate sauce that had been crisscrossed over it. A sip of expansive pineapple-and-papaya-flavored green tea was necessary to restore equilibrium. </p><p data-wc="65" word_count="65">	Huynh is trained as an architect (he designed the space), and still practices “in the morning.” Six months ago, he opened a sister restaurant, Bao Noodles, in Gramercy Park, downstairs from the apartment where he has lived for fourteen years. The food is slightly less adventuresome than that at Bao 111. “I wanted someplace to eat lunch,” he said. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $11-$24.) </p>

Riera and the owner, Arnaud Erhart, both burly and bearded, run the floor with intimidation tactics that seem borrowed from the auto mechanics on “Monster Garage.” There is no room for negotiation. </p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">Erhart is also an aggressive morning marketer, and brings in a fresh haul every day for his chef, Pascal LeSeac’h. The menu changes nightly, but the price is always twenty-five dollars for an appetizer, entrée, and dessert, and there are always three choices of each. LeSeac’h has a nice touch at the stove: a recent roast-pork entrée came with a thick layer of caramelized onions; balsamic vinegar infused every bite. A lamb chop, ordered rare, was seared perfectly. You can also order à la carte or pick from a list of Les Petites Faims: oysters, steak tartare, a charcuterie plate. The codfish brandade—fish mashed with garlic and cream—was passed around the table and swiftly disappeared. For dessert, there are simple tarts and <em>financiers</em>. </p><p data-wc="122" word_count="122">The restaurant occupies a well-designed storefront on a ramshackle block, and lazy sunset basketball games on a court across the street provide background noise. There are “No Ikea” stickers in the window—it’s clear which side Erhart comes down on in the debate over Red Hook’s future. Unapologetically unappetizing anti-Bush linocuts by a genuine waterfront artist hang inside. The list of mostly organic wines is esoteric and hard to read (the type looks as if it was bashed out on an Underwood), and it leaves even experienced drinkers entirely at the mercy of the owner’s terse suggestions. But the suggestions are worth taking. Erhart, who was trained as a sommelier, finds thirty-some-odd-dollar bargains and decants them into lab beakers.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">	A loyal cult following of crisply dressed food fans—they look to be from brownstone Brooklyn—seems to enjoy the cocky disdain here. When, one night recently, a diner broke his water glass, Riera at first denied him a replacement, and seemed serious when he said, “I don’t know about you . . . ” Then he turned to do battle with a young woman who was eager for a table and growing impatient with the wait.

We don’t have to go to Sicily to buy wine!”—the relative lack of local production in the United States is refreshing. In the markets of Manhattan and Brooklyn, he can find anything, in any season: razor clams, calamari, arugula, pomegranates, peas. The menu of this young restaurant, of which he is the executive chef and co-owner (with Antonio Bellomo, a Sicilian), nonetheless maintains a Mediterranean cast. A summer soup (<em>pappa al pomodoro,</em> made with tomatoes, bread, olive oil, and basil) is served at room temperature, with a paper bag full of bread for mopping. It is a child’s no-spaghetti, all-sauce fantasy. <em>Inzimino,</em> a rich stew of spinach, chickpeas, and calamari, is found everywhere from Greece to coastal Spain; Nuti’s version is prepared with Nero d’Avola, a full-bodied Sicilian wine. And meatballs made from ground chicken and Parmesan are irresistibly light—Nuti picked up the recipe at Cibreo, in Florence, where he used to work. </p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">	Thursdays through Saturdays, the place is a zoo, and the antic maître d’ can leave you to languish at the polished concrete bar, but one mellow Sunday night there were only a few diners. (Lou Reed was one of them.) It was possible to be soothed by the subtle décor—the crinkly white rice-paper ceiling, the long birch branches sweeping the walls. A large party in the corner, backs to Houston Street, sampled their way through the desserts, many of which were formed in the same round mold. The standout, a “Sicilian chili dark chocolate budino,” came with a story from Nuti. “Antonio told me about how the Spaniards invaded Mexico in the fifteen-hundreds and brought back mole,” he said. “Palermo is the only place in Italy where you can find this—chili-powder-and-cocoa truffles—and I thought, we can do a little twist here.” The pudding is aggressively chocolaty, more cake than mousse, and spicy enough that you might find yourself reaching for the bread.

It is on the top floor of American Girl Place, the new emporium devoted to the sale and care of American Girl dolls (there is a doll hospital and a doll hair salon). One is expected to bring a doll to lunch—the dolls get booster seats and teacups—but little girls who don’t yet own one can choose from an array of loaners. An example of this rare species, a nine-year-old Dubliner who was in town recently for a few days of shopping, showed up the other day for the 11 <span class="smallcaps">a.m.</span> seating and borrowed Samantha, a doll who, according to her bio, “is a bright compassionate girl living with her wealthy grandmother in 1904.” The Irish Girl was shown to a table in the center of the room. She ordered pink lemonade, then recognized a friend at a nearby table. “I know loads of people in New York,” she said, as she got up to say hello.</p><p data-wc="190" word_count="190">	The American Girl brand, born to the Pleasant Company, belongs to Mattel now, and it is clear that market research has been conducted to identify cuisine that offends as few kiddie palates as possible. For an amuse-bouche the table gets cinnamon rolls redolent of airport layovers. The first course is a vast platter of carrot and celery sticks, fresh fruit, cubes of American cheese, mini-quiches, and pretzel bread sticks. The second course consists of various whine-proof standbys, such as mini-cheeseburgers with curly fries, chicken tenders with macaroni and cheese, and tic-tac-toe pizza—a square grid with sliced peppers for “X”s and disks of pepperoni for “O”s. What dishes there are to please picky chaperones—poached salmon over a salad niçoise, say—are so wan that one envies the kids their mac and cheese. The Irish Girl pronounced the burgers “good,” the curly fries “cool,” and the chocolate mousse “delicious.” As for the chicken tenders, she declared, “I’ve had better.” Samantha had nothing to add. After a time, the Irish Girl said, “I so wanna get a doll.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Prix fixe $18-$23.)</p>

The doll-house scale of this restaurant requires a profusion of “excuse me”s, many of them delivered gently by a busboy in a starchy cruise-ship coat carrying trays of “deconstructed” oysters Rockefeller and Mississippi paddlefish roe. In a spotless exposed kitchen on the second floor—it’s no bigger than one you’d find in a studio apartment, and inches from the upstairs dining room—Allison Vines-Rushing and Slade Rushing, the newlywed chefs, must be particularly diplomatic. “We trade off cooking and cleaning,” Vines-Rushing, who is from Louisiana, said. She was sautéing spinach in a pan. “It’s only fair.” The tact achieves consummation in Denis Le Denn, the maître d’ and captain, who runs the downstairs dining room. Tall and broad and formerly of Alain Ducasse, he is “one of the great peacock maître d’s,” according to the owner, Jack Lamb. (Lamb said he was anxious about asking Le Denn to work for him: “He’s so grand—and he’s so big!”) </p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">	The layout doesn’t constrain patrons from getting boisterous, particularly when they follow Le Denn’s recommendation of an apéritif of pink champagne. Every meal starts off with a scallop shell’s worth of pecans, burnt and sugary, with an afterbite of cayenne. Oysters—Hama Hama, Gold Creek, Salutation Cove—wink from a bed of ice on the bar, near a fish tank shaped like a Victorian bell jar. Someone always orders the New Orleans barbecued lobster, which is tender and buttery and served with a nip of thyme and a garlic clove, and then has to fend off poachers. The ceremoniously assembled three-tiered fruits de mer, for a hundred dollars, is easier to share: sweet Taylor Bay scallops, shrimp, caviar, lobster salad, oysters, and clams. The mignonette, relentlessly tart and full of minced onions, goes with almost all of it. </p><p data-wc="88" word_count="88">	For dessert, Lamb serves only baba au rhum but insists on calling it bananas Foster. (There are no bananas.) Le Denn has a heavy pouring hand, and the baba acts like a sponge on the rum. By the end of the night, cheeks are florid—the restaurant, with red banquettes and red checkered walls, is an altogether rosy place—voices loud, largesse abounding. The folks outside waiting for a table literally have their noses pressed up to the glass. (Open for dinner Monday through Saturday. Entrées $24-$36.)</p>

There are three food options on the chalkboard and one drink—a thirty-two-ounce plastic container of sweetened cardamom iced tea. The sandwiches—pulled pork and beef brisket—are well spiced but require a troublesome amount of assembly. (The meat and the bun come wrapped separately.) The thing to get is the “bowl o’ red,” a paper cup full of real Texas-style chili. Tender chunks of beef swim in a brick-red sauce made from whole-pod ancho, chipotle, and New Mexican Hatch chiles. The chili is served hot—the side of shredded cheddar cheese melts on contact—and is just spicy enough to make your eyes water a bit. A tortilla comes on the side. The tea, which has a big sprig of fresh mint in it, goes great with the chili, though it’s a challenge to balance while you’re trying to wipe up the last slick of grease with the tortilla. </p><p data-wc="88" word_count="88">	The square starts to get busy with a lunch crowd around 11:30 <span class="smallcaps">a.m.</span>, when the construction workers break. Most of them bring their own food, and you can spot a few killing off their hour with cigars or Budweiser tall boys in brown bags. The U.P.S. guys eat closer to two, and like to shoot baskets with their trash. In between there’s a lot of hurried munching—people eating while they’re still walking, while they’re on the phone, while they work from briefcases. </p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">	Lang has carts on Wall Street and on Sixth Avenue at 50th Street, and plans to open six more in the next month or so.

Is fondue back? Did it ever go away? And what does fondue mean? </p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">Alyssa Cho, the owner, is no purist; she comes from the “fondue is fun” school, and hopes that through cheese her patrons will find love, or maybe someone to go home with. Though it is true that—besides dessert—Cho serves nothing but cheese fondues, one of them (and there are only three) is made from smoked gouda, which isn’t fun at all. She forgoes the traditional cast-iron-and-Sterno fondue-pot setup in favor of little bowls and candles; the portions are small and the forks are short, an accident of design that makes it difficult, in large groups, for a guy at the gouda end of the table to get his fill of the Grana-Padano-and-Gruyère. As for drink, Cho recommended saketinis made with sake and Soju, a Korean vodka, but a few sips of one of these led to a hasty order of Italian white. Pinot Grigio goes with cheese.</p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">On a recent Friday night, a Japanese guitar trio played jazz by the bar in front while “Charade,” the 1963 thriller starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, ran soundlessly on a giant screen in back. For a moment, the mountains of Megève—a hint of the Alps—loomed over a room full of cheese eaters, and a semblance of logic passed through the place like a breeze. A couple made out on a couch. At a nearby table, someone recalled the old rule that when you lose a chunk of bread in the cheese you must, if you’re a woman, kiss the man next to you, or, if you’re a man, buy another bottle of wine. The brie-and-basil-leaf fondue was especially viscous and was soon studded with orphaned bits of bread; it was agreed that the blame should be placed on the men. It turns out that Pinot Grigio also goes with melted Belgian chocolate and melted caramel, if you drink enough of it. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $22-$25.) </p>

Barbuto, on the bottom floor of a photo studio owned by Waxman’s partner, Fabrizio Ferri, is an altogether more easygoing place than Washington Park, the short-lived Waxman venture on lower Fifth Avenue that closed last year. There, the waiters wore oxford shirts by Thomas Pink; here everyone’s in T-shirts—except the customers, who seem to know instinctively that this is food to dress up for. </p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">We began, one recent night, with something that will soon be off the menu, since the offerings are seasonal: <em>alosa—</em>or shad roe<em>—alla milanese</em> (it’s not a bad idea to bring your pocket Langenscheidt, or to be prepared to flag down the waiter for a translation). The dish came with lemon and fried capers—their sharpness, and some crisp sage leaves, cut the thick, milky flavor of the lightly breaded roe. The polenta, a standby, was almost liquid, white and rich, topped with a healthy dab of mascarpone.  </p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">It was at just this point in the meal that Waxman came over to the big communal chef’s table in the kitchen to pour more Chianti. “You get the whole megillah,” he said, noting, “That’s a dangerously low level of wine.” Then he went to poke at something on the wood grill—most of the fish and meat is cooked <em>ai ferri</em>. A rib-eye steak, covered in spicy red chiles, emerged, followed by a vibrant orange wild salmon with disks of radish. </p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">The employees often refer to the chef’s table as a place for “Jonathan’s friends,” although anyone can book it, and an atmosphere of conviviality pervades the whole place. Waxman sits down at tables where he knows people, whispers with the cooks, and hangs by the bar wearing his sweater inside out at the end of the night. The rather spare décor has a few homey touches—checkered napkins, scarred tables, a photo of a trophy swordfish hanging on the wall—but nowhere is this unpretentiousness more appreciated than in the presentation of the <em>affogato</em>. Vanilla gelato doused with a shot of espresso, it is served in a tumbler—all the encouragement that’s needed for someone inclined to drink down the melted dregs. (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

In the restaurant’s gastro half, April Bloomfield, a young chef who trained at Chez Panisse and has the know-how with roasted vegetables to show for it, has created a pleasantly unfocussed menu, good for sampling. There’s chicken-liver “parfait” on potato bread, a plate of <em>bresaola</em>—borrowed from the repertoire of Mario Batali, who is one of the backers—and an especially tasty roast-pumpkin salad. The appetizer not to miss is the <em>gnudi,</em> which Bloomfield developed while working at the River Café in London. It’s a kind of pasta-less dumpling of sheep’s-milk ricotta fried golden brown in crispy sage and butter.</p><p data-wc="80" word_count="80">Skirt steak is made exciting by a curious inversion: it’s arranged around a mound of fresh horseradish so big it makes the meat look like the condiment. Decent veal kidneys and a Roquefort burger are among the entrées, but anyone hoping that shepherd’s pie will break out as downtown’s new macaroni and cheese will be disappointed. The shepherd’s pie at your average Irish bar is less bland, and will leave you more money for beer.</p><p data-wc="121" word_count="121">	Speaking of beer, Brooklyn Brewery’s specially made Spotted Pig Bitter is worth a try. The bartender, who wears a houndstooth cap and has twin red star tattoos peeking out from low-rise jeans, will offer to pour you a taste (let her—sometimes the brew is off). The press of the crowd at the bar could be nerve-wracking if the friendly staff didn’t make a point of treating everyone like a regular. Later in the evening, the place thins out a bit, which makes it possible to linger over dessert without feeling guilty. The selection is refreshingly plain: a hard-core chocolate cake drenched in crème fraîche, a wedge of strong ginger cake, a plate of Colston Basset Stilton. </p><p data-wc="56" word_count="56">In a restaurant this size, one party can completely change the mood. At midnight on a recent Tuesday, a high-spirited gang of beauties blew in with their boyfriends, including one character in a double-breasted suit carrying a scuffed leather violin case. They lit up the whole room. (Open for dinner Tuesdays through Sundays. Entrées $13-$19.)</p>

Jay Strauss, an erstwhile photographer who owns the restaurant with a friend from N.Y.U. (they graduated in the eighties), grew up in Oyster Bay. He can reliably be found shimmying through the restaurant’s narrow passages in a well-worn black T-shirt and jeans, pouring water from a plastic pitcher or opening more wine. (He works in the shoebox kitchen four days a week.) The restaurant seats eighteen—here an actress memorizing lines, there a young novelist. One night, a couple sat down to dine and knew the party of four to their right and the party of three to their left, and soon dishes were being passed among the tables—try the bok choy, these stringbeans are amazing—until the whole thing felt like an après-softball potlatch. (“After the Gold Rush” was on the sound system.) Tiny imperfections in the food, you forgive. So what if the fennel is a little waterlogged? Just feel lucky you got a seat.</p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">Burgers and dogs have pride of place on the menu, and the Fearless Frank, from the Niman Ranch, is really something: fit to burst and salty as a dog should be. The waitress recommends it with the chili (mild and almost too fresh—the beans are al dente). The fries are skinny and pale, just like at Mickey D.’s. Chicken tenders, a king-size appetizer, are beyond crunchy, with perfectly cooked middles, and served with chunky blue-cheese dressing or hot sauce. More sophisticated dishes, like trout, with a heavy smattering of finely minced rosemary between the filets, are simple and au naturel: the trout comes with a lemon wedge, a bed of mixed greens, and the head.</p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">In the summer, Strauss gets produce from the greenmarket at Hudson and Twelfth Streets, but even in the in-between months he serves up “Market Sides”—vegetable dishes such as roasted beets and sweet walnuts, snow peas and carrots, and sautéed broccoli rabe. The L’il Devin (an oatmeal-andcranberry sandwich cookie with a cream-cheese filling) and heavenly carrot cake are homemade by Ivy Tack, the only one on the premises who’s been to cooking school. (Open daily for lunch and dinner and for brunch on weekends. Entrées $7-$14.)</p>

You won’t find that mentioned in the current owner’s press kit, but it’s fun to scan the room in the early evening—the only time you can reliably get a table without a six-week wait—and imagine, among the beehived ladies and their tweedy dates, a staff dressed as centurions. Later in the evening, the crowd turns sleek and foxy, making the place seem more in tune with its funky block in Chelsea.</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">Acclaimed in his former posts at Aja, Match, and Mi, the chef Gary Robins has such a deft touch with global spices that he can make a menu with ideas from India, North Africa, and Latin America seem perfectly natural. There’s a lot of ginger—in the cucumber sorbet that refreshes a seared-tuna appetizer and in an improbably wonderful carrot-lobster-and-chanterelle soup. His perfect touch extends to texture, too, the true strength of the entrées: the sage crust on seared duck breast with figs, the wild king salmon with its simple accompaniment of steamed spinach, and the crispy rice coating on the snapper with edamame potato salad.</p><p data-wc="106" word_count="106">It must be hard to resist righteous food-temple seriousness when the food is this good. But the service is formal without being uptight, and the whole operation even seems to have a sense of humor. There’s a cell-phone booth, sumptuously padded in leather, which gets terrible reception. Blocky vinyl chairs can make you feel like you’re driving somewhere in a low-slung muscle car. And, rather than the old Biltmore clock, high up on the back wall above the fireplace there’s a humble little brass-tone clockface that looks like it’s from the dashboard of a Winnebago.

Taking a reservation over the phone, for instance, she commented, “When I went to perfuming school in France they said, ‘You’re never going to sell anything with the name Nunberg!’ So when I was eighteen years old they changed my name to Miriam Novalle.” Novalle is a colorful figure. She is known to berate employees loudly if they, say, spill the precious Angel Pearls (jasmine-scented tea leaves hand-woven into balls, which sell for $7.75 an ounce), and even when she’s not around, her tempestuous energy is palpable. Like the other day, when a giant stone Buddha head that was perched precariously on a ledge dropped to the floor with a concussive thud. Or when one of the waxen Buddhas that line the stairs up to the second floor, where the tea is sold in bulk, came tumbling down, rattling the stacks of china piled up here and there. Nevertheless, Novalle has placed a hopeful little epigram on the menu: “Allow tea and faith to elevate your spirit. Sit and enjoy a moment of heaven.” </p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">Teatime finds a line of people out the door, with impatient husbands pawing the ground like bulls about to charge. (The walls are provokingly red.) For those who order proper tea, a waiter flourishes a pink tablecloth and sets it with purple napkins and pansy-patterned china with a fading gilt edge; then he brings an epergne laden with all that is good about English food: Devon cream and raspberry jam and fresh scones and cucumber sandwiches and countless other delicious items. The surprise is a dry but appealing Earl Grey chocolate cake, and a smattering of peanuts, which seem like the afterthought of a compulsively generous hostess. </p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">The tea selection—well over four hundred choices deep—includes such exotica as Tibetan Tiger (flavored with vanilla, caramel, and chocolate, but somehow not sweet), Snowbud with Rosepetals, and Oolong Ti Kuan Yin (“Iron Goddess”). It would be a pity to order Earl Grey to go with the chocolate cake, but, if you must, there are ten different kinds of Earl Grey to choose from. (Open daily for lunch and tea. Entrées $14-$35.)</p>

The effect is somewhere between Kafka and the D.M.V. There’s a wall of post-office boxes just past the hostess and a case of library-card-catalogue drawers by the coat check; the  lamps above the bar appear to have been salvaged from a grammar-school hallway. The heavy steel bathroom doors have crinkled-glass windows, the meaningless office numbers 306 and 304, and, best of all, working mail slots. </p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">The menus are typed on ledgerlike cards and delivered on miniature clipboards; very efficient, but some of the ingredients sound like they’ve been misfiled. Snails and oxtails are tucked into the same ravioli—never mind the accompanying clutter of pickled shiitake mushrooms, dried tomatoes, pea shoots, and smoked-paprika oil. The snapper succumbs to a cloying purée of vanilla, truffle, and celeriac, and the giant roasted prawns rest uneasily on their bed of al-dente black beans, asparagus, and lump crabmeat.</p><p data-wc="80" word_count="80">Two of the chefs are New Zealanders famous for the Providores, in London, and the kitchen is not unskilled—the main ingredient of each dish can be pretty wonderful. Roast venison loin with fig-walnut chutney and chump-cut lamb with mint yogurt have the least distracting garnishes, and their flavors are superb. If only you could order “kangaroo, medium rare, hold the coriander falafel with tahini-lemon sauce,” or “seared foie gras, no coffee-and-cardamom scone, no candied ginger-lemon sauce, no pumpkin-seed oil.” </p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">Desserts don’t need to make sense the way entrées do, and the peanut panna cotta with lime-wasabi jelly and the chocolate-polenta cake with sweet-corn ice cream are satisfying and kind of funny. The whole thing might be a conceptual experiment on the order of El Bulli, Ferran Adrià’s avant-garde restaurant on the northeastern coast of Spain—without the benefit of a staff chemist. In any case, the lively crowd doesn’t seem to mind. (Open daily for dinner and on weekends for brunch. Entrées $18-$25.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/03/08/dinerbar	Dinerbar	1569 Lexington Ave., between 100th and 101st Sts. 	null	null	null	2004/03/08	<p data-wc="180" word_count="180">A young pioneer who moved uptown from SoHo to Carnegie Hill a few years ago dubbed the neighborhood—defensively, hopefully, facetiously—the “New Bohemia,” or NuBoHo, in an attempt to promote it to skeptical friends. The name, not to mention the sentiment, failed to catch on, and those who pined for NuBoHo were forced to look further north. Dinerbar sits atop a doozy of a hill in what real-estate brokers call Carnegie Hill North—Spanish Harlem, to the rest of the world. The place is spare, roomy, and unassuming: plate glass, ceramic tile, exposed brick, something junky on a big TV, secondhand tabloids by the door. One corner is occasionally taken over by a band or a d.j. There are well-chosen wines and dozens of beers, but no hard liquor, owing to the presence, across the street, of a Life Changers church. The kitchen is open for all to see, and people from the neighborhood drift in and out, in a college-town kind of way. The conversations often seem to be about what happened at Dinerbar the night before. </p><p data-wc="196" word_count="196">What comes out of that kitchen, in giant but prettified portions on big rectangular plates, is diner food, comfort food, square-meal food. (Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are represented, Dinerbar being a 24/7 operation.) There is a list of special sandwich combos named after the people who work there. The most popular, according to a waitress named Colleen, is the Colleen: a grilled-chicken hero with mozzarella, tomato, pesto, and red onion. Another waitress, Leilani, prefers the Big Dan, a chicken club with avocado and bacon on seven-grain toast—which is not to be confused with the Dan, “a cheesesteak with cheese, chili, and bacon.” The cuisine part of the program is only a bit more buttoned up. A whole striped bass, with a coconut-curry sauce and stir-fried veggies—“Would you like the head and tail?”—is worth the work, but there is plenty of great lazy eating: meat loaf, mashed potatoes, apple brown betty. About the pan-seared salmon filet with mango salsa, one diner exclaimed, “This is better than the salmon I had the other day at the Four Seasons.” She paused. “Oops. Shouldn’t have said that!” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $7-$18).</p>

On Raw Tuesdays at this mostly organic vegetarian restaurant, the raw-foods chef Michele Thorne serves up these dishes with wines chosen by Donna Binder, one of the owners: biodynamic Muscadet, organic Zinfandel, and sustainable Riesling. (A quick gloss: biodynamic wines are not only organic, meaning no chemicals or pesticides, but are grown using what one employee called a “more holistic approach”—they might, for example, be harvested according to the cycles of the moon. Sustainable wines are produced organically but haven’t been certified as such by the F.D.A.) </p><p data-wc="259" word_count="259">The regular menu, designed by Thorne and the executive chef, Eric Hunter, combines the raw and the cooked—Cape Cod cakes (crusty fried tofu and seaweed in tartar sauce), wasabi crêpes drowned in a tangerine sauce, a grilled vegetable salad covered in a nut crumble—and attracts a loyal crowd of long-haired sirens so eerily happy-looking and outgoing they might be mistaken for members of a West Coast religion. Which, in a way, they are. One recent evening, a man walked in and saw a pigtailed woman sitting alone on a red vinyl stool at the bar, chatting with the proprietor about organic-food distributors while jotting notes in a burlap-covered journal. She flashed him a euphoric smile. “They have the best food here!” she said. “Do you work here?” he asked. (She said she didn’t.) He sat down next to her, but as she began to point out her favorites—maybe it was hiziki (a sea vegetable) or the rapini salad, bitter and gritty and garnished with peppery coils of parsnip—he realized what he’d got himself into. “No, no, it looks good. Really? Wow, that’s amazing,” he said effortfully as she explained the benefits of eating raw. But he stayed, even when she turned and flashed her smile at someone else. It’s nice to think he might have topped off his dinner with the Banana Split Sundae. God knows what’s in it, but it’s icy, sweet, rich, and very satisfying.

Five years ago, when a former Odeon bartender bought it with a partner, it became the late-night burger-eating capital of Williamsburg. Outside, on a makeshift patio (lovely for brunch in the summer), overturned furniture gives the place an abandoned air; inside, the scant light makes for a pleasantly seedy sodium glow. One recent freezing night, it was possible to squeeze in at the counter between two fellows who might have been regulars—one wearing a T-shirt advertising the Village People’s 1979 spring tour and the other in a snug navy V neck and school tie. A hot toddy for thawing out was ready in a jiff—the bartender whisked it off to the kitchen and shook in a few cloves from an industrial-size cannister.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The menu is winsomely basic and set in a blotchy typewriter font—Soup, Burger, Veg. Plate, 1/2 chicken, Ribeye with f. fries. For diners sitting in one of the little booths, a waitress came to write down specials on the paper tablecloth: escarole salad, a whole dorade, lamb shank with fregola pasta (“round, like couscous,” she said, and drew a little “O”). The chef, Caroline Fidanza, likes things sharp and tangy and on the Mediterranean side. A watercress salad comes with orange slices, feta, and scarlet-tinted pickled onions in a sherry-wine vinaigrette; the dorade is stuffed with lemon slices and sachets of rosemary and thyme; earthy button mushrooms have a hint of white wine.</p><p data-wc="61" word_count="61">Ten-thirty is the witching hour, or maybe that’s when band practice gets out. Suddenly there was an unnavigable crowd packed into the narrow restaurant. The windows turned opaque with steam. The tiles—all original—shone.

This kind of disciplining must turn on the big shots who come here; Leona Helmsley was spotted on a recent Friday night with seven dates and a fluffy white dog to match her floor-length fur. And, while the place is no secret—it’s been written up in publications like <em>Forbes</em> and <em>Crain</em>’<em>s</em>—it’s a surprise to find such a fresh take on Southern Italian food in a drop-ceilinged room in midtown.</p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">The owners of San Pietro (that’s St. Peter the Fisherman, the subject of a ceramic-tile wall piece in the dining room) are four brothers from Italy’s Amalfi coast. The fratelli Bruno—Antonio, Gerar-do, Cosimo, and Giuseppe—have done a good job of making this decade-old lunch favorite feel as if it dated back to the seventies, or even earlier. The specials are recited in thick accents by young waiters who manage to look raffish in their white jackets. They go on in such detail that it’s hard to believe that there’s still a menu to contend with. </p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">The chef, Antonio, gets a lot of his food from the family estate in Salerno. They make a light, mild olive oil from olives picked early and rebottled twice to remove impurities. It’s used raw to marry flavors in complex dishes, so something like octopus with potatoes and stringbeans in pesto doesn’t seem like a stunt. Almost all of the greens are shipped from Italy, making what should be a humble antipasto—fava beans with puntarelle (a type of bitter chicory)—both a luxury and a must. There are more than a dozen pastas and risottos, and, once you realize how deftly the Brunos combine ingredients, you’ll want them all: the scia-latielli (a short pasta, like fusilli left untwisted) made with arugula and basil and prepared with asparagus, clams, and sun-dried tomatoes; the monkfish ravioli with thyme; the cavatelli with shallots and pancetta. </p><p data-wc="78" word_count="78">	It’s hard to settle down to entrées after all that. The big meats, giant chops and racks and T-bones, can be blunt, but the fish dishes shine, especially the snapper on a mountain of mashed fennel and the John Dory in pesto sauce. After dinner a Plexiglas cart glides over like a miniature Popemobile, and the classics are all there, from panna cotta to tiramisu. (Open for lunch and dinner, Mondays through Saturdays.

Bongo is not a fish shack or an oyster bar but, by its own account, a “seafood lounge.” The intimation of laxity is misleading, because this is a vigilant operation, expert in the delivery of top-shelf booze and briny protein. By “lounge,” the owners, Andrea Cohen and Jeffrey Bell, who opened Bongo five years ago (the space had belonged to an exterminator), mean the décor and the low-slung furniture, all assiduously mid-century modern (Eames shell chairs, George Nelson bubble lights, Florence Knoll sofas, a lot of blue and green blown glass). The place would seem precious if it weren’t so easygoing. Often you end up sharing a table or even a platter of shrimp with strangers.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">	Cohen, the voluble one, and Bell, the shy one, do all the work. They make the Martinis, as well as an array of custom cocktails (the Bongo Snowball, the Bongo Gin Ricky) that are large and agreeably lethal. Bell and Cohen will mix you a “mini” if one is not enough and two is too much. They man the galley, too. They chop up the coleslaw and shuck the oysters—tiny Olympias, fat Caraquets, handsome Pemaquids—and prepare the tidy platters of smoked fish or littleneck clams or sevruga caviar. Best of all, they crack the meat out of dozens of lobsters, mixing in scallions, shallots, mayo, and, of course, a secret seasoning before lumping gobs of the stuff into hot buttered buns. If lobster rolls were as cheap as hot dogs, humans would eat nothing else. </p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">	One grand extravagance at Bongo is the lobster-roll party platter—a big bowl of slaw surrounded by a ring of twelve half-sized rolls, all for sixty-five bucks. You tend to keep count of who at your table has had how many; it is advisable to dine here in even-numbered groups to discourage difficult math or excessive displays of gluttony or politeness in the apportioning of shared food. As for dessert, even greedy eaters don’t fight over vodka oyster shooters. Have as many as you need. (Open for dinner, Mondays through Saturdays. Entrées $10.50-$19.50.) </p>

Michael Chow opened this outpost of the Chow empire in 1979 (he considers his original, which opened in London a decade earlier, to be the first “designer restaurant”). It has white lacquer walls and an Imperial Beijing menu that’s distinctly cult of personality: there are First Courses and Of Courses and a dish glossed as “my favorite” (pink prawns).</p><p data-wc="119" word_count="119">	There are also brown prawns and white prawns and green prawns. The green—in a shade as violent as that of a Warhol shadow painting—were said to be Keith Haring’s preferred meal. (His portrait of Mr. Chow, which hangs in the Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills, consists of three seasick-green images of the proprietor wiggling in a bowl of noodles. Chow has said, “Three green prawn heads in a bowl of noodle is not appetizing and somewhat ugly, but then ugliness in art and ugliness in life are two different things.”) If you ask a waiter what gives the prawns their color, he’s likely to mutter something about spinach and remember urgent business in the kitchen.</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">	The noodle chef (sometimes the only Chinese person to be seen) usually makes an appearance around eight o’clock, positioning himself on the upper level and forcing out a hi-<em>ya!</em>-like cry while karate-chopping the air. Then he’ll lift a slab of dough and slam it down athletically until it’s turned to ribbon-thick strands. The noodles, when they’re served, are elastic and covered in an oily meat sauce. They come on a little white dish (main courses are served on silver platters), and you eat them using heavy silver forks with cursive monograms. There are some outstanding dishes—the Cantonese duck, on a bed of peanuts; the squab, finely diced with vegetables and accompanied by a gummy, sweet plum sauce and a sheaf of iceberg lettuce leaves for making your own rolls—but the main attraction is archeological. Here among fragments of Pop art you can breathe the slightly stale air of another century.</p><p data-wc="52" word_count="52">	One recent bitter-cold night, a herd of women wearing minks came in.

What?” From 7:30 <span class="smallcaps">a.m</span>. to the dinner hour, the owners of this third-generation coffee shop keep moving through their onetime superette, from the sandwich counter to the espresso machine, from the oven in back to the big red roaster by the door, grinding beans and chatting with the different shifts of neighborhood coffee drinkers—the librarian and the longshoremen and the O.T.B. guys, the St. Ann’s Latin teacher with the Botticelli tattoo, the proprietors of the Chic Elegance salon next door, the mothers parked by their strollers and nursing their babies and their cappuccinos.</p><p data-wc="118" word_count="118">	The D’Amico family has been roasting beans and greeting customers at this Carroll Gardens address since 1948, and while they do serve food here—muffins, bagels, bialys, ciabatta rolls, and sandwiches or heros to stay or to go—it’s a coffee shop: mostly they’ve got food in case you get hungry while you’re drinking coffee. And this is serious coffee, roasted in small batches, ground in blends of strong, stronger, and strongest (named after Cobble Hill, Park Slope, and Red Hook, respectively), and set out in a row of serve-yourself steel dis-pensers. You pour, you sit, you talk. The fancy stuff, cappuccinos and espressos, they serve you, just right, creamy and strong, in china cups.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">	D’Amico started out roasting coffee, expanded to a superette when they found they couldn’t survive on beans alone, then dropped that part of the business fourteen years ago to concentrate on roasting again. Now they send their stuff out to restaurants and ship Web-site orders, so that even when it’s slow you can hear the old metal scoops in the barrels and smell the fresh grounds. Pictures of the family at work—Emanuele, the founder; his son Frank, in his mid-twenties; and Frank’s son Francis—hang on the wall. Frank, still putting on an apron at seventy-six, greets you at the cash register, where you tell him what you had, on the honor system. “Slow down, slow down,” he says. “I know I look fast.” (Open Mondays through Saturdays. Coffees by the cup, 75¢-$2; by the pound, $5.50-$9.99.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/01/12/matsuri	Matsuri	369 W. 16th St. 	29.799921	-95.4030704166667	212-243-6400	2004/01/12	<p data-wc="84" word_count="84">Matsuri, a vast green tiled vault of a dining room underneath the Maritime Hotel, is designed for gawking. Great sight lines under artfully smashed paper lanterns let you follow the goings on in the ridiculously animated room. The staff trolls through, and the high-living crowd, who go outside to smoke whether or not their entrées have just arrived, constantly exchange hello-again air kisses. The soundtrack booms over it all, an esoteric iPod party mix of sixties soul, Ethiopian funk-jazz, and . . . the English Beat?</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">	The food, by Tadashi Ono, a veteran of La Ca-ravelle, probably wasn’t supposed to be an afterthought, but here the scene and the noise relegate his dishes almost to the level of decoration. The lotus roots in soy sauce, sake, and red pepper are so compulsively munchable that they make you want to watch television. A bowl of hot peppers under a cloud of bonito flakes is exciting, and the slivers of fluke in ponzu strike a nice balance between the refreshing and the harrowingly spicy. The sushi menu is extensive, but the entrée side of the menu is forgettable—lobster miso soup will leave you feeling foolish (really, you should have known), and the sake black cod tastes like fish candy. An entrée just seems like too much commitment in this context.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">	A long sake list is seen to by a lanky sake sommelier, Saori Iino, who is able to distill any diner’s limited sake knowledge into a satisfying choice. And her whispered explanations are mesmerizing: “Very aromatic, with an aftertaste like water, I hope you will like this sake very much please.” Her recommendation of Komekomeshu, from Hiroshima, for after dinner was wonderful, and it rightly overwhelmed the hilarious emperor-has-no-clothes dessert: chilled tofu in strawberry water. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $7-$28.)</p>

(A nearly identical Manhattan branch has just opened at Thirty-fourth and Ninth.) The menu is pleasingly classic, presented on gilt-framed chalkboards and explained by optimistic tuxedo-wearing captains who know the answers to questions like “How much surf and turf <em>can</em> two New York Jets players consume?” For appetizers, there are lamb-chop “popsicles,” sprinkled with bread crumbs, garlic, and rosemary and melting off the bone; bluepoint oysters; nostalgic shrimp cocktail; and a deliciously yielding Buffalini mozzarella in a balsamic reduction sauce. </p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">	You might be full already, but you’ll have to persevere. (Most diners go home with a bag of leftovers.) Porterhouse for two is the specialty, but there’s also the “Flintstone chop”—prime rib with a long bone and a hunk of meat on the end; ruby-red filet mignon, presented with a sprig of rosemary; and sake-massaged Kobe beef. All the meat is cooked perfectly, the char exactly even on both sides. (The one poultry offering is listed under Eclectic Dishes.) For dessert, try the New York cheesecake, which a diner described as “old school”—very dense. </p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">	One recent night, a blonde wearing a glittery reindeer pin sang “Happy Birthday” to her friend, then spilled a drink on her. “You wasted a good ’buca! Whatsa matter with you?” she snapped. At the end of the bar, a slim gentleman nursed a cocktail as he sat beside a mausoleum-like humidor with individual drawers for rent. “Two thousand bucks a year,” he said. The drawers had brass nameplates. Rudolph Giuliani. The Greek. The New York Times. Beepandcell.com. Mayor Bloomberg, whose framed photo, like Giuliani’s, is on the wall, doesn’t have a personal humidor. He is, of course, the reason that Giuliani now must step outside for his after-dinner smoke.

The words “Your financial welfare is the business of this bank” are inscribed in big block letters over the door. The space is tremendous: nearly an acre of marble, forested with Corinthian columns and Jurassic potted palms. The banquettes swallow you up; even tall patrons look like kids at the grownups’ table (a friend measuring six feet five resorted to sitting on the wine list, which has the heft, if not quite the range, of the Hoboken phone book). Waiters in brown bank-clerk outfits patrol the floor like park rangers, though they often seem lost—ask them what’s good and they tell you what’s popular. Rounding out the bewildering atmosphere is the music: boomer pop courtesy of satellite radio. Sting’s hideous ululations on “Desert Rose” bounce off the marble as you chip away at a burger-size terrine of foie gras. You may feel that you are trapped in a Jaguar commercial.</p><p data-wc="93" word_count="93">	So what kind of people come to a place like this? “Circus freaks,” a bartender said the other night, referring to the celebrities who’d recently thrown private parties there. He reeled off some names: 50 Cent, Elton John, Britney Spears, the Stones. Capitale, it turns out, does much of its business in private events. But plebes can eat like circus freaks, too; on the menu, there’s a little portico icon (evocative of Capitale’s façade) next to each dish that’s “available for banquet service in our ballroom &amp; private dinning rooms.”</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">	This invocation of the steam table (and the third-grade spelling) is a disservice to the chef, Fred Brightman. The food, surprisingly, is good. The escabeche, little strips of yellowtail snapper in a citrus vinaigrette, and the upland-cress salad (which in the fall was a sweet evergreen-tomato salad but, no matter the season or the name, is really a barbecued-pork-belly salad) are clever and clean and evocative of smaller rooms and lower ceilings. Among the entrées, the fluke pavé, with chanterelles, spinach, a trace of crumbled pistachio, and a ginger-Kaffir-lime sauce, is the bargain in the bunch; the waiter, citing popular demand, pushes the rib eye—the most expensive dish. So much for your financial welfare. (Open Monday through Saturday for dinner. Entrées $18-$37.)</p>

The latest example is a bad-boy French bistro on the Lower East Side; in theory, there’s an African twist to the place, but, despite the ceiling fans, the tiger-stripe stencils, and the cassava fries, it still falls a few duty-free masks short of a theme. Stéfan Jonot and Vautrin Fabrice, who also run the frenetic Le Père Pinard (where the house special is the feeling that the neighboring tables are having much more fun), have engineered a more inclusive ruckus this time—among the young crowd at the U-shaped bar recently, a middle-aged couple sat comfortably alongside the d.j. spinning Afro-Brazilian beats. </p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">	The couple, if they’d been here before, were probably eating steak: specifically, the unforgettable and unpronounceable <em>korhogofefemougou</em>, which comes with a charred crust of ground orange pepper and kola nuts. The dish was concocted by the Ivorian chef, Abdhul Traore. Such African accents aren’t meant to be authentic—before Les Enfants, Traore cooked haute cuisine at the French and Belgian consulates. But he and the owners wanted to introduce some strong flavors into old standards, a robust approach that works well for sea scallops grilled in bacon with fried plantains and <em>tcheboudjenn</em>, a Senegalese rice. The steak tartare, with fiery Moroccan <em>harissa</em> sauce and fresh mint, is not for purists—it works best as a dip for the handmade taro chips. </p><p data-wc="67" word_count="67">	A few diners trickled in before nine, but by ten the crowd seemed ready to ignore local cabaret laws and turn dinner into a dance party. Don’t be surprised when you call to book a return visit and the host takes no name, saying only, “So, Friday night, you are coming? I am waiting for you!” (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $11.50-$18.)</p>

There’s a fresco of a mother on the wall, under which a little votive candle burns. The food, more complex than what you’d find on Sixth Street or Curry Hill, has an improvised feel—with French influences and the accompaniment of a thorough wine list, it’s like fusion in reverse. </p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">	The chef Suvir Saran says he grew up in New Delhi eating panna cotta made with coconut and mango. He and his colleague, a mustachioed Rajasthani named Hemant Mathur, prepare a range of nimble dishes that reflect the cuisine of much of the subcontinent. The <em>bhel puri</em> is Bombay street food, typically eaten out of a paper cone; here, the concoction of rice puffs, chickpea-flour noodles, potato, cilantro, red onion, mint, and tamarind is served in a neat heap. The spectacularly tangy <em>kararee bhindi</em>—a salad of julienned fried okra, onions, tomato, and cilantro that goes with a fat Sri Lankan prawn—is a delicious preparation that Saran first made with his mom. A cauliflower covered in a tangy ketchup-based sauce was inspired by India’s Chinese population: it tastes like a vegetarian nugget of General Tso’s. </p><p data-wc="68" word_count="68">	Bal K. (Bikki) Sharma, the Nepalese sommelier, tastes each wine on his list with the spices used in the kitchen: mustard seed, curry powder, pepper, tamarind. Bikki, who favors what he calls “New World” wines from Romania, Australia, Argentina, and Chile, is a sophisticated innocent: when the wine expert Robert Parker stopped in for lunch and a glass of Shiraz, Bikki had to be told who he was. </p><p data-wc="38" word_count="38">	Amma’s walls are pale orange, the banquettes are cayenne-red Ultrasuede, and a blurry line of light rims the molding: the light fixtures are wild coils of brass tipped by poppylike shades of orange glass. “Ikea,” Bikki says. </p><p data-wc="71" word_count="71">	The waiters joke with the Indian men coming in for takeout (“I say yes, she says no, and it’s a fight!”), but the hospitality is universal. “E-mail me when you’re coming back,” Saran, milling around in a red paisley bandanna, said to one group of diners. “I’ll make a trip to Jackson Heights and get you some special ingredients.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

The menu is designed for grazing. There’s a slew of appetizers, like <em>pistou</em> and squash-blossom beignets. The fava-bean tortelloni and the chopped mackerel with grapefruit are such carefully calibrated interpretations that the <em>pissaladière</em> comes as an unwelcome surprise: the overly literal translation of the signature dish of Nice is a niche-market mess of onions and anchovies on a thin-crust pizza. The misstep is an exception. D’Amico’s menu is full of strong and unforgettable dishes, like the fries with rosemary and the hamburger with aioli and <em>comté</em> cheese (they call it the five-napkin burger). The <em>boeuf en daube</em>, cooked with hints of orange, is a showstopper in the falling-off-the-bone style. </p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">	Nice Matin differs from Aix and Ouest, its principal rivals on the Upper West Side, in that it serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner largely without sticker shock and aims for a steady local crowd. The strategy is well served by the easygoing wait staff; the sommelier, Guy Goldstein, sent over a flight of dessert wines, and the Scottish waitress, Fiona Pryde, explained that the chocolate-banana tart was so good because the dessert chef was a “chocolate anorak”—a native phrase meaning choco-geek.

With tile walls, low pressed-tin ceilings, clouded mirrors, and marble-topped tables, Schiller’s looks like a Parisian bar from the set of Baz Luhrmann’s “La Bohème,” and it draws a well-heeled crowd that slaps down platinum cards to pay modest prices for McNally’s bistro-style fare. </p><p data-wc="90" word_count="90">	The food arrives quickly. The watercress salad, confettied with pear shavings, walnuts, and blue cheese, is fresh and playful; the whole sliced avocado is voluptuous, drizzled in vinaigrette. The main dishes—such as steak frites, which comes with béarnaise sauce or au poivre, or the swordfish with lemon and mint—are well-seasoned outside, juicy inside. A dense, sticky toffee pudding comes drenched in warm caramel. In keeping with the delusion that the restaurant’s guests are working-class bons viveurs, McNally serves wine in bottles labelled “Cheap,” “Decent,” and “Good.”</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">	Although the place seethes like Times Square on New Year’s Eve, the wait staff doesn’t drop the orders. One recent night, Max, a twenty-six-year-old waiter who went to Penn and looks like Montgomery Clift, discussed the clientele as he refilled a glass with “Decent” red wine. “Geraldo was here yesterday,” he said. “And Martha comes here.” Stewart? “Yeah.” But he’s not starstruck. “I like the regular customers,” he said. “We get a lot of downtown girls with uptown guys in business shirts and jeans from five years ago.”  </p><p data-wc="81" word_count="81">The regular customers can be found at brunch, where the menu is both traditional and inventive: the Welsh rabbit, with a layer of Stilton covered in sharp cheddar, is served bubbling hot on a piece of chewy, sour brown toast and topped with a roasted tomato slice. And at brunch, unlike at dinner, they can get a table without having to wait for two hours. (Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $11-$22.)</p>

The finale, a dessert plate in earth tones, is an exercise in subtlety: a loamy chocolate cake, a green-tea mousse, and a soy-cream mille-feuille, dusted with moss-colored green-tea powder. “It is a very, very, very fine crêpe,” one regular was overheard saying to her date. “Eat it with respect.” (Open Mondays through Saturdays, for lunch and dinner.

Everything on the menu (except, mercifully, the cheese) is canned or cured or in some way preserved so as not to require refrigeration or preparation. In other words, the food is opened, not cooked. This anti-greenmarket approach may not sound promising: you’d think that the foodies had lost their minds. But, in fact, the pantry of the world is full of strange and marvellous provisions that happen to come in tins, jars, or cans, and Cohen and Martinez have set out to raid it.</p><p data-wc="200" word_count="200">	The modest storefront space has a colonial air—mosquito screens, ceiling fans shadowing the room—and is decorated with forty-year-old maps of the continents (the classroom kind that unscroll like window shades). Each item on the menu is listed with its country of origin, so you can find it on the maps as you regard it, with some hesitation, on your plate. From Japan come broiled mackerel, seasoned sardines, and smoked <em>hamachi;</em> from Turkey, pepper dolma (green peppers stuffed with rice and spices); from Lebanon, cheese pie; from New Zealand, big smoked mussels, alongside a sweet tomato compote that takes the edge off the smoke; and from Spain, <em>piquillo</em> peppers, <em>jamón serrano</em>, and cured bluefin-tuna belly, in addition to a selection of nifty cheeses (<em>Garrotxa</em>, <em>zamorano</em>) that come with a fig or quince paste. Everything is served tapas style, on little dishes. The grilled <em>borretane</em> onions from Italy, oily and sweet, don’t seem to suffer much from having spent several seasons in a jar, but the same can’t be said for the marinated octopus (also Italian); it’s so rubbery and bland that you might as well just eat the maps.

Here you have the best of all worlds.”</p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">	The club, an Art Deco monolith near the West Side Highway, opened in June, with a surprisingly creditable steakhouse (apparently not named for the publisher of <em>Penthouse</em>, Bob Guccione, Sr.). The chef Adam Perry Lang—a veteran of Le Cirque, Daniel, and Chanterelle—serves a menu with a calculated emphasis on meat and game (although the iceberg salad comes beautifully dressed, with lemon, olive oil, and blue cheese). Lang sends out lychee sorbet to prepare the palate for his pièces de résistance: venison loin topped with smoked bacon, dense filet mignon, and superb New York strip steaks, aged on the premises. The meat dishes come with a hefty wooden-handled knife, fit for Ivanhoe.</p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">	Although you can see the dancers (or, as the Club owners prefer to say, the entertainers) below and reflected in the iridescent ceiling above, within the snug restaurant itself the appointments are refined: linen tablecloths, monogrammed plates, well-upholstered chairs. Yet, for all Lang’s care, Robert’s may not be the ideal spot for a romantic double date. (She: “The portobello is delicious. Try some.” He: “Look. A couple just went behind the curtain.”) Throughout the dinner, the waiter continually refilled the water glasses from a giant silver pitcher shaped like a tiger. The water poured from the tiger’s mouth. The men never noticed. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $35-$60.)</p>

Kochilas’s meze-centric sensibility shows up in the phyllo pastries stuffed with <em>pastourma</em> and <em>kefalograviera</em> cheese, feta and herbs, or wild mushrooms. She’s also responsible for the green-market flourishes among the classic Greek ingredients: the baby octopus comes seared with fennel and drizzled with orange and cracked olives. Chi has given the restaurant an Aegean color scheme; the cream-and-brick walls are inlaid with the sort of sky-blue shutters you see in Greek hill towns. </p><p data-wc="100" word_count="100">	To a Greek, home cooking can have the flavors of almost any outpost of the Ottoman empire: Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey. The lamb braised in a clay pot is spiced with cinnamon, a recipe of Valtzoglou’s Greek grandmother, who grew up in Turkish I·zmir; the octopus appetizer comes from Crete; and the <em>pastourma</em> comes from what Valtzoglou calls Asia Minor. Some émigrés at Pylos, chasing their dessert with a muscat wine from Samos, knew better. “It’s just typical Athenian,” one of them said.

If you had had a reservation on a recent Sunday night, for instance, you would have received a call in the evening telling you, over the din of an R. &amp; B.-inflected rap duet, that “something came up” and, regrettably, the restaurant would be closing early. If you still managed to slip in for the last seating, behind a group of eight church ladies dressed in monochromatic berry- and cantaloupe-colored suits, two of whom had come “all the way from California!” and who would have been bitterly disappointed if they didn’t get to try the food, you might have learned from a less than canny waiter that Puffy was throwing a bachelor party for one of his friends later that night. That would explain the bouquets of helium balloons bobbing from the railings on the dais-like dining floor and the high-running nerves of the staff. But would it explain why they were out of red velvet cake, again? </p><p data-wc="183" word_count="183">	Justin’s is named after Puffy’s young son, but almost everything else is named after Puffy himself. There is a menu of twelve-dollar Martinis that come in church-lady shades—the Fruit Punch Diddy, the Lemon Diddy, the Passion Diddy, the plain old P. Diddy (“need we say more . . .”)—and one, the Sexy Blue (vodka, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, and blue curaçao), that’s the color of something you wish they’d clean the bathroom with. (The crowd sometimes mistakes the place for a late-night club, and it shows.) The fried-chicken plate—with a side of mac and cheese—is delicious, and so is P. Diddy’s Jumbo Fried Shrimp, which one waiter referred to as the “Puffy Shrimp,” revealing the deep confusion about nomenclature that continues to plague Mr. Daddy. Moguls should probably try the Mogul Combo, a five-appetizer platter that includes cat-fish fritters and B.B.Q. wings and is nicely complemented by the Players Extreme Punch (seven shots and real fruit juices) or a four-hundred-and-fifty-dollar bottle of Cristal.

That dignified old fellow in the next banquette—isn’t that Buckminster Fuller? And what about the woman who stops by his table to say, “I <em>love</em> your offices”? Ayn Rand? It turns out that he’s just another hedge-fund magnate. Still, the sense remains that this strange, gorgeous room could be a chamber in heaven designed for deceased futurists. There aren’t many right angles: the walls are concave, a giant sliding parallelogram-shaped window separates the private dining room from the main space, and the principal motif—repeated on the carpet, the ceiling, the mirrors, the wine racks—is a web of hexagons. </p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">	If the décor is S.S. Discovery meets Honeycomb Hideout, the scene is Korova Milk Bar meets Michael’s. The waiters and bus staff are exceedingly attentive—they have a habit of rearranging the things on your table each time they come by with something new—and above all, they seem to want you to stay hydrated. The saucer of walnut-and-roasted-garlic spread that comes with the bread is tasty enough to get commandeered by one diner after another, until its proper place is restored by the waiter upon his return. </p><p data-wc="164" word_count="164">	The chef, Dan Silverman, who previously worked at Union Square Café and Alison on Dominick, is a greenmarket guy, and it shows in the little things, such as the salad of fava beans, arugula, and Pecorino that accompanies the rack of lamb, or the fried-okra salad with its escort of yellow and green Romano beans. Silverman also does some clever but clean accessorizing at the raw bar—for instance, the little specks of spring onion and the hint of orange on the puck of fluke tartare. Lobster may generally be for tourists, but the grilled lobster tails, with corn, wax beans, and cherry tomatoes, are transfigured by a sweet, cinnamony seasoning—what Silverman calls, half-seriously, “a proprietary blend of spices.” Among the many inventive desserts, there’s something called a dome: a hemisphere of chocolate crème fraîche and chopped cashews. Though not geodesic, it is out of this world. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and weekends for dinner. Entrées $24-$42.)</p>

Seven weeks later, it received a three-star review from the <em>Times</em>, and the crowds headed down to its then-ungentrified Tribeca location. A hefty percentage got lost. “It was like Lamaze,” Tracy Nieporent, a partner in the venture with his brother Drew, remembers. “People walked in and you could see they were under duress. It was our job to soothe them.” The storefront hideaway, which set the standard for a generation of unpretentious American takes on French cuisine, led to a restaurant empire (the Myriad Restaurant Group, which owns eight places in three cities and counting) that left the brothers little time to tinker with the peculiar low-key attractions of the original. </p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">	This benign neglect—or the artful illusion of it—has inspired loyalty in both patrons and staff. The art on the walls, a moody modern grab bag that includes one Frankenthaler and three Sean Scullys, came from artists and dealers who work in the neighborhood and visit frequently. And the chef, Chris Gesualdi, is back for his second tour of duty after an absence of almost four years. He presents the menu’s perennials with piquant details—the roast squab with quail egg, the truffle-crusted salmon with oyster mushrooms, the braised short ribs with roasted parsnips—matching distinct flavors in subtle proportion. </p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">	The food eventually must share the stage with the wine, which is also presented in a relaxed style. In fact, the owners have turned tasting into a game. In “What’s My Wine?” guests can lower the price of a mystery bottle (chosen by the staff) every time they name one of the wine’s six characteristics: country, region, village, grape varietal, producer, and vintage. Nobody’s guessed all six. When one diner, already drinking a delicious Bouchard Côtes de Nuits chosen by the sommelier, raised doubts that the place had any bottles from the year she was born (back in the sixties), the maitre d’, Bruce Yung, said, “Oh, we’ve had wines from the eighteen-nineties!” (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner and Fridays for lunch.

There’s no shortage of establishments that serve snacks of many nations, which tend to be messy, spicy, and eaten standing up. But this minimalist, cool Caribbean café wants to be something more: the kind of place you might take a date to.</p><p data-wc="128" word_count="128">	The one-room storefront, named after nearby Rugby Road, has only two luxuries: broad-plank floors and a collection of scuffed antique lanterns. On cool summer nights, the clamor of the children playing at the little playground next door comes in through the French doors opened to the street. A guy in a uniform of white tank top and blue Adidas track pants—the owner, Phil Davis, a native of St. Vincent—greets everyone as if they were finally arriving at his house party. This laid-back vibe is Rug-B’s strength and its weakness: it extends to the kitchen, whose rhythm can be erratic, as well as to the liquor policy, which is B.Y.O.B.—guests order pineapple juice served in Mason jars, then spike it with rum.</p><p data-wc="89" word_count="89">	The food is island refined with an Asian spin, like the beer-battered shrimp in mango purée, pumpkin tempura with wasabi, or, for dessert, fried banana wontons with sorrel caramel. Some entrées are supposedly inspired by Flatbush’s ethnic mix (like the mixed seafood “run down” with sweet potatoes, coconut milk, lemongrass, and Thai chiles), but the Q-train blend of East and West Indies is better represented by the curry chicken roti, a stew of curried chicken on the bone, loosely wrapped in a delicate Indian flat bread.</p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">	The place, which celebrated its first anniversary in July, has become a busy local clubhouse. Big families push tables together, community groups hold casual meetings, toddlers smuggle in dolls and toy racecars. You can see Davis smiling steadfastly through it, perhaps wondering what he’s gotten himself into. On Sunday nights he hauls the tables out to the back yard, where he serves a robust b.b.q. version of the menu off open grills as a raucous jazz band plays under a string of Chinese lanterns.

It sheds an aura of nostalgic luxury, with a long bar and retro-sleek leather banquettes visible through darkened windows. </p><p data-wc="67" word_count="67">	Jennifer Kohns, who opened the restaurant last October with Lawrence Rudolph, trained at Judson Grill and Le Bernardin, and Rudolph trained at Joe’s in Venice Beach, California, but in designing their neighborhood hangout, they put relaxation first. Once patrons walk into the main dining car, or past a row of trees to the roomy back garden, a surreal mood sets in, deepened by flickering lantern light. </p><p data-wc="58" word_count="58">	The menu is simple. A single page offers “Snacks,” “Vegetables &amp; Greens,” “Cheese,” “Main,” and “Sweets.” The fare seems to have been chosen by a discerning globe-trotting backpacker: Monte Enebro cheese from Spain paired nicely with Iberian rosé, Caribbean guava-pork-and-<em>queso</em>–<em>blanco</em> empanadas, Mediterranean-style grilled baby octopus, or, back on home turf, two ears of grilled corn with chipotle aioli. </p><p data-wc="117" word_count="117">	The muscular wait staff seem more likely to ask “Should I check the oil?” than “How is everything?” But once the “Main” arrives, wherever it is you’re meant to be, you’re staying. The food is lightly exotic: the grapefruit-poblano-and-peanut salad goes well with the roast blue snapper; the best thing about the Thai lemongrass chicken is the crêpes that hold it. Those who can’t stay for the <em>churros</em>, served hot with a milkshake they call “frozen hot chocolate,” can duck over to the newly verdant Christopher Street pier to pick up some brownies and homemade cinnamon ice cream from the Lunchbox ice-cream cart.

Still, on one of these dog-day nights, with the sun setting hazily down the cross streets, it’s reasonable to crave a little breeze and a view that is not comprised entirely of right angles. In which case you basically have two options: you can go out to the ballpark or you can go up to Tubby Hook.</p><p data-wc="169" word_count="169">	Tubby Hook Café lies at the foot of Dyckman Street, where it runs into the Hudson River, about a mile north of the George Washington Bridge. It truly is right on the water. There’s a beer garden abutting a marina and a wooden patio that extends out over the river. There’s even a little beach. On a recent evening, the bar was occupied mostly by Red Sox fans—or local Dominicans rooting for Pedro Martínez in a Sox game against the Yankees, on TV. The better view was of the New Jersey Palisades, and the sun sinking behind them, and of the bridge, where you could see that the lower deck was the way to go. The Cloisters, just to the south, were bathed in orange light: a sort of commuter’s alpenglow. A couple of guys on WaveRunners swerved around in the current. Kids played in the grass. Salsa played loudly. The waitresses brought tin buckets filled with ice and bottles of beer. <em>Pura vida.</em></p><p data-wc="141" word_count="141">	There’s always a catch, of course, and at Tubby Hook, unfortunately, it’s the food. You don’t expect much—it’s basically a summer burger shack—but that still doesn’t prepare you for the dish-towel deep-fry they try to sneak by you: prawns, potatoes, fish, and chicken, all of a sogginess suggesting that they have been dipped in the river itself. Even a longtime batter fiend found himself pushing aside the pale pods of shrimp and ordering up extra rounds of the Dominican pilsner, Presidente, instead, to ensure that his beautiful evening included an adequate number of calories. The burgers and hot dogs, however, were fine, as burgers and hot dogs usually are. Night fell and the dancing started and the Presidentes came and went, like so many buckets of oats.

Many restaurants try to fill this vacuum, but none does it so well as Harry Cipriani, which has provided diners with an almost nostalgic sense of not belonging since 1985. The cozy room in the Sherry Netherland, with its gold-stitched linen curtains, is generally bustling, but still intimate enough to overhear the elegant Indian woman exchanging phone numbers with Denise Rich, the waiter shouting in Spanish that they’ve run out of sport coats, the general manager letting a couple know that a Venetian count has taken care of their check.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">The general manager, Hassan Elgarrahy, dominates the room, boasting about his time in the marathon (2:34!) and herding cowed waiters with a variety of Cagney-like shoulder rolls and head feints. The waiters, who move in squadrons, dodge eye contact or disappear for long stretches, then show up suddenly to present the food. Their Old World lack of ceremony leaves patrons time to notice little things, like the people who came in later getting their food first.</p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">Cipriani descends directly from Harry’s Bar in Venice, the Lost Generation joint that invented the Bellini, a mixture of Prosecco and white-peach purée that still attracts the big spenders. Given the air of studied indifference here, the food comes as a surprise. The appetizers—seared scallops or the spicy tuna tartare with a frizz of mâche—have kept up with the latest culinary fashions, but the entrées have a time-capsule quality. The hearty portions are presented as Hemingway might have got them—charred steak-house sirloin, grilled branzino, a plate of calf’s liver <em>alla Veneziana</em> boldly uniform in its liver color—accompanied by the sort of boiled vegetables you might expect at a Republican fund-raiser. Their throwback deliciousness, like the banker décor, recalls the Eisenhower era, when food was uncomplicated and proteinaceous and roughage was viewed with Red-scare suspicion.

Zerza compensates for its new-kid outsider status (it’s the only non-Indian palace on this East Village block) with a menu that’s politically correct in the extreme—there’s even a nod to Israeli cuisine in the form of spinach, feta, and pine-nut <em>bourekas</em> (the most popular appetizer). But the multicultural smorgasbord has its share of traditional Moroccan staples, too, including eight separate lamb dishes. There’s lamb with artichoke and peas and lamb with apricots, prunes, and almonds. For Sunday brunch, there’s spit-roasted lamb served with Moroccan pancakes. “Lamb is king!” explains the owner, Radouane ElJaouhari. </p><p data-wc="188" word_count="188">	The atmosphere in this two-story night-life complex, despite its rich red walls and heavy incense smell, is less opium den than East Village genteel. Upstairs in Zerza’s airy, minimalist dining quarter, with its wooden tables and banquette, nose-ringed Oberlin grads talking about Dean’s chances in 2004 sit across from black-haired Eurasian beauties in halter dresses and their rich older husbands with tans and gold watches. Downstairs, the addictive dance music of Cheb Khaled and other Arabic artists plays over a scattering of wicker sofas, tile tables, and leather hassocks that seem designed to make you feel incredibly short unless they’re piled on top of one another. In keeping with the “innocent decadence” theme, one of the house specialty cocktails, the Casablanca, tastes suspiciously like summer-camp bug juice but turns out to be composed of a near-lethal interplay of triple sec and rum. Considering the expanses of bare midriff on display this summer in the city, even Zerza’s Saturday-night belly dancer, with her tastefully beaded belly and flowing cape, seems a little quaint.

Collins’s new place stands out improbably like an oasis of blue velvet, chiffon, and crystal. The spacious restaurant, which has acoustics that make quiet conversation possible everywhere, is divided into a long, modern bar, a curtained central lounge that recalls the inside of the “I Dream of Jeannie” bottle, and an airy, rather opulent dining room. “I was thinking of those Georgia-style mansions with chandeliers hung everywhere, and a cast-iron fan in every room,” Collins says.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">But Collins doesn’t come from Georgia; he was raised in Texas by his great-grandmother Ida Mae. She was the person who first got him cooking. When he was seven, she had him lug home a freshwater bass that was bigger than he was, clean it, and serve it up for the family. “She told me, ‘Never depend on a woman to cook for you,’ “ he says. He took the lesson seriously, and went on to study French and nouvelle cuisine with Paul Bocuse and Peter Schaffrath, in London and Dallas. Still, when he opened his Manhattan restaurant last month, he dipped into his Southern repertoire for the menu. “You know the way it is nowadays,” a waitress at Ida Mae says. “It’s down-home. But high-end.”</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">The result is smoky-sweet Southern comfort food dressed up with well-judged French-nouvelle flourishes. Sweet-potato stuffing fills ravioli rounds in a chive beurre blanc; sautéed cremini, chanterelle, and oyster mushrooms balance between cracker-like platforms of baked pasta. The Chilean sea bass cured in brown sugar lies on a bed of dirty rice and stewed tomatoes, and the pork tostaditas are presented in generous tapas-style portions. “My great-grandmother could not have cooked this food,” Collins says. “But then, I’m the one who did the cooking.” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner.

Usually you’ll find it parked at the crest of the steep hill on Lexington at 102nd Street, in Spanish Harlem. Guerilla marketing theory holds that once you’ve seen it seven times you will soon be on the phone ordering tacos—beef, chicken, chorizo—without benefit of a menu or even Pataki-calibre Spanish. </p><p data-wc="4" word_count="4">“Anything else besides tacos?”</p><p data-wc="3" word_count="3">“Tripe.

The place is snug and tidy: red and white carnations on the tables, Los Tucanes de Tijuana on the jukebox. The salsas are served alongside little bowls of sliced radishes and limes. The guiding principle is “authentic Mexican cuisine” (that’s written on the truck), with all the usual food groups (chalupas, tamales, tostadas, and so on) and very few sops to the Señor Swanky’s set. (A second El Paso opened on Ninety-seventh Street near Madison Avenue about a year ago; the menu is similar but not identical—you can get <em>huitlacoche,</em> a coveted corn fungus, there—and the clientele is a bit more Carnegie Hill.) The dishes can be deceptive. The <em>sopes</em>, which consist of homemade corn tortillas topped with beans, sour cream, <em>queso fresco</em>, and some form of meat (spicy pork, for instance, but, alas, no <em>tripas</em>), have synergy; they’re far tastier than the sum of their parts. The flautas, fried tortilla flutes filled with beef and <em>cotija</em> cheese, are unaccountably airy. Among the <em>platos típicos</em>, the <em>cecina asada</em>, or salted beef, looks and fights like jerky but is somehow both softened and fortified by a covering of nopal cactus and onions. There is the usual array of sweet, sweet desserts—flan, rice pudding—but, if you’re lucky, as you’re soaking up a mole with the last of your tortillas, the neighborhood ice-cream truck will pull up at the hydrant just outside. It’s authentic, too. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $5.95-$12.95.)</p>

You may concede Dufresne’s point—that his food would fit right in at an art gallery—but then you wonder, Is it really an appetizer?</p><p data-wc="91" word_count="91">	Luckily, the chef has perfect pitch in the kitchen. Cherries hid under a red mullet in a peppery nasturtium sauce. The square of foie gras came with silver anchovy topping and raw cocoa nibs. In the artichoke soup, a tiny quail egg balanced on a thin crisp of chorizo. This sort of culinary adventurism can often feel forced, but Dufresne’s touch is light, nuanced, and full of surprises. His octopus appetizer, for example, tasted like a grownup version of the flame-grilled hot dog—wistful, witty, a ballpark recollected in tranquillity.</p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">	Four big-party private booths line one wall, but the patrons in the center of the room are close enough to comparison shop. Peeking at a neighbor’s plate, however, can be flummoxing. The spring chicken, which is first bound in mesh and marinated overnight, emerged from the kitchen looking like a pair of boccie balls and accompanied by a mysteriously round poached egg under a froth of “pumpernickel jus”—impossible to figure out without consulting a waiter, but delicious, and full of distinct mix-and-match flavors. Unfortunately, this do-you-get-it attitude loses something when it’s extended to the rest rooms downstairs, where an expanse of blank wood wall cleverly disguises three unmarked and knobless doors. It can take minutes to realize that you have to push the wall—a Mensa-test experience so disconcerting that one diner wound up down the hall in a storeroom. Another made it in and then forgot to lock the door—probably not quite the see-and-be-seen experience that WD-50 is striving for. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $22-$28.)</p>

Red-topped malt-shop tables and banquettes nestle around a bar with a marble soda-fountain countertop. A table lamp and a telephone sit at a corner of the bar, as if they were on an end table in a family room. Eating at Lovely Day is like having a picnic indoors, where, instead of lemonade, the drink in the cooler is an Asian mojito, made with crushed mint, brown palm sugar, fresh lime juice, and sake. </p><p data-wc="173" word_count="173">	Jibiki came to New York from Japan a decade ago with an art-school background and an instinct for style. In 1993, while she was studying business at N.Y.U., contacts in Tokyo asked her to find a relatively unknown New York fashion designer and introduce him to Japan, and she chose Marc Jacobs. Her restaurant draws Jacobs’ sort of people: lithe, quiet scenesters who blend well with the surroundings. The men look like cleaned-up members of the Strokes, the women have Pilates bodies, and both sexes wear graphic T-shirts, cropped cotton biker jackets, and cargo yoga pants. They eat her food—coconutty Bangkok curried noodles in soup, cabbage nori, and what the menu calls “Delicious Flank Steak” teriyaki or “Comfortable Dish” (sautéed vegetables with chicken and rice)—but they linger for the feng shui and dessert and tea. The best quirks of fusion show up in such Westernized sweets as the fried rice-crêpe rolls packed with hot banana, for dessert, or, from the brunch menu, the buttermilk pancakes with lime-palm syrup. </p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">	Jibiki, who has long, shag-cut, tea-dyed hair and a soft way of talking, works behind the counter or walks among the tables, looking like a patron who’s helping out. As friends from the neighborhood saunter in for pad thai, she offers a cheek to kiss and starts mixing their drinks. “People think it’s a noodle shop, but it’s something else,” she says. “It’s just what you want to eat.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

Clarke’s was the swell’s last stop of the night and the lush’s first: it was the inspiration for Nat’s Bar, in “The Lost Weekend,” and Richard Harris used to go there directly from the airport and order up six double vodkas at once. It isn’t easy for an establishment as legendary as this hundred-and-nineteen-year-old saloon to survive an ownership change and a thorough renovation without coming in for some abuse from the regulars. But the new owners—a group that includes Timothy Hutton, the actor, and Philip Scotti, the owner of Docks Oyster Bar and Sarabeth’s—have given it a good shot. They’ve preserved everything from Jessie (a stuffed dog that has presided over the front room since the fifties) to the famous, towering urinals (“You could stand Abe Beame in one of them and have room to spare,” Frank Sinatra, an old regular, supposedly said). There was some grumbling over Jessie’s move to the back room (she’s been returned to her original spot), and the urinals, which are now illuminated with track lights, look like Matthew Barney installations. But, to be fair, all that the new guys did, besides completely overhaul the building’s innards, was spiff up the joint. They even kept the old menu, with its unorthodox pricing ($15.15 for the fish and chips). </p><p data-wc="203" word_count="203">Now it’s a scene again, though for a different set. One is reminded that this little brick boxcar of a building is surrounded by office towers. The new bosses brought in a few bartenders who have a loyal East Side following, and the aged cranky waiters have been replaced by a squad of smart-alecks in thick-rimmed eyeglasses. The biggest change may be that you can’t smoke, an indignity you can’t pin on Tim Hutton. (There’s also a fancier restaurant upstairs, Sidecar, which employs the speakeasy gimmick, in vogue these days, of being accessible, by a separate door with an intercom, only to members and to diners with reservations.) Still, once you’re seated in the back room, amid the old wood and bevelled glass, you concede, sentimentality aside, that there ought to be more places like this in New York: killer chili, supreme bacon cheeseburgers, spinach salad, shepherd’s pie, all escorted by an armada of frosty mugs. The fish and chips—a big batter-fried filet of sole with frites, preferably doused in malt vinegar—manages to be both pubby and delicate, like a Boddingtons ale rendered in solid form.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/06/02/taste-5	Taste	1411 Third Ave., at 80th St. 	null	null	null	2003/06/02	<p data-wc="120" word_count="120">Forget the first impression: Taste is a deli by day, filled with strollers and salad eaters and cappuccino sippers. At three, the place shuts down for a few casual changes (tables get flowers and tablecloths, the bar gets chip baskets) and returns at six as a fine-dining option for a largely local crowd. If you’re in a dressy mood, the whole thing can seem like a letdown at first, but have a handful of the house-made chips, take a flier on some wine by the glass—say, the crisp New Mexico champagne—and uncharitable thoughts disappear. Eli Zabar’s marriage of wine store and greengrocer has produced a comfy market-menu restaurant with a sophistication that sneaks up on you.</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">	With everything that’s available to him, the chef, Scott Bieber, is right to keep things simple: the rooftop-tomato salad, sliced and salted, from Zabar’s second-floor greenhouse, tastes as good as road-stand tomatoes in August. The baby-spinach salad is positively newborn. This elemental presentation of the food encourages the matchmaking of friend and vegetable, and sure enough, on a return visit, the chef devised a special onion lover’s menu of charred-cipollini-onion salad, buttermilk-batter onion rings, and a rack of lamb with Vidalia-onion pudding. Of course, the willful onion lover traded the lamb for the aged rib-eye steak, the house specialty, which is suitable in size for a Diamond Jim Brady.</p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">	Taste has a wine merchant, Jonathan Laufer from the store next door, who has put together a remarkable list of out-of-the-way wines by the glass (Weininger Grüner Veltliner, Muga Rioja, Woop Woop Shiraz) that he will pair with the food, course by course. On both visits, Dorothy Czub, a waitress with a hey-hon manner and the savvy of a river guide, laid out the best paths through the menu and even dropped by after the dessert (a lemon-meringue cake that looked like Madame de Pompadour) with a bag of candied grapefruit that extended the noshfest through the cab ride home.

As an example of what that means in practice, a casual young couple with two kids threw a party there for thirty of their friends before the place had been open a month: Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">	Newton and his designer, Ilan Waisbrod, seem to have blended the white-shoe pedigree with Palm Springs cool. And Newton’s Chilean-born chef, Germán Cáceres, knows how to preserve the silhouettes of the svelte and muscular patrons. He worked as a personal chef for Wesley Snipes and Denise Rich and has a sure instinct for male and female diet imperatives, which he indulges Valparaísan style: brawny fare for men, bird bites for women.</p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">	On the Rich side, there is a delectable coarse-cut salmon tartare and a <em>merluza</em> (Pacific hake) ceviche, flecked with sweet potato, corn, cilantro, and jalapeños. On the Snipes side, there’s Chilean sea bass on coconut-milk-sopped basmati rice, studded with bananas—Wesley’s favorite, Cáceres nervously confided. The thick pork chop is pan-fried so tenderly that it tastes braised, and it comes with macaroni and cheese mined with flavor bursts of mangoes, apricots, and prunes.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">	Some of the guests never make it past the sleek bar table, shaped like a surfboard, that hangs from the ceiling on guy wires. Since their taste for being seen is at least as strong as their desire to be fed, they dive into the teeter-totter bar menu, offsetting a tomato-and-Idiazábal-cheese tart with frisky “shrimp shooters” that come with a shot of gazpacho. Both go down well with the house Cosmo, made from <em>cachaça</em> and blood-orange purée, or the house Martini, made with Ciroc, the latest French vodka, which, judging from the ad campaign (“Your good taste shows through the glass”), is just right for this crowd.

For Moonen and the growing number of chefs around town who got their sea legs upstate at the Culinary Institute of America, a fish isn’t anything until it’s been accessorized nearly beyond recognition.</p><p data-wc="66" word_count="66">	Forget broiled or baked—Moonen’s creations are apt to come wrapped, as in the potato-clad walleye with pickled ramps and truffle-leek emulsion; or encrusted, as in the seven-grain-coated salmon, with English peas, gnocchi, and morels; or steamed, as in the halibut with fava beans and porcini oil in a mushroom foam. (That Moonen has succumbed to the foam-fetish epidemic comes as something of a surprise.)</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">	Despite the fussiness, he uses only the freshest raw materials—the oysters on the half shell and the yellowtail <em>crudo</em> seem to have been harvested within the past hour—and his silky combinations are never jarring. The butter-poached lobster, for example, with leeks and potato in a smoked-tomato broth, banishes any nostalgia for a Maine shore dinner. But in other areas, RM is comfortingly traditional: the service is warm and efficient, and the desserts tend toward the indulgent (the “peanut butter variation” consists of brown butter cake, milk-chocolate mousse, banana sorbet, and salted peanuts). And there are a few dishes on the lunch and dinner menus in which the seafare is readily identifiable. The woman who wanted her fish plain settled for gulf shrimp on a bed of fresh fettuccine, and she had no complaints when it arrived tossed with butter and caviar.

A post-fire renovation four years ago gave the dining area an Artie Bucco sheen—cream color-washed walls, framed prints of grapevines and ancient urns—but the place still has a little Tony Manero left over. A few weeks ago, on Good Friday, you had cops on lunch break, waitresses on loan from the Wagner High cheerleading squad, and counter guys grooving to the Bee Gees’ “More Than a Woman” as they tossed the dough. Joe Pappalardo, the owner, whose salt-and-pepper hair system deserves to be mentioned on the chalkboard alongside the specials, greeted the regulars, most of whom seemed to be named Joe, too. (Pat Pappalardo, Joe’s brother, left the business in 1974 to start up a Century 21 real-estate office down the street.)</p><p data-wc="204" word_count="204">	Let the record show that Joe and Pat’s doesn’t just serve pizza. There are nine spaghetti entrées and six varieties of veal, and Joe’s son Angelo, who trained at Esca in Manhattan, makes a mean whole roasted bronzino. But the pizza’s the thing, and the plain cheese pie is the proving ground. Needless to say, it passes the napkin test: there’s no grease to soak up. The crust is crisp and very thin, with little moons of mozzarella (and a supposedly heretical dusting of Romano cheese) floating in a fresh, slightly sweet tomato sauce. One good thing about pizza like this is that you can eat a lot of it, which means you can guiltlessly take a shot at, say, a Joe and Pat’s Royal (pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, mushrooms, anchovies, peppers, hold the scungilli). The Royal manages to stay fresh even after it has cooled for an hour in its “God Bless America” box. Good thing, too, because apparently there is something of a tradition among men returning home after a visit to Joe and Pat’s: you bring your wife a pie or you get locked out.

His first engagement there, Domingo’s, lasted five years, but the encore closed in just two weeks, so this time around the famous name is off the marquee and the portrait of the restaurateur as El Cid has been replaced by sandy-white walls with seashell-and-palm-tree bas-reliefs. More faux palms, woven into fans, rotate lazily overhead. The waiters wear guayabera shirts; the setting is now, someplace by the sea. </p><p data-wc="188" word_count="188">The seafood menu, under the direction of Richard Sandoval, of Maya, is strictly upper-class Mexican, a refined mestizo blend with traditional elements, like tomatillo salsas and chile pastes, interpreted lightly. There’s a guacamole to start, but the smoked marlin provides a more seaworthy and adventuresome dip. The tuna ceviche (closer to a sushi in salsa than a true citrus ceviche) comes with mango and a hint of <em>chile poblano</em>, and the lobster tacos, in perhaps the finest performance in a seafood appetizer this season, balance black-bean purée and a smoky <em>chile de árbol</em> salsa in dark counterpoint to the lobster chunks and avocado shavings. The order has three; do not let dining companions imagine that you’ll share. The entrées can feel like too much of a commitment after that—the signature dish, pompano steamed in banana leaf, is beautiful to look at, but boring in the long haul—although that attention-span deficit might also be due to the <em>copas especiales</em>. The Pampano margarita comes in various shades of fruit, either virgin or, if not, with a selection from the pick-your-poison slate of connoisseur tequilas. </p><p data-wc="84" word_count="84">At the end of a recent meal, two things brought the attention sharply back in focus. The first was dessert; all four choices, especially the <em>pastel de elote</em> (a sweet corn cake) and the chocolate taco, were sophisticated treasures. The second was the arrival of the <em>divo</em> himself, who sat down to dine around ten. Naturally, he ordered a Pasión—a mix of tequila and passionfruit. This time out, he has something to toast.

With no patience to wait for pâté to be put en croûte or for bevies of quail to be tucked under pastry coverlets with hothouse grapes, the invaders shouted “<em>Bystro!</em>” (“Quickly!”) at French tavernkeepers, and, lo, steak-frites were born.</p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">	At Brian McNally’s Café Lebowitz, at Elizabeth and Spring Streets in Nolita, the blended Franco-Russian heritage of the bistro is everywhere in evidence. Burgundy leather banquettes, dark wood tables, flickering sconces, and wide, smoky mirrors say France; cream-colored walls decorated with folkloric stencils and Constructivist prints and leaflets say Russia. The menu has been contrived to satisfy the most ravenous muzhik with simple fare prepared with finesse and invention.</p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">	The beet, the most beloved root vegetable of the Russian people, appears as a first course, served with grapefruit segments (a marvellous pairing); the roasted chicken comes with loops of sautéed leeks spaded into its center. Even the humblest item on the menu has unusual character: the hamburger arrives in a toasted brioche bun, alongside a steel cup of garlicky fries shaken with parsley, which have a butteriness that boosts the side dish to escargot calibre.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">	The food at Café Lebowitz may arrive <em>bystro</em>, but the high-spirited, talky clientele eats <em>medlenno</em> (slowly), basking in the conviviality of their surroundings and in the satisfactions of their dinner. Until this month, these included tobacco. McNally named his restaurant after his friend Fran Lebowitz, the writer and ardent smoker, but now their “Café Lebowitz”-stamped Zippos must be retired. “I think it’s madness,” McNally says. “All the staff here smoke.” And so do most of the habitués. “Clearly, if this were the will of the people, the smoking would go on.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

When the patron nodded, the woman lowered her voice to a hush. “He died five years ago,” she said. Nanni’s easy-to-miss establishment, just east of Grand Central, still hides behind a battered awning under a while-u-wait income-tax agency. It remains a monument to a time when “real” Italian dining, New York-style, meant a décor of sunny travel posters and tasselled table lamps, black-jacketed waiters, and specials that offered slight variations on menu items (veal scalloppine—with prosciutto and sage). Some years ago, the posters gave way to frescoes, but otherwise the owner and chef, an intense figure the size of Willie Shoemaker, would find things just the way they were in 1967, when he opened for business. </p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">	Since the tiny, austerely furnished dining room is generally packed with people who seem to regard it as a second home, a night at Nanni can become as clamorous as the roast-lamb scene in “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.” But once the parade of classic dishes begins (risotto with wild mushrooms, swordfish with capers, chicken with garlic, tomato, and peppers), things settle down to a comfortable roar. A recent dinner for two included capellini in brodo, or angel hair in a rich golden broth; arugula and endive salad; squid in a spicy tomato casserole; a massive veal chop; and the zabaglione that Nanni used to make at the table. “Has anything on the menu changed since Nanni died?” the waiter was asked. He thought for a moment, then said, “No. Why should anything change? It’s Italian, isn’t it?” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner only. Entrées $18-$29.)</p>

There is something pleasantly cultish about the place: the old speakeasy entrance, the bartender who is said to be prejudiced against beer, the exceedingly chipper waitress, and the frequent invocation, among staff and patrons alike, of a character named Dan, as in “Dan would like you to try these poached shrimp” and “Dan’s a nice guy.” It helps to know that Dan is Dan Barber, the owner and co-chef, who named Blue Hill after his grandmother’s farm in the Berkshires. It’s true: Dan, once you meet him, does seem nice, but the important thing to understand about him is that he and his co-chef, Mike Anthony, like to work with produce that’s in season, and that they do so with flair but not too much fuss. </p><p data-wc="188" word_count="188">	At Blue Hill you used to be able to order a “mystery wine,” a bargain bottle selected nightly by the sommelier and served in a burlap sack. Its identity was revealed only after everyone had knocked off the contents and hazarded some guesses. (Getting it right earned you nothing except “glory and satisfaction,” Dan says.) They don’t do this anymore (the wait staff groused), so now the tricks are just culinary: a thin green romaine-and-parsnip soup, served in a shot glass with a topping of Parmesan foam; a crabmeat lasagna, with a squadron of mussels in a sauce of mustard and spinach (a gloss on the classic crab cake); or squash ravioli, with what seems to be a lump of chestnut in each ravioli. There’s always a selection of raw seafood, with adventurous accompaniments: Arctic char with, say, pea-shoot vinaigrette. Dan and Mike seem to be ardent poachers: two of the best entrées are salmon poached at a low temperature in duck fat, and a gamy skinned duck, poached in a spicy carrot stew. Both are airy, tender, and delicate, and come with funky broths. </p><p data-wc="71" word_count="71">	Even the desserts call for close attention, if not participation: the other night the waitress made it known that Dan wanted the table to try something that combined three lemon things: a shot glass of lemon gelée, lemon-curd ice cream, and baked lemon curd. It was called a “lemon study,” which sounded like work. Still, Dan is Dan, so lemon study it was. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $23-$28.)</p>

In Cobble Hill, it’s 242 Court Street, a mid-block shoebox with tin ceilings and exposed brick—exactly the sort of no-frills setup that thrives one block east, on Smith Street. Over the past few years, the curse of 242 Court has claimed Rustic (mussels in a broth of zatar), Harvest East (salmon and pastrami with cucumber jelly), Mojo (lobster wonton), some couch-and-coffee joint that specialized in slacker hauteur, and a nouvelle-tofu pita stop—all of them gone and gone quickly, like Spinal Tap drummers.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">Enter Jean-François Fraysse of La Lunchonette, the chef who turned a windowless place across from a busy Eighteenth Street bump shop into a sure-thing Chelsea bistro. Fraysse, who learned French farm cooking from his grandmother in Quercy, fights the curse with an irresistible menu that duplicates Lunchonette’s down to the typeface and the daily specials written on chalkboards. The restless, this-plus-that fusion of previous tenants gives way to a well-practiced rendition of the French paradox: sautéed foie gras, boeuf bourguignon, and Château Quercy, or sweetbreads, steak au poivre, and a bottle of Cahors. Naturally, Fraysse’s blessed tarte Tatin, in both apple and pear versions, reappears in Brooklyn. All of the fare is rough hewn and served with assurance.</p><p data-wc="127" word_count="127">But the identical-twin menus make you concentrate on small differences. In Chelsea, the front door faces an open kitchen and you step into <em>caveau</em>-like warmth; at Quercy, there’s nothing inside to stop the rush of cold air, and patrons, even at tables by the back wall, shiver at every new arrival. At La Lunchonette, the lack of windows is part of the speakeasy charm; Quercy’s big front window looks out on a liquor store and oncoming traffic. But Fraysse, who has been spotted counting dinner receipts and wandering through the place in a warm leather coat, seems blithely unaware of any defects. Perhaps this Gallic disregard is just the thing to break the curse. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $12.50-$21.50.)</p>

Superfine is run by three old friends, Tanya Rynd, Laura Taylor, and Cara Lee Sparry, who started throwing “Superfine Supper Clubs” in the apartment they shared, then turned their flair for dinner parties into a business. “We built out the entire restaurant space ourselves,” Rynd said, done up for the Sunday bluegrass brunch in a cowgirl shirt, orange silk pants, geranium-red lipstick, and blond curls. </p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">	The women subdivided the former vacuum-cleaner-and-car-parts warehouse into a string of cozy burrows. The sunken wooden bar in the middle looks like the hold of a ship, and the restaurant rises around it, with paintings and photographs on one side and an orange felt pool table surrounded by matching airport-terminal seats on the other. The friends split the work: Rynd takes care of the art and the bands, Sparry oversees the bar and the d.j.s, and Taylor does the cooking.</p><p data-wc="59" word_count="59">	Superfine’s seasonal, Mediterranean menu stresses organic vegetables, fresh fish and squid, and grilled cuts of meat served with unusual sides, like beet greens or winter pea shoots. Taylor gets a lot out of simple dishes; the yellowfin-tuna steak is sushi-grade, and the vegan soups are flavored with hyperconcentrations of asparagus, butternut squash, or the légume du jour. </p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">	Best of all, Superfine actually cares about brunch. Every week, the owners fly in green chilies from Albuquerque, which have a creamy texture and a cactusy flavor, to make a sauce for the breakfast burritos, the quesadillas with spinach, and the mahimahi, which is rolled into soft flour tortillas textured with fresh crushed corn. Chase this with a salty dog—their version has fresh-squeezed ruby-red-grapefruit juice and Stoli in a salt-rimmed glass—start listening to the Flat Broke String Band playing “Amazing Grace,” and you may find yourself staying through dinner.

Famous signatures are all over this misnomer of a restaurant, which seems to have been designed for first-class space travellers who like lots of elbowroom. The drawings that line the circular lounge, which serves meals to drop-ins up to eleven o’clock, are by Matisse and Giacometti. The colorful, backlit panel at the far end of the dining room is a stained-glass copy of Léger’s “Les Constructeurs.” </p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">The chef, Julian Alonzo, is similarly pedigreed. His mentors include David Bouley and Guy Savoy, and, though most of the old-time brasserie standbys are on hand, the menu encourages you in boldface to go for concoctions on the order of Asian tuna tartare with passion-fruit cream and fresh wasabi, or the truffle-crusted loin of lamb. Simplicity is the better route. (The seafood tartares tend toward the gummy, and the striped bass all but disappears under a crust of horseradish.) The kitchen does particularly well with such classics as a côte de boeuf with bone marrow and pommes soufflées, and a roast chicken of which any Lyonnaise <em>grand-mère</em> would be proud.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">	One of the architect’s most felicitous touches is the mirrors, one to a booth, which are tilted to enable the museum-quality clientele to people-watch without staring. Still, there may be a bit too much aesthetic largesse. On a recent evening, an order of drinks took twenty minutes to arrive. When the waiter was asked what had delayed him, he grinned and gestured toward the Léger. “Isn’t that great?” he said. “I stopped for a look at it on the way.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner.

It isn’t often that you’re considered a foreign national seven miles from home, but such is the Dominican dominion over Dyckman Street and the distance from midtown to Inwood. On a recent Wednesday night, this slick new pan-Latin restaurant was quiet—there weren’t many Americans, Dominicans, Dutch, or anyone else for that matter. The waiter, though, was full of assurances that on weekends the place is <em>encendido</em>, especially in the night club upstairs, a gleaming lounge of marble and glass that suggests high times and horrible acoustics. The chef, Ricardo Cardona (who learned some of his tricks with the Nuevo Latino<em> </em>pioneers Douglas Rodriguez and Alex Garcia), emerged from the kitchen to report that the Sunday crowd usually kills off his entire supply of Cristal champagne and Johnny Walker Blue (at $400 a bottle). After midnight he serves various <em>asopados</em>, big soups that hold off hangovers.</p><p data-wc="167" word_count="167">	A couple of evenings later, on a Friday, the dining room at DRK—the restaurant recently changed its name from Republi’K, after the owners of Republic, a Union Square noodle house, threatened legal action—began filling up after nine: girls’-night-outers, a few hot dates, one zesty posse of fat dudes in track suits, and two lone diners (a sullen young woman in arm-length black lace gloves and, a few tables away, a man wearing a string of Mardi Gras beads over a dark suit). The overhead lighting was coercive, fading at random intervals from South Beach pink to Santo Domingo blue, and it seemed to call for touristy cocktails—Dominican mojítos, spicy margaritas, guana-Patróns—and order-more-than-you-can-handle eating. Along came an army of appetizers: <em>arepas</em> with braised short ribs, coconut-crusted shrimp with a mango-ginger sauce, Martini glasses brimming with ceviche, and, for the romantics in the house, <em>pinchos en fuego, </em>which are skewers of meat you heat up yourself over a sputtering Sterno flame. </p><p data-wc="102" word_count="102">	Among “<em>los clásicos de Washington Heights</em>” is a rich, chunky, tomato-based Dominican seafood soup, another drinker’s palliative. Other excellent entrées are the grilled skirt steak, wrapped around a mound of mashed <em>yautía</em> (taro root) and served with three <em>chimichurri</em> sauces, and a tender roast pork shank the size of a carburetor, with an onion-and-garlic <em>mojo.</em> The waiter nominated <em>mar y tierra parrillada para dos,</em> which sounds exotic but is in fact just surf and turf—heaps and heaps of grilled meat and seafood. No great shakes, but safe, perhaps, for Americans. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $14-$34.)</p>

Last spring, while walking his kids to school, he spotted a vacant space directly opposite the Brooklyn Academy of Music and said goodbye to Central Park West. “It was that simple,” the longtime outer-borough resident told a few diners admiring the cozy, mahogany-and-wrought-iron atmosphere on a freezing winter evening. “It’s not like I have something against the Upper West Side.”</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">The Viennese, according to an actress from the Shakespeare-and-Chekhov doubleheader across the street, are “not exactly big on the veggies.” Ferlesch’s <em>gulyash, which piles braised beef cheeks over spaetzle with a pickle sidecar, is confidently light on green distractions, as is the towering pot-au-feu, short ribs with marrow in consommé. Still, Ferlesch does delicate things with fish and fowl, and his Gallic-nuanced menu may confuse customers expecting a more unilateral Viennese approach. One BAM patron fresh from a screening of African-diaspora films asked the chef, “Isn’t pot-au-feu, like, French?” “No,” Ferlesch said, adjusting his earring. “Boiled beef is very much part of Viennese culture. French is just easier to understand.” </em></p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">Dessert is part of Viennese culture, too, and Ferlesch’s Linzertorte is compulsory, though all the choices—such as the crêpes gilded with apricot jam or the <em>Milchrahmstrudel of farmer cheese in an artery-blocking vanilla sauce—compliment the Mozart <em>Kaffee, a caffeine-and-crushed-almond number that does a lot to explain the maestro’s hyperactivity. After polishing off a second bottle of Blaufränkisch, one group seemed especially happy to see their <em>gulyash reëmerge from the kitchen in a doggie bag big enough for two more dinners. Ferlesch looked pleased, too. “It’s the same dish I used to serve at Café des Artistes for $28,” he said. “Same beef, same supplier, same portion—only here, it’s half the price.” (Open daily for dinner and weekends for brunch.

According to the owner, Jupira Lee, a first-generation Korean-Brazilian who has lived here for thirteen years, home is where you eat typical Brazilian food—because you have maids. “Like in the morning, you wake up, around ten-thirty, eleven o'clock?” she says. “You always smell beans cooking. It's one of the things you miss.”</p><p data-wc="62" word_count="62">There are no bright subtropical touches at Casa to lure the crowds; the candlelit corner restaurant fits right in with all the other nineteenth-century houses down this quiet Village street. Still, passersby can take one look through the latticed windows and recognize a distinctly sunny plantation atmosphere. The small place is often comfortably crowded with a mix of Villagers and Brazilian expats.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">The appetizers address the crowding problem: several of them make for ideal finger food during the wait at the bar—the <em>salgadinhos</em>, fried shrimp, chicken, or cheese pastries that come with a fresh and wicked jalapeño dip, or the <em>frango à passarinho</em>, garlicky chicken nibbles on the bone. Some patrons will insist on having wine or beer to go with them—both are on the menu—but a better choice is the <em>caipirinha</em>, a worldly cousin of the margarita that uses <em>cachaça</em> in place of tequila and is served with fresh mint. Have five.</p><p data-wc="135" word_count="135">The menu acts as a summary of regional fare. The meatloafy shrimp cake is a São Paulo specialty; the seafood <em>moqueca</em> with squid, shrimp, and fish has Afro-Brazilian touches like coconut milk and <em>dendê</em> oil typical of Bahia; the chicken with garlic, tomato, and okra is straight from Minas Gerais. Like the <em>feijoada</em>, a bean-and-dried-beef dish that comes with a platter of fresh orange, rice, collard greens, and the toasted manioc grain called <em>farofa</em>, these hearty platters are deceptively light. And who is it who pulls off these marvels? “My chef is a woman from Minas Gerais,” Lee says. “Her name is Maria, Dona Maria.” And her last name? “I don't know. She's Dona Maria. It's the name of a good cook.” (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $15.95-$19.95.)</p>

The décor slyly taps into both Asian and Western ironies. The bar is a glass-topped rock garden and underneath its surface—beneath the ginger kamikazes and sojutinis—moss grows among smooth black stones and collages that look like Dadaist beer mats. One reads: “The gods get bored with people who have no stories.”</p><p data-wc="78" word_count="78">Kori’s chef and owner, Hyanghwa Kim, a former stage actress in Seoul, resists the fusion label, although her cuisine does strive for a truce between North and South Korea. “My family-in-law is very conservative, and I married the oldest son, so as his wife, I had to cook for all the family members, sometimes thirty people,” she says. “My family-in-law comes from North Korea, and I come from the south, so I blend the recipes for both.”</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">The dumplings in Kim’s <em>mandu guk</em> soup have tender, thin wrappers that let the beef exhale its full fragrance (“I add sticky-rice flour to the dough”). The <em>insam</em> salad is an island of shredded celery and ginseng on a sea of puréed Korean pear and sharp mustard. As the waiter serves each plate, he asks, “May I stir for you?” before disassembling the still-life. One entrée stands out: the <em>jang</em> uh, a fillet of grilled, smoked eel steeped in a sauce that takes Kim twenty-four hours to prepare. At about twenty times the payload of the typical <em>unagi</em> roll, it’s more eel than most people have ever seen, but in its soy-apple-lemon glaze and paired, for example, with the spicy <em>duk bokki</em> rice nuggets it goes fast.

With all the latticework and these Moroccan pillows, it looked like a chic decorator's shop,” said a woman whose midwinter tan and Chanel suit suggested that she knew a chic decorator or two. Getting up from the pillows where she had been waiting for her companion, she bumped her head on the turbanlike shade of a ceiling lamp. “That's a mistake,” she said to the hostess who led her into the dining room, where still more latticework and pillows awaited her.</p><p data-wc="178" word_count="178">The chef at Pazo, Patricia Yeo, successfully borrowed from Pacific Rim cuisine at AZ, in the Flatiron district. In midtown, she turns to the Mediterranean basin to give patrons a taste of the old spice routes without actually booking anyone's cruise to Tangier. Yeo and her co-executive chef, Pino Maffeo, are big on bold contrasts, the more the merrier, and the results are mixed. Recent successes include a surprisingly well-married soup of curried red lentils and fennel, a chicken tagine accompanied by a coriander-spiked couscous, and a brilliantly orchestrated paella of duck confit, seafood sausage, and jumbo shrimp, in a rice pilaf. But other dishes—the smoky grilled octopus in a spicy orange reduction; cannelloni of duck confit, mushrooms, and winter vegetables; and bacon-wrapped monkfish with arugula and oxtails braised in harissa—read better than they taste. Desserts, the best of which may be the silky Catalan cream with beignets, tend toward the rich and fussy. The noise, in the low-ceilinged, intimate space, is tolerable, and a note in the menu discourages the use of cell phones.</p><p data-wc="64" word_count="64">But if the food is variable, it all looks designer-great. When the Chanel-suited woman ordered a “torchon” of foie gras and homemade fig newton as a starter, a bas-relief of an exotic flower arrived, the roots and bud joined by a stem of thickened balsamic vinegar. “It's beautiful,” the woman said, “but is it edible?” (Open for lunch and dinner.

This clever new restaurant on the Upper West Side, a neighborhood barren of ambitious cuisine until very recently, is many steps removed from the daily produce market under the sycamores of Place Richelme in Aix-en-Provence. The chef, Didier Virot, formerly of Virot and Jean-Georges, employs the ingredients and combinations of southern France the way Coltrane used Rodgers and Hammerstein. There’s a pistou here, a tomato tarte there, and quince everywhere, but there’s also a lot of elegant horseplay.</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">Aix is laid out on three levels, like a tackle box, and the walls are painted yellow and red. The waitresses wear dowdy brown-and-red outfits—like barmaids in Arles, one supposes, or Brownies. The dishes, though, look smart. This isn’t tall food, but there are many instances of sauce art. And it’s diverting, while trying to make a terrine of sautéed, pistachio-crusted foie gras last, to sample tastes of each of the surrounding three sauces (a pistachio vinaigrette, a balsamic vinegar, a peach coulis) and then to swirl the colors around on the plate. The trio of flavors (and the messy plate) help you overcome the nagging feeling that some of the food—say, the raw-tuna appetizer, thatched with cucumber and bullied by a horseradish-yogurt sauce—is fussier than it needs to be.</p><p data-wc="62" word_count="62">Another sauce worth dipping a thumb into is the cocoa-coffee reduction that comes with the hunks of venison. With venison, generally, you want something sweet. But Virot’s cocoa-coffee sauce is almost bitter, veering pleasingly toward Vegemite, and the sweetness is furnished by a quince-beet strudel. The result is something both hearty and sly, like many of the best things at Aix.</p><p data-wc="95" word_count="95">Dessert, on the other hand, is all trickery. “The pastry chef is a little odd,” the waitress explained. Odd how (good odd or bad odd?) she wouldn’t elaborate. Examples of both appeared: a so-called Provence salad, a layered stack of sugared green tomatoes and candied celery with a mint sorbet, was top notch. The other was a licorice panna cotta with a “tangerine tartare.” To approximate this one at home, you might try brushing your teeth with Tom’s toothpaste, then drinking a glass of orange juice.

They're often joined by fresh-faced women who look like they've just descended an Alp, but Mondays through Wednesdays, the men tend to shun female company—the better to make use of the foosball machine in one of the restaurant's two cavernous rooms.</p><p data-wc="168" word_count="168">Sylvester Schneider created Zum Schneider two years ago to evoke the macho gusto of his native Munich: I did it because of homesickness, he says. When he couldn't find room for an outdoor beer garden, he took the party inside. The place has vaulted ceilings, and an archway garlanded with ivy divides the space. Gingerbready wooden window frames lend a fairytale touch, and diners gather around long oaken tables, devouring sausage and drinking mugs of Bavarian beer on tap: light and dark lager, pilsner, and hefeweizen, as well as the northern brands Jever and Kölsch. The menu bursts with wurst—juicy veal <em>Weisswurst</em>, plump bratwurst, and thin <em>Schweinswuerst</em>'<em>l</em> (all from Schaller &amp; Weber)—served with such German standards as <em>Blaukraut</em>, spaetzle, and hot, crispy <em>Reiberdatschi</em> (thick, oniony potato pancakes with applesauce). Other Teutonic stalwarts include schnitzel, <em>Schweinebraten</em>, and roast pork, which come bathed in tangy beer gravy. Something called <em>Schwammerlragout</em> is excellent: a bread dumpling bathed in a wine-and-cream sauce studded with slices of nutty mushroom.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">Zum Schneider also serves the traditional German breakfast (<em>Frühstück</em>), seldom seen on these shores, which includes homemade chewy <em>Brötchen</em>, thick brown bread, sweet butter, honey, jam, sliced cold cuts and ham, tart yellow cheese, pickles, and soft-boiled eggs. Skip the orange juice and have a mug of coffee, or—<em>warum nicht</em>?—a breakfast lager. It's the perfect start to a day of vigorous <em>Biervergnügen</em>.

By night, it's a valet-parking trattoria with a gift for excess: Thursday and Sunday evenings, for example, opera singers in business attire serenade the diners tableside. Day or night, it's a volume business.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">The food is all very <em>vincerò!, vincerò!, vincerò!,</em> stagy and built for big Italian wines. The salad of field greens, usually a demure choice of appetizers, arrives looking like an endive warhead until you slip off the tiny garter of red pepper at the top and the whole thing collapses in a frilly spread like a cancan dancer. Among the pastas, the Oscar goes to the fettuccine all'Antonio, with prosciutto and truffle oil, which is pushed out on a dessert cart and is tossed right in front of you, inside a big wheel of Parmesan cheese. The wines, mostly small-production labels such as Sagrantino di Montefalco and Begali Amarone that go well with cured meats, prove that the importers, Frank Galano and his son Anthony, take their working vacations seriously. In a similar spirit, the waiters make a production out of decanting them.</p><p data-wc="132" word_count="132">On a recent opera night (they substitute Neapolitan music on Tuesdays and Wednesdays), the place was full, mostly with dressy, First Communion-style family gatherings that filled the room with a raucousness that rivalled the Russian tenor's. The big seatings temporarily cut off access to the back wall of refrigerated display cases—but get friendly enough with your neighbors and they might pass you a cheese or a salami to add to your bill. One comfort that no one should skip is the chocolate pizza, which is a sort of Italianate improvement on the Pop-Tart: a core of Nutella between two thin layers of crispy crust, all of it covered with powdered sugar and an Expressionist choco-drizzle.

At lunch the other day, only a few elegant fossils of that better-turned-out period graced the beige banquettes in the entranceway. Instead, midtown professionals without ties or casually dressed couples in their early thirties sat on the main floor in mostly cowed silence, amidst the Dufy-like murals of Parisian parks and the imperturbable flow of waiters removing silver lids and deboning fish.</p><p data-wc="219" word_count="219">But despite those <em>quenelles</em> (as ethereal yet shockingly rich as ever) and a few other old-timers such as Dover sole with mustard sauce, La Caravelle's menu has moved with the times. A little more than a year ago, the proprietors, André and Rita Jammet, hired Troy Dupuy, an executive chef schooled in the <em>cuisine sans frontières</em> philosophy of Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Gray Kunz, and he has given the classic French menu a virtually flawless facelift. An appetizer of marinated tuna and gravlax gets a tangy crunch from a mango vinaigrette and a layer of seaweed. Another opener has to be the most sophisticated baby dish in town: a cup made of taro root containing tiny vegetables and covered with crisp phyllo. Among the entrées, lily bulbs lend a certain exoticism to sautéed quail breasts, and Jerusalem artichokes and pomegranates turn out to be ideal companions for a saddle of venison. In the makeover, the grande dame has even acquired a sense of humor. After a patron commented nostalgically on the display of venerable Fifth Avenue shopping bags at the coat-check booth, one of two women behind the counter wisecracked, “We're just a couple of old bags ourselves.” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner and Saturdays for dinner.

But Grace and Jack Lamb, who on their first date both confessed to dreams of owning a restaurant, aren't interested in restraint. “I wanted bamboo and elegant, sexy lighting,” he says. “I wanted it to feel luxurious and warm, like a jewel box,” she says. Eighteen months ago, they opened their tiny Japanese grotto on the site of a former video shop on East Fifth Street. “We're here every night,” Mr. Lamb, formerly of Bouley and Danube, says. “It's our baby.”</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">The couple hired the Japanese architect Hiromi Tsuruta, who painted the concrete outer wall the color of morels and cut it with a low strip of glass. Inside the cool hideaway, a curving tunnel of bamboo rods casts a green, watery light over the room, and gray velvet banquettes hug the walls. Mr. Lamb, an Irish-Italian-American in a dark suit and designer frames, and Mrs. Lamb, a Korean-American in sleeveless silks, move among the patrons. As she stops to explain a special or he stoops to pour a bit of <em>ume shu</em> (rice vodka flavored with Yamaguchi plums), his hand grazes her forearm, her hand brushes his shoulder.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">In the back of the restaurant at the sushi bar, chef Masato Shimizu sculpts fish into still-lifes: an amuse-bouche of wild surf clams, lightly poached, arrives on a bed of chrysanthemum petals. Tasmanian-salmon sashimi, pin-striped with fine yellow lines, appears on a ceramic palette. Strips of belt fish lie on a julienne of daikon radish that tastes of hearts of palm. The Lambs' pleasure shows all over the menu, but nowhere more than in their playful selection of sakes—from the ladylike Cherry Blossom Water and the Very Gentle Genshu to the Devil's Quivering Tongue, which, it turns out, tastes like ouzo.

The salt snob (houndstooth sports coat, Canadian accent) peeked into the kitchen, via a mirror on the wall. “Also, I can see a blue box of Bazini walnuts, and behind that there’s a red box. I know that red box.” He voiced his astonishment at the lack of fleur de sel (the salt of the moment).</p><p data-wc="159" word_count="159">The other diners conceded the point, not only because the place is named after the stuff, but because in most respects, Melissa O’Donnell, the chef at Salt, seems so meticulous. Salt used to be called Stella; last fall, O’Donnell, one of Stella’s three partners and a former chef at Le Zoo, reopened it with a stripped-down seasonal menu. The other night, each table was adorned with a gourd in a cachepot, and someone had written on the mirror, next to the list of house wines, “It’s autumn! Eat butternut squash, beets &amp; bread pudding.” Among the autumnal appetizers, the most startling was the cream-of-cauliflower soup with portobello mushrooms and truffle oil: it went down like a milkshake. The Salt Guy declared the risotto, with Parmesan cheese, caramelized onions, and baby leeks, “brothy and underdone”—but he was overruled. (Around this time it was also determined that the red box in the kitchen was not salt.)</p><p data-wc="109" word_count="109">Salt’s house gimmick is that half the entrées are listed as “protein + 2,” meaning that you can order, say, a whole dorade or a roasted duck breast, then choose two side dishes from a list of seven (leeks, slow-roasted eggplant, butternut-squash purée, pearl barley, and so forth), but it is hard not to let the chef just do the work. When the waitress came around with the main courses—a braised lamb shank with merguez sausage and white beans; a bold, smoky roasted salmon with chorizo and barley; veal saltimbocca with prosciutto; and just one protein + 2—the Salt Guy said to her, “Tell us about the salt.”</p><p data-wc="112" word_count="112">She blushed. “The salt will be more interesting next time you come,” she said. “Good salt is hard to find. Everyone says ‘Fleur de sel, fleur de sel.’ But Melissa didn’t want to do that.” Chastened, the Salt Guy tucked into his veal (not as rich as he’d hoped). Everyone else was quite happy, and, not long afterward, the woman across from him knocked over her glass, spilling red wine on the sleeve of the houndstooth jacket. No problem: Salt Guy knew how to deal with the stain. “Ah, salt!” he exclaimed, dumping a bunch of it on his sleeve. (Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $12.50-$21.)</p>

The dishes, meant to remind you of Tuscan home cooking, come at a Continental pace, gracefully slow; you don’t feel neglected, you feel as though you’re on vacation. And the wines on the restaurant’s small list, from the Super Tuscans and Sangioveses to the <em>vino da tavola</em> served <em>al consumo</em> (a wooden dipstick tells you how much you owe), are well chosen and affordable. All this is laudable. But what you’ll be talking about is François.</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">François Louy, the co-owner and maître d’, comes from Milan by way of Harry Cipriani, with a stage presence that’s Mastroianni by way of Benigni. (His wife and co-owner, Catherine de Zagon Louy, from Florence via Balthazar, watches serenely from the bar.) François shaves, by the look of it, every other midnight; he accessorizes his Italian sports coats with mismatched Converse sneakers; and he addresses his customers with a brand of reprobate charm that sounds all the better with his Milanese accent. When one woman asked for a glass of <em>prosecco</em> before ordering, François quickly said, “For you, the world.”</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">The Louys have also imported a confident Italian chef, Michele Baldacci, who works out improvisational menus full of fresh, unexpected pastas and organic-meat dishes. During recent visits, the cold antipasti came with a venison salami. The thin, delicious Piedmontese beef, cut in strips, arrived undressed, on a bed of fresh arugula. The tagliatelle with porcini, which appeared at the table by mistake, was an ideal and daringly simple combination of mushrooms and pasta. Through it all, François presided, guided, and cajoled. After one table couldn’t decide between the cheese plate or dessert, he proclaimed, “Cheese plate,” and left. Later, he justified his brusqueness to the happy cheese eaters: “One day,” he said, “you’ll trust me.” (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner and Sundays for lunch. Entrées $6.50-$19.50.)</p>

They opened just in time for Bastille Day, so perhaps it's not surprising that the newcomers were French: Tabac, Épicerie, and Café Charbon. Tabac, sandwiched between the other two, looks like a Parisian newsstand—the glass front displays neat rows of film, magazines, and cigarettes—but it's only a decoy foyer on the way to the bar, Café Charbon, and the bistro, Épicerie. No matter; very few patrons show up without cigarettes.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">Café Charbon is a dark, embracing room with high, wood-beamed ceilings and a long bar. In the back, a d.j. plays an eclectic blend of music, from Frankie Valli to the Violent Femmes; people dance in their seats as they eat their <em>moules.</em> Stage left,  a wall opens onto Épicerie, a cozy place with Camembert-colored walls, wide louvred blinds, and votive candles. The patrons there can watch the goings on in Café Charbon (and vice versa), and the same rich, savory, and low-cost menu is served in both places, until midnight on weekdays, and until four in the morning on weekends—salvation for local revellers sober enough to remember that steak frites at 2 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span> can prevent an aching head at noon.</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">The two establishments draw a bohemian crowd, but the menu is refreshingly peasant: spicy olives, cheese croquettes, crumbly homemade duck pâté. <em>Escargots à l'ail</em> loll on tiny butter-drenched pieces of toast, and <em>saucisson sec</em> comes on a white plate, as is. There's even a selection of <em>plats ouvriers</em>—working man's specials such as sautéed kidneys or sausages with cabbage—very simple entrées for about twelve dollars. But it wouldn't be French without a frill or two. The confit of duck and browned potatoes shows up in the saucepan it was cooked in, and one of the desserts, the <em>omelette Norvégienne</em>, is positively libertine: a <em>boule</em> of ice cream, lightly caked, dropped in meringue, and flambéed tableside with Grand Marnier. You could put it out and eat it, or use it to light your cigarette. (Open daily for lunch and dinner; Fridays and Saturdays, until 4 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span> Entrées $10-$21.)</p>

But in this hopping six-week-old establishment in the Flatiron district, these clichés have been raised to a new level of sophistication. The design, which landed on the front page of the <em>Times’</em> House &amp; Home section, domesticates a bank-size main dining room with amber-lit earth colors, semi-private booths, and hand-carved wooden pendants, which glow like jack-o’-lanterns. A more intimate back room is open for less clamorous dining. According to a spokesperson, the name (“Two Roads”) refers not only to the restaurant’s location on Park Avenue but to the menu, which is “classic Mexican in a contemporary style—no lard.”</p><p data-wc="169" word_count="169">Standouts among the appetizers are two vibrant seviches—one with red snapper, scallops, and spicy mango, the other with bigeye tuna and a salsa of chile and citrus. The chicken enchilada deserves a more elevated name, given its lusty marriage of spit-roasted fowl with a tomatillo-serrano salsa and Oaxacan cheese. The best of the grilled dishes may be a beautifully blackened heap of charred shrimp, accompanied by a mole of pumpkin seeds, poblano rice, and sautéed watercress. The desserts are as richly indulgent as a Mayan altarpiece. And to ease it all down you can take your pick from more than a hundred and fifty tequilas. The executive sous-chef, Ross Gill, says that personal taste inspired the menu. “Last summer,” he says, “the chef, Dudley Nieto, and I spent six weeks in Mexico, sampling local restaurants in different regions, from Puebla to the Yucatán. We took the food we liked best and brought it back to New York.” (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $15-$24.)</p>

With its desultory juice bar, mirrored halls, and racks of rubber sandals, the damp and subterranean hangout can seem at times like a parody of a certain kind of health club, but in the end there’s nothing clever about a good steam—or a good meal. The restaurant, if you can call it that, is just upstairs from the swimming pool. It’s a panelled room no bigger than a trailer, with a TV in one corner and—though alcohol is not served—a neon Bud Light sign in another. “My uncle is distributor,” the waiter says with a shrug. “It’s nice light.”</p><p data-wc="198" word_count="198">You may dine while dressed in a bathrobe, if you like; in fact, you may stop by the restaurant to order, then head downstairs to dawdle for a while in the steam room and the sauna. By the cold-water dipping pool, Eugene, in a Speedo, might offer <em>platza</em>—a therapeutic flogging with a hot bundle of oak leaves. It is better on an empty stomach, he says, “but if you must eat first don’t eat too much.” Back upstairs, it quickly becomes clear that this will not be easy. An abundant layout awaits: cuts of pickled herring, with tomato, cucumber, onions, and olives; a bowl of Olivier, a potato-and-egg salad mixed with carrots, capers, dill, and mayo; <em>kharcho</em>, a light lamb soup, with hunks of meat, seasoned with paprika; lumpy borscht; a cup of <em>ikra</em> (salmon roe). Sauces correspond to certain dishes, but ignorance yields lively combinations. In place of beer, the spa offers up <em>kvas</em>, a nonalcoholic Russian soda, which looks and tastes like Coke mixed with stout. The other diners, mostly Russian men in V-neck sweaters and leather jackets, pay no heed to the <em>mestnye</em> in sandals and terrycloth robes. Infomercials spool by on TV.</p><p data-wc="76" word_count="76">Soon decision time arrives, with more platters. What will it be, the <em>platza</em> or the blintz? A sound thrashing, or a Cornish hen, cooked on a double-sided grill, and a plate of Siberian <em>pelmeni</em> (tortellini-like dumplings)? Within minutes, your restorative outing has turned gluttonous; what you have just sweated out you are now taking in. Later, you see Eugene again, and mutter something about having to cancel the <em>platza</em> appointment. “Is okay,” he says. “I understand.”</p>

Neighborhood regulars (including celebrities like James Gandolfini and Sheryl Crow, couples with Shirley Temple-quaffing children, and a carpenter or two) return often for hipped-up comfort food like buttermilk fried chicken, a truly great house-cured, double-cut pork chop (one night it came with fire-charred peaches, on another with garlic mashed potatoes, mustard greens, and mission figs), good grilled steaks with beer-batter onion rings, and oven baked pasta (a.k.a. lasagna). The rest of chef Marc Meyer's Mediterranean-influenced menu changes daily, according to what looks good at the market, so there are always surprises. But after three years in business the place is otherwise so suspiciously overlooked that it makes you wonder if there is actually a neighborhood conspiracy to keep it under wraps. </p><p data-wc="212" word_count="212">It's not just Meyer's menu that changes often—it's also the décor, or more specifically the elaborate floral arrangements. On a recent night, four-foot-tall bouquets of pale-green hydrangeas lined the split-log fountain that runs through the center of the candelit arched dining room, and a roasted-fig salad with Maytag blue cheese and toasted almonds and lobster-and-shrimp fritters with aioli were the desirable appetizers. A few nights earlier, deep-green magnolia leaves filled the huge vases, and the menu included wood-oven-roasted bluepoint oysters with butter-braised leeks, tea-smoked trout with honeydew, avocado, and mint, and a seafood brodetto with fava beans. (Meyer is a big fan of favas—what more do you need to know?—and once turned them into hummus for the mezze plate.) His daily soups are simple and wonderful: English pea with Riesling and crème fraîche; cauliflower purée with Parmesan croutons. And there are always several kinds of raw oysters to start, as well as a serious rotating selection of olives (Bitettos and Castelvetranos from Italy, Nyons and Picholines from France). Dessert is probably good, but who knows? Finishing with one of the salads or another appetizer always seems like a better idea. (Open daily for dinner, Sundays for brunch and dinner. Entrées $17-$25.)</p>

At seven-thirty, four waiters buzzed around the sole table of diners; at the bar was a couple who'd dropped in for the drinks and, apparently, to discuss astrology. If I were a Cancer, a woman told the smiling hostess, who had made the mistake of revealing her sign, I would have killed myself a long time ago. . . . I hope you have an outlet.</p><p data-wc="288" word_count="288">She should also hope that the Basil will catch on the way its two Village relatives, Holy Basil and Little Basil, have. There are plenty of dishes on the small menu whose presentation, freshness, and not-too-alarming ratio of invention to tradition make the place, along with a good wine list, exceptional among Manhattan's Thai restaurants (it's also a bit more expensive, but it's worth it). The main courses are substantial, so starting off with a lighter appetizer is not a bad idea; the green-papaya salad (shredded in a cylindrical mound atop tomato and a couple of nicely grilled shrimp, in fish sauce and lime) is appetizing in the true sense of the word. It is perfectly fine to skip the soups, but if you must have a dish reminiscent of the familiar stuff that arrives at your door by bike, the noodles are good, especially the egg noodles: they come in a star-anise-and-cinnamon broth in which bok choy and beef that has the texture of good brisket have been stewed; it's all topped with thin slices of very rare beef. The entrées include terrific fish dishes, a porterhouse steak with sautéed morning glory, frog's legs with pickled bok choy, and a moist Cornish hen with mango salad. But the two big winners are marinated rack of lamb, whose double-cut ribs come really rare if you request, with sautéed eggplant and chili peppers, and the duck, which has a sweet-and-spicy coconut sauce and what looks like a pair of piroulines but is actually duck-and-litchi rolls. The only two real desserts, fruit and sorbet, are perfectly refreshing; this is no time for chocolate cake. (Open daily for dinner only; entrées $12-$25.)</p>

The co-owner and head baker, Judith Norell, started out baking at home, but she later worked for Gerard Mulot in France and Le Pain Quotidien here in New York. Her pastry chef, Liliane Tambasco, was also in Paris, at Fauchon. On any given day, through the window of the sunlit corner storefront, you can watch Norell and her bakers turning flour into the bumpy loaves and buns and pretty tarts and cakes that line the racks like folk art. Which is to say that the food is often rustic but not always cheap (an apple tartlet is $4). And if you have your heart set on an apricot-and-hazelnut Parisienne (a favorite, with such nice chunks of fruit that it needs neither butter nor jam) it’s best to call ahead or get there early.</p><p data-wc="160" word_count="160">Norell bakes everything from daily bread—baguettes, ciabatta, and challah—to more creative loaves, like the fig-and-black-pepper dome, the orange-chocolate bread, or the <em>pain au lait aux raisins</em>. A lot of the cakes and pastries sound plain, but plenty of them are complex and wonderful, such as the sage-walnut roll, or that apple tartlet, which tastes more like apple than some apples do. (Like most of the sweets, it’s flavored less with sugar than with vanilla, or cinnamon, or butter, or all three.) For all the variety, only two kinds of quiche are available, but the feta, tomato, and onion, which has a rich, cream-style custard, is the only kind you need. In the summer, seating is available outdoors, where a pricier café menu is served, including fine sandwiches (the goat cheese cucumber-and-olive tapenade on olive-rosemary sourdough is best) and, of course, big bowls of café au lait.

It’s the sort of setting that calls for a crowd scene, but six months after opening the crowds haven’t arrived. You can even overhear monologues from distant tables, thanks to an unsettling acoustic trick common to vaulted ceilings. The staff fills in gaps in the echoing conversation, stopping by frequently to ask, “Has everything been prepared to your liking?”</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">The atmosphere of prom-night anxiety lets up at lunch, when patrons are more likely to ignore the dress code. The menu, too, goes in shirtsleeves, dropping its one ostentatious item (Kobe beef from Seattle, $110 for ten ounces) and moving from grandiloquence (Panache of Three Salads) to reportage (Maine Lobster with Sweet Peas, Fava Beans, Haricots Verts, Blood Orange, and Port Wine Sauce). The waiters, the best-dressed men in the room, retreat to their natural state of distant condescension, leaving customers free to enjoy the food.</p><p data-wc="160" word_count="160">It’s too bad that the restaurant has some kinks to work out, because sixteen years after opening the original Bouley, David Bouley, the chef, can still whip up elaborately balanced marvels. His summertime amuse-bouche—a teaspoon of crabmeat hidden under a sort of light gazpacho aspic, covered by a dollop of avocado—packs in more distinct flavors than you’ll find in most tasting menus. One improbably swashbuckling appetizer he calls Return to Chiang Mai (after the resort town in northern Thailand) includes layers of mango, lobster, papaya, and truffled artichoke in a wrapping of Serrano ham. This sort of culinary thrill-seeking was epidemic back in the nineties; the intent was sensual alertness, but too often the result was indigestion. Nonetheless, Bouley is subtler than his ingredients would lead you to believe. With any luck, the schizophrenic service will keep enough people away so that anyone can get a reservation.

Despite the inconvenience, the Delegates’ Dining Room, where buffet lunches are served on weekdays, is open to the public; all you need is a reservation and a photo I.D. Once you’re in, a dour elevator attendant pilots you up to the dining room, otherwise known as Room 414. It may sound like a place where detainees get questioned, perhaps even roughly, but it is a civilized space: carpeted, soundproofed, and flooded with daylight. The commanding view of Turtle Bay inspires the usual talk of squandered waterfront acreage and unpaid parking tickets.</p><p data-wc="94" word_count="94">Who dines in Room 414? “An assortment of hangers-on and bureaucrats,” said an old U.N. hand, whose time abroad had left him bitter. He pointed to an African man in a dark business suit. “I was with that guy in Somalia and Liberia.” Chances are that in a hundred visits to Burger Heaven you would not overhear the words “Suez Canal” or “There’s Radovic,” but such is the table talk here. The dress code calls for a jacket or native costume; on a good day, the place recalls the cantina in “Star Wars.”</p><p data-wc="163" word_count="163">The chef occasionally throws two-week festivals (in October the focus will be on the cuisines of Poland and Peru), but the buffet’s the thing; the food is good, and it gives you the chance to make multiple trips through international table space. The offerings change daily, and while one dish or another might offend certain delegates no one is likely to go hungry. At the first table there might be cucumber salad, tabbouleh, fish pâté, pork pâté, white-bean soup. At the second: braised short ribs, dill salmon with lemon beurre blanc, chicken tikka. At the third: pork loin with a mandarin-orange sauce, and a pot of veal blanquette. And last, a dessert layout for the diplomatically immune: blueberry crumb cake, apple tart, cheeses, chocolates. Grab one of the big plates and pile it high. And don’t forget to fill your pockets with packets of sugar. (“United Nations Sugar,” they read, in Blue Helmet blue.) (Open weekdays for lunch.

The owner, Orhan Yegen, a veteran of various Mediterranean restaurants in Manhattan, might arrive at your table to announce that it would be a shame to bypass “tonight’s very good, very fresh” anchovies, dressed in olive oil and vinegar, or the yogurt-rice-and-mint soup, but after that it’s up to you.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">Freshness is the hallmark of the tidbits at Beyoglu (pronounced BAY-oh-loo), all of which goes well with peasant bread and modestly priced wine: beautifully blended hummus and tarama, tabbouleh, kibbeh (ground raw filet mignon, thickened with cracked wheat and spiked with hot red peppers), and cumin-spiced salami. Patlican salatasi—mashed eggplant salad—adds a nice touch of smokiness, and the superb Greek salad includes sweet stuffed grape leaves and bits of artichoke. The chef could do more with the bland slabs of smoked mackerel, but the poached calf’s brains, with lemon and olive oil, are delicious.</p><p data-wc="130" word_count="130">Most diners will be content to dawdle over the small dishes, the way the Turks do, but for customers who must have a main course a terrific gyro of vertically cooked, razor-thin slices of lamb and beef, served with rice pilaf, eggplant purée, and a garlic-yogurt sauce, is available. For dessert, there’s a richly nutty almond pudding, and if you still want to get deeper into meze, just wave to Mr. Yegen, and he’s apt to bring out, as he did the other night, two samplings of “special” ingredients. One is an almost shockingly pungent paste of fresh tomatoes; the other is a tongue-piercing purée of hot red peppers. “They both go a long way,” he said. (Open daily for dinner.

The only choice available is a cheese-steak sandwich. It comes two ways: to stay (sliced in half through wax-paper wrapper and set down on a small plastic plate, with a moist towelette and two chocolate mints) or to go (in a paper bag with all the aforementioned except the plate and the slicing). There’s also canned soda and bottled water, but if you want coffee go across the street.</p><p data-wc="64" word_count="64">Here’s what you get: a kaiser roll (not an Italian-sub roll, as in the authentic Philly version) with a slice of white American cheese on each side; about half an inch of thinly sliced, flavorful rib eye; another half inch of marinated then caramelized onions that still have some crunch; and a generous squirt of a spiky red-pepper sauce (again, not exactly authentic).</p><p data-wc="53" word_count="53">    It’s a pretty simple setup, but first-timers who wander in—lured by a small chalkboard that reads “The Best ‘Damn’ Cheese Steak Period”—seem initially confused. “How does this work?” the spokesman for a trio of N.Y.U. types asked. “We have cheese steaks,” the chef and owner, Gary Thompson, replied.</p><p data-wc="78" word_count="78">    Defenders of the original “cheesesteak” in Philadelphia might disagree. Their local papers have run dismissive articles since BB opened to huge popularity in March, including one titled “Bite This, New York.” Not that New Yorkers cared. Thompson sells four or five hundred sandwiches a day, and a couple of months ago he had to temporarily lock the front door of his five-table dining room in order to take care of the eleven hundred phone orders he’d received.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">    ”There’s one guy who comes in every single day,” Thompson says. “We’re a little worried about him.” One thing he and his girlfriend, Danielle Dimston, who helps run the place, don’t seem worried about is the idea that there’s only one way to make a cheese steak—although they’re not crazy about customizing their own formula. “You can get a special order, but it will take fifteen minutes,” Dimston says. “When people ask for no onions, we usually tell them just to scrape them off.” (Open daily from 10:30 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span> to midnight.

Later, his co-chef and partner, Sharon Pachter, stops by to recommend a wine from the all-over-the-map list (Tasmania?), and toward the end of the night, as the small room of thirteen tables empties, she sits down to talk neighborhood apartments.</p><p data-wc="123" word_count="123">The couple’s mi-casa-tu-casa routine is so over the top that at times it can distract you from the food, which is quite a trick, because Grocery excels at big concentrated flavors and country-house meats: pasta with “house-made” sausage, roasted tomato, and kale; marinated skirt steak with sautéed escarole; slow-rendered duck in caramelized wine sauce with spoonbread. The appetizers—those chicken livers, the white-wine risotto and shrimp with English peas and orange—hold nothing back; even the plain salad (“teen-age greens,” according to the menu) gives you a little attitude. The power-hitter philosophy can lead to the occasional strikeout—one trout entrée came out spongy and sodden—but it doesn’t matter. Kiely has the best slugging percentage on Smith Street.</p><p data-wc="126" word_count="126">The décor at Grocery heads in the opposite direction: simple paper-topped tables in a slate-gray room up front, café tables under the fig tree and lush ivy-draped walls out back, in a shotgun arrangement with the kitchen in the middle—where Kiely and Pachter’s Lucy-and-Ricky slapstick takes place in plain view. Diners used to “Kitchen Confidential”-style culinary egos may take it for an act. If it is, it grows on you. Reservations at the small place can be a problem. “We really can’t give you your corner table that night,” Pachter said on a recent call. She had to hold it for a couple who got engaged there. “They come every week.” (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner only. Entrées $17-$21.)</p>

To start things off, the waiter arrives at your table with little cups holding decapitated brown eggshells that contain the warm, barely poached yolk of a quail’s egg, lukewarm mushroom soup, and a cool purée of chives, each ingredient layered as if to defy gravity. You can investigate this with a demitasse spoon or toss the whole thing back like schnapps. Either way, the earthy combination of textures, temperatures, flavors, and colors adds up to what must be the most sensuous starter in town.</p><p data-wc="226" word_count="226">The long room’s pale-green banquettes and sycamore panelling match the kitchen’s winning strategy of applying the principles of modern French haute cuisine to regional produce from America and from the chef’s native Alsace—although some of the ingredients would test a botanist’s knowledge. Appetizers include a tangy tartare of diver scallops and bluefin tuna with caviar, and a terrine of rabbit, complemented by a green coulis made with Riesling and the highly aromatic herb hyssop. (The animal’s tiny, tasty innards make for a picturesque garnish.) Among the main courses, fish takes precedence, notably a poached halibut in a sea-bean sauce and a saffron broth; a whole steamed sea bass in a mustard-sharpened pink-grapefruit juice, accompanied by celery cannelloni; and lobster, which arrives roasted in the company of artichokes, rhubarb, and caramelized baby fennel. The desserts would seem to be Eloise’s idea of the perfect birthday-party fare: peanut-butter ice cream with Rice Krispies, chocolate leaves, and condensed-milk cappuccino; a chocolate fondant with cinnamon frozen milk and chocolate puffed wheat; and apple crumble with a blueberry-and-goat’s-milk sorbet. The wine list is copious but well chosen, and the service—from the doorman’s effusive “Good evening!” to the waiter’s discourse on the deft alchemy of each dish—is excellent. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $28-$40; prix fixe $68.)</p>

The chef and owner, Tom Colicchio, intended Craft as solace from the kind of “culinary fatigue” he knew diners had been suffering. But instead, Craft ended up seeming to some like the pulpit of a pious food purist.</p><p data-wc="189" word_count="189">Back then, there was not a menu per se; waiters brought a large sheet of paper listing categories of exquisitely high-quality greenmarket and artisanal ingredients (meat, fish and shellfish, vegetables, mushrooms, grains and beans, etc.) and vague descriptions of how they'd be prepared (braised, roasted, sautéed), but no course divisions. From there, building a meal was up to you—even if you had no idea about food pairing or even whether a rabbit ballottine was dinner or dessert. However things turned out, you were apparently getting food as God intended it. Still, big tables of Wall Streeters and well-heeled couples accustomed to having a chef do their cooking stared uncomfortably at the document with crinkled brows, wondering what a Jerusalem artichoke might be good for. When the food came, laid out on massive craftsman's tables, each nearly naked chunk of lobster or seared beef and every noble heap of sugar snap peas or soft polenta was arranged in a pretty copper pot or ceramic dish—and it was ridiculously delicious. But asceticism has never been so expensive. (Seven dollars for a plate of sautéed spinach?)</p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">The menu has taken on more structure since then, and the atmosphere, curiously, has loosened up. While the kitchen now decides whether your hen-of-the-woods mushrooms should be your starter or your side (what madman would eat them as an appetizer?), the unlisted embellishments added to each item (for example, fleur de sel, olive oil, and lemon zest on the raw fluke, served on a tangle of sour sorrel) are a nice surprise. If things are still too overwhelming for you, though, there's always the instructive $85 tasting menu, which recently included roasted halibut with saffron risotto, black sea bass with roasted asparagus and fingerlings, braised beef short ribs with roasted carrots and potato purée, followed by balsamic strawberries and vanilla ice cream. Write that down. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for dinner only. Main courses $22-$36.)</p>

Who knows? This one landed a step below street level midway down a quiet Chelsea block only because Arlene Weston, who often walked by on her way home, saw a shady-looking deli go out of business. “I don’t know what they were selling out of there,” she says. “But it wasn’t deli meat.”</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">Cue the Maroons video montage: Arlene’s grandmother hands over her life savings to her granddaughter; the dark old Sixteenth Street property gets sunny French windows; an old classmate (Eugene McCall, Hackensack High, class of 1978) shows up, back from New Orleans to work as the chef; and family photos go up, including a big blowup right over the bar of grandmother Sarah Brooks-Weston wearing a serious expression and a long dress and standing on Fifth Avenue, just months after arriving from Jamaica, in 1946.</p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">The food, too, is serious and authentic, and you’d better be seriously hungry if you’re going to eat your share. Weston and McCall have made an effort to lighten up family recipes (they switched from lard to butter here and there), but they have not messed around where they shouldn’t. The baby-back ribs come in a stack—sweet, hot, charred, and far from lean. The yucca puffs come in a cannonball arrangement on a pool of ginger and molasses: they taste like doughnuts that got a life. Even the mango-shrimp salad has an edge: the shrimps are spicy enough to make you reach repeatedly for your beer.</p><p data-wc="85" word_count="85">And that’s just the appetizers. After that, it’s so much curried goat (a thick stew with Spaldeen-size meat chunks) and fried chicken (with a bear paw of mac and cheese) that you have enough left over for the next day’s lunch. Could this be healthy? The best person to ask would be Grandmother Brooks, who, at eighty-five, is a regular and likes to order the stewed oxtail.

Washington Park’s menu changes daily, but with Waxman putting his personal imprimatur on every dish it has already reached the consistency of a restaurant that’s been around for years.</p><p data-wc="263" word_count="263">Not that there aren’t a few kinks to be addressed. Despite its Jamesian location north of Washington Square, the multilevelled dining area, which surrounds a clangorous bar, has the acoustics of a soup kitchen. (When asked to send someone over with advice about the beautifully chosen wine list, the hostess thought a recent diner wanted to talk about Somalia.) In the chef’s desire to edit everything down to essentials, a pairing of breaded “veal Milan” with a bed of undressed baby arugula conjured up nothing more poetic than a cow’s day of munching. But, on the whole, the Waxman approach shows a master’s sense of what can be done by restricting the harmony among animals and vegetables to just three or four parts. An earthy dish of breaded sweetbreads and morels was lightened by a Malmsey sauce. Shrimp with tangy spring garlic nested in angel-hair pasta. Soft-shell crabs topped a field of mizuna surrounded by red mustard. When it comes to color, Waxman seems to have Redon in mind, especially in a salad of Valencia oranges, red and white beets, and amaranth, which looked almost too good to eat. For foodies with long memories, the Waxman signature dishes are still here: a starter of red-pepper pancakes, topped with smoked salmon, caviar, and crème fraîche, that gives new meaning to “mouth-filling,” and a grilled organic chicken with French fries that remains a New American object lesson in how to achieve both moistness and crispness without a hint of grease. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner. Entrées $24-$32.)</p>

By opening this upscale barbecue joint, off Park Avenue South, Danny Meyer, the man behind Union Square Café, is just asking for trouble.</p><p data-wc="96" word_count="96">Blue Smoke certainly smells right, despite an elaborate ventilation system and a neighbor-friendly smokestack fifteen stories up. A half-cord of split applewood stands outside the kitchen doors, ready for the smoker. Nonetheless, the place has the feel of a chain restaurant in a converted warehouse on the outskirts of Toronto. Maybe it’s the waitstaff’s Blue Smoke T-shirts, made by Timberland and offered for sale alongside bottles of the house barbecue sauce, or the restaurant’s proximity to the global headquarters of Credit Suisse First Boston, which appears to be supplying much of the clientele.</p><p data-wc="157" word_count="157">Meyer seems to want to make barbecue pristine; instead he’s made it prissy. You get dishrags for napkins, but nothing sloppy enough to justify putting them to use. The ribs are smoked for seven hours. Whether that’s too much or too little, they’re as dry and drab as ham (not that there’s anything wrong with ham). The hot links and pickles come neatly sliced. The brisket is parched, the pulled pork moist but underpulled. “Oh, you have to try the macaroni and cheese,” a waitress said, and it turned out to be just a cut above Kraft (not that there’s anything wrong with that, either). Coleslaw, pit beans, creamed spinach, collard greens: they are what they are. The foie gras with jalapeño marmalade made momentary sense only because Prince’s “Raspberry Beret” happened to be playing on the jukebox, but it revealed itself to be fey once the Meters kicked in.</p><p data-wc="73" word_count="73">It doesn’t seem right to complain about a place where you can gorge on plates of meat and pints of beer, start off with fry bread and finish with banana-cream pie. But truth is, while bad barbecue can be fine in the way that even the worst hot dogs or milkshakes usually are, mediocre barbecue that is expensive and pretentious is no good at all.

For lovers of those larger-than-life pachyderms known as opera singers, the bordello-red walls are lined with faded photographs of legendary and not so legendary divas and their leading men—relics of the restaurant’s former identity as Asti, a longtime tourist destination that featured singing waiters who knew the words to “La donna è mobile.” For nostalgists of the lost art of slow undressing in a spotlight, there are glossies of statuesque ecdysiasts who once top-lined the burlesque circuit with names like Blaze, Dawn, and Gypsy Rose. And for people whose idea of sensual bliss peaks at the prospect of sinking their teeth into slabs of prime beef, there is an array of classic cuts, from strip and chop to flank and filet.</p><p data-wc="125" word_count="125">The background music can get aggressively loud, and the waiters sometimes seem to prefer talking to each other rather than to the customers. But there is an attentively steady hand in the kitchen, which offers a couple of surprises as well as some thoughtful alternatives for the non-carnivores. The most interesting appetizer is a short-rib “flan” that delivers the braised meat in a wrap of endive, with roasted garlic, chanterelles, and a port sauce. Entrées include a sesame-crusted yellowfin tuna in a green peppercorn sauce, and fresh linguine tossed with duck confit, roasted corn, and thyme. Among the desserts, the most memorable is a spectacularly messy profiterole, with two kinds of chocolate ice cream, a lava flow of hot-fudge sauce, and a raspberry coulis.</p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">When it comes to the steak, Strip House can more than hold its own against the competition. The strips and their more marbled cousins arrive perfectly charred, crusted, and seasoned, and, for a little glamour, the waiter will bring boats of Stilton, Bordelaise, and béarnaise sauces. As for the sides, this steak house may be in a class by itself. Truffles take creamed spinach into a whole new comfort zone. And a tower of creamy potatoes comes encased in a golden crust that could only have been achieved by deep-frying the whole thing in goose fat.

On a recent Friday night, subdued groups of multi-culti kids in rock T-shirts and creatively gelled hair were parked beneath slowly spinning ceiling fans. A pair of primly fashionable young Brits made pronouncements about what is and is not “coo-el” about New York (Smith Street, in Brooklyn, is; the men, with their confusing mating rituals, are not) while many of the Tribeca neighborhood’s artistic types, complete with their precocious, late-life kids, downed the ultrafresh concoctions that practically fly out of the kitchen, which is run by a trio of talented Vietnamese women.</p><p data-wc="230" word_count="230">The most interesting starter is the <em>ca bam</em>, chopped seasoned monkfish, seared and served alongside a rice cracker; it looks like a plate of dog kibble and a big brown matzo but is actually pretty addictive. The best is <em>ca tim nuong</em>, Asian eggplant, sliced and then grilled just to the point of sweetness and barely seasoned with lime and ginger—a good example of Nam’s success through simplicity. There’s a fine salad of watercress, tomato, charred onion slices, and rare cubes of tender steak that taste just like the wine-soaked beef tips every respectable American restaurant once served. The <em>bun ch</em>a, a barbecued-pork-and-noodle dish, however, is dry and wan; the <em>ga nuong</em>, advertised as roasted chicken with lime dipping sauce, is a lovely half bird hacked into moist slices with crunchy, garlicky skin—but the sauce turns out to be just more of the sweet-and-sour <em>nuoc cham</em>, which is not much to complain about but disappointing if your palate was anticipating something truly limey. Both the crispy red snapper and the steamed sea bass are light but satisfying, and the kitchen makes perfect jasmine and sticky rice to go with it all. Skip dessert and substitute a Vietnamese coffee, a strong brew that drips into a glass with two fingers of sweetened condensed milk. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for dinner only. Entrées $8-$16.)</p>

The wines all come from women vintners, the pretty décor is minimalist Martha Stewart, and the glass oil lamps on the tables look a bit like silicone breast implants. In the wrong hands this kind of thing could get annoying—it’s so San Francisco. But Annisa’s co-owners, Jennifer Scism and the chef Anita Lo, make it work, with clever cuisine and low-key charm.</p><p data-wc="110" word_count="110">The elevated dining area is small but manages to seem spacious: it has spare, cream-colored walls, simple arrangements of white tuberoses and Casablanca lilies, recessed lighting, and just enough room between tables for the waiters to give diners useful advice without being overheard. Upon delivering one appetizer, a plate of soup dumplings topped with wedges of foie gras (which are outstanding), the waiter strongly urged that they be eaten with a Chinese soupspoon, because the dumplings were full of broth. “No obligation,” he said, “but trust me.” He also reported that Martha Stewart herself comes in a lot, and always orders the miso-marinated sable and tofu in a bonito broth.</p><p data-wc="170" word_count="170">Not everything on the menu is so precious. After a while the waiter came in from the kitchen and announced that although there was one remaining piece of Arctic char the chef had deemed it unworthy. A quick second look at the menu resulted in a substitute order of braised pork belly with clams and “giant white beans,” a brave combination, so odd it had to be good. As it turned out, it was chewy, wintry, and interesting, but not exactly ideal, and the pork orderer spent the rest of the evening raiding his friends’ plates—in a manly way, of course. The other main courses were excellent: a buttery cut of cod; a sautéed skate filet, fanned out around a big marrow-filled veal bone; and a roasted chicken, stuffed with chanterelles and pig’s feet, that didn’t taste like chicken. The desserts are also great, the apple tart in particular, and the chick wine is damn fine. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for dinner only. Entrées $22-$29.)</p>

In the well-patrolled foyer of the auction house, a sign bearing the restaurant’s name points down a flight of stairs, which leads into a spacious room that looks like the perfect setting for a shipboard romance circa 1951: undulating banquettes, flying-saucer chandeliers, discreetly illuminated art, and enough space between the tables to ensure that no one will overhear your conversation about how much you’re planning to spend on that Matisse.</p><p data-wc="155" word_count="155">Bid’s servers, crisply outfitted in beige vests, announce the option of a four-, five-, or seven-course tasting menu of your own devising. The talented young chef, an alumnus of Gramercy Tavern named Matt Seeber, must have really put away the condiments as a kid. His terrific sautéed quail is accompanied by Savoy cabbage, yellowfoot chanterelles, and a turnip-and-apple cider; the hot and cold foie gras is served with apple chutney, cider vinegar, cardamom, and vanilla bean. Plain New England cod gets a weekend at the Ritz with brandade, zucchini confit, niçoise olives, almonds, and preserved lemon; “chowder” was never less chowdery, coming as it does with braised lobster, celery root, fennel, bluefoot mushrooms, and bacon. The kitchen presents sirloin and short rib of beef in tandem, joined by farro, roasted beets, tripe, and a sprinkling of black-truffle oil. A well-appointed squab also gets the double treatment—crisp-roasted breast next to slow-braised leg.</p><p data-wc="75" word_count="75">Desserts, by the pastry chef Chika Tillman, are offered on two levels—elevated homey combinations without alcohol, such as the apple tart tatin with Granny Smith granita and vanilla ice cream, and elevated homey combinations with alcohol, such as the same dish spiked with a twenty-six-year-old Calvados. When it’s all over, landing the Matisse may not seem so important after all. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, Saturdays for dinner only. Entrées $25-$32.)</p>

Now they’ve turned the culinary volume up a few notches and moved to Tribeca.</p><p data-wc="99" word_count="99">If you find a seat at the packed bar, the bartender will offer you a taste of Bradley’s bootleg limoncello, which is tart, sweet, and so strong it makes the top of your head sting. When Bradley passes by on one of his frequent dining-room tours, he’ll tell you the recipe. Abrams will probably be there, too, between motorcycle trips to the Red Cat, helmet in hand, chatting up the customers and downing a batch of the rich chocolate beignets (he claims to eat four orders a day, yet he’s as thin as a piano leg).</p><p data-wc="162" word_count="162">The new place is airier and more austere than its cozy cousin, but it gets plenty of color from its crowd: a couple of auburn minks and a turquoise cloche in one corner, flashes of red lipstick at the bar, a head of green hair trying to score a table at the reservation stand. The flavors on the small, New American menu are as vivid as the clientele yet almost irreverently mellow. To start, the cavatelli with veal cheeks, tomato, and Pecorino is good, and so are yellowfin tuna atop cucumber and yellow-tomato gazpacho and the sweet fried clams with lemon-coriander aioli. Among the fish entrées, the day-boat cod, which comes with “melted” leeks and shiitakes in porcini broth, is especially satisfying, but this is a terrific place to order a shell steak, too; Bradley’s is flavored with pancetta and balsamic vinegar. The side of pumpkin risotto with apricots and mascarpone is almost like a dessert and strictly for sharing.</p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">Like the rest of the staff, the sommelier is as enthusiastic as he is blasé and will quickly calculate the distance between the Italian regions of two bottles on the international list—although he’ll laugh at the question before adding, “I’m a fast driver.” For dessert, the beignets are excellent; the buttermilk panna cotta with citrus fruit is less lethal.

Nearly four hundred people can disappear into its two levels, which are done in “cocoon” upstairs (that’s what they’re calling brown) and downstairs in “white” (that’s what they’re calling white). An eighty-foot terrazzo staircase connecting the two floors proves irresistible to anybody in black—about half the clientele and all the staff—and the subdued parade of silhouettes going up and down is as mesmerizing as anything on the flashing JumboTron outside. That’s at lunch—the parade grows feistier around cocktail hour, when patrons begin to make the treacherous climb from the street-level bar to the rest rooms upstairs.</p><p data-wc="73" word_count="73">Probably because the place is so new (it’s in the W Hotel), the attentiveness level of the wait gang can be unnervingly high, as if you’d wandered into a private bank by mistake. Once, after a seating mixup, a manager asked for business cards, so as to assure prime tables for all future reservations. Another day, a diner idly wished for a second plate of bread, and seconds later it appeared.</p><p data-wc="138" word_count="138">Paul Sale (who started as a chef in the British Merchant Navy, and moved on to Le Bernardin) serves fresh cuts of fish matched with solid flavors. The Maine-lobster salad is a mix of claw flesh and summery cucumber and citrus. The “big eye” tuna shows up on a nest of peppery radish sprouts. The Chilean sea bass comes with leeks and fennel, and the wild salmon comes with seared sprigs of thyme—more riverbank, less saucepot. Even the arch touches, such as the occasional black-pepper gnocchi, the painterly “parsley pesto drizzle,” are underplayed, without the food-channel theatrics. This leaves room for the more naturally baroque portions of the meal: the tasting of crème brûlées, the trinity of chocolates in shades of rich, dark cocoon.

She replied, “Because it covers up a multitude of sins.” Too often, so does Indian cooking, whose shortcomings—wan vegetables, stringy meat—can be easily disguised by a decent curry, a pot of rice, and a lump of poori. But Walter D’Rozario, the executive chef at Utsav, a two-year-old Indian restaurant in midtown, has nothing to hide. D’Rozario, from Calcutta, learned to cook in Bombay and considers himself a Bombaywallah. Nonetheless, his menu is a regular subcontinental congress, with delegates from Kashmir, Punjab, Goa, Hyderabad, Lucknow, and elsewhere. In his hands, Indian cuisine is as diverse as the subcontinent itself.</p><p data-wc="111" word_count="111">Utsav’s carpeted foyer, with its vine-draped fountain and bad Muzak, is more Miami Marriott than Maharashtra. Still, the window-lined dining room, on the second floor, is broad and comfortable, suffused with peach-colored light from alabaster lamps. A bread boy in a paper hat drifts from table to table with a basket of naan. Another guy comes by with the chutneys; the tomato chutney, sweet and hot, is good enough to eat with a spoon. In the middle of the day, Utsav bustles with devotees of its inexpensive lunch buffet, a changing gauntlet of standards—palak corn, vindaloo, carrot pudding—that leaves postprandial office workers dazed in the Sixth Avenue glare.</p><p data-wc="131" word_count="131">The appetizers (or “savoury awakenings,” in Utsav menuspeak) are slight and clean: stone-seared pads of lamb (patthar ka gosht), Bengali fritters, and so on. The bright-green spinach-and-pea soup is called Baisakhi, after the spring harvest festival, and amid all the lamb and lentils, it blossoms like a lily. But most of the menu is devoted to meat. The nalli rogan josh—braised lamb shanks in a thin, well-seasoned sauce—are a Kashmiri specialty, known as the “prince of curries,” and the spicy peppered strips of tenderloin hail from Kerala, along the southwestern coast. There is also a wonderful coconut-flavored west-coast-fisherman’s curry from Konkan. The naan man comes around again. You sop up your sauces. You contemplate “sweet fantasy.” (That means dessert.)

Appetizers jump from “petite” empanadas made with merguez and manchego to calamari cracklings with wasabi aioli, mizuna, and something called “ponzu dip.” “Light plates” include ahi wonton tacos with green-papaya slaw and something called “bumbu dunk.” Among the pastas is a Malay red vegetable curry with soba noodles and tofu crisps. Entrées include a braise of veal and endive in preserved-lemon sauce, and more crisps (of lemon sole), accompanied by toasted mango and coconut rice topped with curry sauce.</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">Punch offers a variety of casual fare, the most impressive of which is a knuckle sandwich, constructed on pumpernickel with pork, smoked trotter bits, Muenster cheese, and caramelized sauerkraut. Fortunately, the setting—walls painted in a harlequinish pattern, torch lamps with Venetian shades—is cheerfully relaxed, and the chef’s wanderlust is matched by a light and zestful hand. Particularly successful are an Arctic-crab spring roll with hoi-an herbs; mussels steeped with linguiça and tomatoes and sharpened with smoked paprika; a pasta casserole with potatoes, tomatoes, toasted haricots, sheep’s-milk cheese, and Tuscan greens; and a chicken breast with sorrel and a mash of fingerling potatoes which is so good and simple that one feels like Dorothy waking up in Kansas after her trip to Oz.

In a former dress shop—whose display windows now hold high-style seating complete with snake plants and Lucite chairs—aKa serves the kind of snacks you’d expect to discover at a street cart (and features Latin and Jewish ingredients from the neighborhood’s old days), but with an arty twist.</p><p data-wc="252" word_count="252">Although it’s been more than two years since 71 launched the culinary gentrification of this corner of the city, it still must be startling for the neighborhood’s old-timers to witness the steady flow of sharply dressed uptowners who stop here for a bite before beginning their downtown bar crawls. It’s a pit-stop kind of place. Each dish makes one succinct point, and while that strategy works at 71, here the menu is like a list of gastronomic one-liners that don’t quite add up to a full meal. Also, some of the dishes seem a little nuts. Matzo bread is served with a decidedly unkosher, bacon-heavy oyster soup. A Cuban-style pressed steak-and-pickle sandwich comes on half a bialy. The craziest stunt may be the lamb-tongue sandwich with almond butter and red-currant jelly. Luckily, they all taste good. And a recently added section of the menu, “bigger hot plates” (skate cakes, braised pork loin and shoulder) tries to address the portion problem. The most tapas-like item, a dish of hard-boiled egg with chorizo and tomato paste, is a surprising pleasure because it’s so simple. The empanadas are tamper-proof despite their rambunctious-sounding chutneys and relishes: braised pork with pickled collards is especially satisfying. There’s a brief but well-picked wine list with enough available by the glass to suit the grazing strategy of eating that the place invites. For dessert there are more empanadas (chocolate ones) and dulce-de-leche pudding. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, Saturdays for dinner only. Entrées $6-$12.)</p>

Last June, when he opened his sleek new bistro next to the Algonquin hotel, he went public with it.</p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">For twenty-nine dollars, the DB Burger comes with a silver julep cup of frites and a surprise hidden in the ground sirloin: a complex hash of black truffle and sautéed foie gras where the rare center should be. It’s an adult take on a back-yard classic—rich, well travelled, charred in the right places, and a little jaded. Boulud calls it “the most successful dish I ever created.”</p><p data-wc="177" word_count="177">Although no other item gets quite so theatrical, the rest of the menu sticks to this brand of renovation, offering haute-cuisine versions of home-cooking favorites. In most cases, the slight tweaks—the lobster ravioli come wrapped in sage pasta, the skate grandmère arrives on a homey artichoke mirepoix—smack more of Proust than of Barnum, and sometimes the subtle effects get lost in the midtown lunch-hour clamor. But at dinner, the winter specials (listed under “slow-cooked dishes of the day”) offer big sis-boom-bah flavor; if you’ve ever wanted to try pigs’ feet, this is your chance. Deboned, poached in white wine, stuffed back in the skin like a sausage, and served sliced on a bed of lentils cooked in vermouth, they’re the sort of once-in-a-lifetime dish which makes you turn to your neighbor and proselytize. But the three women at the next table demurred. “We’re from Alabama,” one said. “We know what pigs get into with their feet.” (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner, Sundays for dinner only.

But the oxtail consommé is kind of depressing, all tradition and purity. The savory spaetzle, flavored with Quark—a fresh curd cheese that comes across like sour cream—are fortified by braised rabbit and wild mushrooms.

The second most important Viennese dish for traditionalists is Tafelspitz, but no matter how nicely beef is boiled, the eating becomes a chore about halfway through, even though the side of creamed spinach helps matters. The menu’s Hungarian ringer, beef goulash, is surprisingly light and balanced, with none of the usual over-paprikaed-leftover taste. Pastries are sacred in Vienna, and there’s a great entrée option here: cod strudel with melted tomatoes, tarragon, and Riesling sauce.</p><p data-wc="80" word_count="80">More traditional pastries turn up at dessert: apple strudel, Salzburger Nockerl, and crêpelike Palatschinken, with oranges. The standout is the poached dumplings filled with more Quark and coated in sautéed bread crumbs and ground nuts. The wine list offers the opportunity for an easygoing, inexpensive education in Austrian wines, from Gruener Veltliners to Blaufraenkisches, among them a terrific spicy red that is fun to say aloud—Heinrich’s Pannobile Rot.

Like many European establishments favored by opera-, ballet-, and concertgoers, Castellano—which attracts many of its patrons from City Center, across the street, and Carnegie Hall, a few blocks away—is devoted to serious eating without fuss. Waiters with smoke-weathered faces and droopy black ties recite specialties of the day as though remarking on the weather. A dessert trolley is wheeled up on the off chance that someone is feeling nostalgic for blueberries and cream. The hand in the kitchen is so practiced that the most familiar dishes seem freshly satisfying. Among the best choices on a menu that ranges knowingly across the northern regions of Italy are a petal-like beef carpaccio with a mustard-mayonnaise sauce from Harry’s Bar; a feather-light spinach and egg-drop soup <em>alla romana</em>; homemade black tagliatelle with cuttlefish; swordfish sautéed in a soft tangle of leeks; and crusty, charred slices of sirloin, accompanied by a dipping sauce of anchovy and herbs. For many regulars, the <em>specialità della casa</em> is the humblest one—a side order of spinach sauteéd in garlic and oil to such silky perfection that one can imagine Brassaï’s demimondaine saying, “You see? <em>This</em> is how it’s done.” (Open daily for dinner, weekdays for lunch and dinner.

The wait looks long, but it isn’t. They turn you over fast—Viand is the perfect spot for a reluctant lunch. “No time for blah-blah-blah,” George Kontoziannis, the owner, says with pride.</p><p data-wc="87" word_count="87">At Viand the turkey is the thing, and not just during the holidays. Kontoziannis will not say how many turkeys he and his crew cook each day (“You don’t want to brag”), but he’ll allow that the number is somewhere around ten. Before roasting, the turkeys are boiled for two hours in giant vats, which, with drumsticks and rump sticking out, call to mind a kitchen in a “Tom and Jerry” cartoon. The steam from the process leaves the plate-glass window up front permanently fogged.</p><p data-wc="177" word_count="177">Viand may be a greasy spoon, but its turkey sandwich is neat and clean—fresh meat and iceberg lettuce on rye, mayo or Russian dressing on the side—leaving both the pleasures and limitations of the bird more or less uncamouflaged. It comes in other guises, as well: turkey melt, turkey club, turkey-roast-beef combo, turkey with cranberry sauce, all-turkey chef’s salad, and, of course, turkey burger. There are also sardines—the turkey of the sea. Beyond that, really, it’s standard coffee-shop grub: Greek salad, chicken Monte Cristo, “plate of ice cream,” dollops of coleslaw, and packets of Saltines. At the right time of day (mealtime), the burgers are very good, and the B.L.T.s crisp enough to cut the roof of the mouth. And the chilled rice pudding, served in a fruit cup with a dusting of cinnamon, is worth the hassle of asking the waiter for another course and an amended check. Finish your plate. Aluminum containers to go are thirty-five cents extra. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $4-$13.)</p>

Business isn’t so hot lately, but the Russian, Mexican, and Indonesian staff remains upbeat. On a recent night one of the Afghan owners swaggered around in sweats and a backward baseball cap, chatting up women in head scarves waiting for their to-go orders.</p><p data-wc="68" word_count="68">The room is full of the expected tchotchkes (brass platters, musical instruments, ceremonial swords); what’s not expected is how good the food turns out to be. <em>Ashak</em> (scallion dumplings) in a yogurt sauce with mint, tomato, and onion, and <em>bolani kad</em>u (mashed-pumpkin turnovers) with flaky fried pastry shells are the addictive appetizers. <em>Maste o khayr</em> is a tangy yogurt-cucumber salad that goes well with, and on, everything.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">There are eighteen kebab options, grilled over hardwood charcoal in a large pit at the back of the restaurant. From the tandoori cod to the saffron-marinated filet mignon, they’re perfectly tender but a little austere; they come to life with the hot green and red chutneys. This is the place to be if you love lamb, an Afghan favorite, which comes in so many variations that the dishes are hard to distinguish from one another—one incorporates okra, another more onions. In most of the rice specialties, a giant chunk of lamb shank is hidden in the brown basmati. The “Authentic Afghan Pasta Dishes” are homemade flat noodles with yogurt sauces that include delicious combinations of garlic, mint, butter, onion, and tomato, topped with kidney beans, beef, or shrimp. There’s also a list of vegetarian entrées, heavy on eggplant and cauliflower.</p><p data-wc="44" word_count="44">No alcohol is served, and though patrons are invited to bring their own you might feel a little self-conscious when you uncork your zinfandel surrounded by the locals drinking green tea and salted yogurt shakes.

La Côte Basque, a holdover from a time when a trip to one of the city’s top French restaurants was almost as good as a trip to France, seems more inviting than ever. On a recent night, the maître d’ shepherded two patrons from the reservations booth through a crowded dining room to a banquette with the imperturbable smoothness of someone for whom doing this sort of thing is not a job but a calling. One look at the grizzled waiter told you that the acting profession, for this man, has never held the slightest allure. From <em>les potages</em> to <em>les desserts</em>, the dishes on the menu registered like warm, old friends, even to a diner with schoolboy French: <em>bisque de homard</em>, <em>assiette de charcuterie maison</em>, <em>escargots méridionaux</em>, <em>casserole de Saint Jacques au safran</em>, <em>ris de veau sauté forestier</em>, <em>tarte tatin et sorbet au Calvados</em>, <em>crème brûlée à la Cassonade</em>. On that particular night, a seafood risotto with asparagus, and several quenelles in a lobster sauce, went down like food for extremely lucky babies. A crisp roast duckling in a perfectly balanced honey-and-Grand Marnier cherry sauce, and venison medallions in a sleek red-wine sauce, cast a baronial glow. A mixed-berry tart and a chocolate cake with a truffle center and white-chocolate sorbet brought a luxurious sense of completion. “Finished?” the waiter inquired when the spoons were put down. The only response, as he cleared the dishes away, was to smile and order a very good Armagnac, for old time’s sake. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner, Sundays for dinner only.

The food was fine, but nobody seemed to notice; people just fed themselves and went home. It was tempting to dismiss the place as just another chic dispensary for hearty, well-turned-out Tuscan food.</p><p data-wc="62" word_count="62">By late October, the stark ivory-on-white space somehow seemed a lot warmer than it had been before: huge arrangements of dark-green magnolia leaves and autumn flowers brushed the ceiling at the bar and near the roaring wood oven. On each table, a votive sat on a curl of brown kraft paper decorated with sprigs of leftover hydrangea and a few crab apples.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">It's likely—considering that the chef is Margherita Aloi, late of Le Madri—that the lamb chops were no less perfectly done than they had been before, that the ravioli with Bolognese sauce had always been rich but delicate, and that the list of Italian wines had always been exceptional. But tonight, diners were actually savoring their meals. Platters arranged with fritto-misto sculptures and fragrant dishes of cavatelli in a hot-and-sweet-sausage ragù arrived at tables ahead of contrails of steam. A slightly sweet, brothy barley soup accompanied a pretty autumn salad of warm butternut squash and wild mushrooms tumbling out of a baby pumpkin. When that was gone, the waiters removed the plates and brought an olive-oil-scented, wood-roasted sea bass along with a Florentine rib eye: crunchy black on the outside, deep red in the middle, and big enough to feed the Flintstones.</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">The crowd was a force of nature, too. In one corner was a man with a laugh like a foghorn. In another was a table of twelve men who looked like a benevolent fraternity; the ringleader ordered what seemed like a taste of everything on the menu for the group. When the food came, the men raised their glasses, and a woman at the next table wondered aloud what they were celebrating. The one who had done the ordering turned around, thought about it for a minute, and said, Being alive. Then they began to eat. (Open daily for lunch and dinner. Entrées $18-$35.)</p>

But that's what Aquavit's Marcus Sammuelsson has done at Scandinavia House, where you can overhear people saying things like I quit Finnish class because it was interfering with my Icelandic while viewing an exhibition of avant-garde snowshoe art.</p><p data-wc="143" word_count="143">The cool zinc-and-spruce façade of the modernist building is echoed by a wall of horizontal slats inside, where the Nordic design is typically understated. With the smart little chairs in primary colors and food wrapped in plastic at  the counter, the place is a bit like the cafeteria at  Ikea, without the stressed-out families bickering over Ivar shelving units; the tall, good-looking, and almost entirely blond crowd is serene. Sammuelsson is known at Aquavit for his inspired  creations involving obscure North Atlantic seafood. His gift to midtown lunchtime is AQ's smorgasbord, which showcases lox, gravlax, and  four kinds of herring—pickled, tomato spiked, mustard drenched, and curried, the latter described by a Minnesotan as extreme herring. The potato-scallion soup is perfect for sopping giant slabs of bumpy Knäcke flatbread, and Icelandic mussel soup comes loaded with saffron and fragrant turnips.</p><p data-wc="101" word_count="101">Scandinavians like their sandwiches open-faced, which must be the reason for the frustrating gravlax pizza: focaccia with avocado and a broad slab of cured salmon. The flavors in each squishy bite work well together, but it's piled so high that it takes some deft maneuvering to eat. There's a selection of forgettable salads and wraps, but the Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes and lingonberries is a de-luxe version of Ikea's famous lunch special.  Lunch places only really need one outstanding dish to be great, and here it's salmon lasagna—surprisingly light, and with plenty of dill-pesto sauce.</p><p data-wc="31" word_count="31">With any luck, this trend of humble expansions by star chefs will catch on—maybe Alain Ducasse could do something with a street cart?

The welcome-to-the-family introductions go down as easily as everything else does here, thanks to the knowing amiability of the place’s owner, Frank Pellegrino, Jr., who was weaned on the good red sauce at Rao’s, his parents’ celebrity joint in East Harlem. Baldoria may be only eighteen months old, but with its roomy booths, centrally located jukebox, and wall-to-wall photographs of children, relatives, and show-biz types (the most recognizable is Raquel Welch in cave-girl attire, circa 1965) it has the air of a theatre-district classic that’s been around longer than anyone can remember.</p><p data-wc="184" word_count="184">The menu is a primer—updated and distilled—in the sort of casually regional Italian-American fare that James Beard had in mind when he quipped about “food that never lets you see the pattern on the plate.” Standouts among the antipasti include grilled octopus with broccoli rabe and cippolini onions, and a lighter-than-air fritto misto of calamari, shrimp, sardines, and zucchini. The soup of seared bread in chicken broth with a poached egg and Parmesan cheese should be saved for the first winter chill. The pastas—fusilli with sausage and cabbage in a marinara sauce, ravioli with spinach, ricotta, butter, and sage—make up in satisfying familiarity what they lack in surprise. The main courses—butterflied breaded veal chop with arugula, calf’s liver Veneziana, striped bass with artichokes, capers, and olives—are as blunt as Casca’s tongue. Desserts tend unerringly toward the soft, the sweet, and the gooey. And every time Gino returns to ask “How ya doin’?” he seems on the verge of bursting into “That’s Amore.” (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for dinner only. Entrées $18-$36.)</p>

A glass of red or a glass of white? That's about as overwhelming as it gets at this corner café, whose small, uncomplicated menu makes it seem like a throwback to simpler times. So do the sweetly innocuous décor (a couple of corn plants, shimmery copper-colored curtains, walls in shades of pale green and gold, an overly bright, impastoed oil painting) and the diners, who tend to greet one another like neighbors in a small town.</p><p data-wc="152" word_count="152">You get the feeling when the food arrives that rather than a chef there's a really good cook in the kitchen—and that's meant in the nicest way. On a recent Sunday night, as the place slowly filled with couples and more than a few lone diners, it seemed as though everyone had come to tuck into the tender four-hour-braised beef (with parsnips and carrots in coriander-scented gravy, accompanied by pan-crisped spaetzle), or the mustard-crusted halibut (on a tomato-leek sauce into which those Ping-Pong-ball boiled potatoes, the kind served in your high-school cafeteria, had been dropped). Both dishes are extremely satisfying, but the trio of tiny lamb chops, which come with nothing but a sprig of rosemary and a tremendous potato pancake, is terrific. That was delicious, a man said, adding, All I had today was a turkey sandwich, as if to apologize to the waiter for not eating right.</p><p data-wc="92" word_count="92">The wine list, which includes several by the glass, is interesting and inexpensive. Like the entrées, several of the unpretentious starters have the effect of a hot toddy during a snowstorm. Rich French onion soup is fortified with wild mushrooms, and the baked goat cheese is just right if you spread it on olive-oil-drizzled toasts and pile the accompanying black-olive-and-tomato salad on top. For dessert, don't bother with anything but a dish of vanilla gelato. Then go straight home and go to bed. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $13-$24.)</p>

Rather than Nordic exotica (no reindeer, no snow scenes), the lean, sleek room imparts both culinary seriousness and jaded hotel chic. Only the high ceilings and a severe black wall pay tribute to the restaurant's location in Raymond Hood's nineteen-twenties neo-Gothic skyscraper, the American Radiator Building.</p><p data-wc="105" word_count="105">Laakkonen is fresh from Brooklyn's River Café, where he must have been challenged by the attention-grabbing view—his visual skills are sharp. Silver domes hide the dishes, and the sudden impact of his arrangements wins diners over on sight. Artichoke soup is luminous green with floating circles of summer truffles. And something about the symmetry of the grilled-quail halves with hominy makes it seem as if Laakkonen is going for a laugh. Grilled octopus, Manila clams, and saffron pastina are a dream. But the novelty act called the Tidal Pool is a high-profile washout—oysters, barnacles, and urchins, poached in an overly genteel broth.</p><p data-wc="113" word_count="113">Each entrée gets a little sidekick, a creation so smart and satisfying that it feels like an extra course thrown in. Poached black cod in a creamy finnan-haddie sauce comes with a tower of Jerusalem artichoke flan, and a rambunctiously flavored rabbit is accompanied by cannelloni stuffed with dandelion and ricotta. But Laakkonen's attention to appearance is never obnoxious—he's got a knack for the harmonious layout. A dish of giant seared scallops, with artichoke hearts, sliced morels, and coils of homemade chickpea pappardelle, is pretty enough. But once the waiter finishes it with a brick-red sauce of roasted vegetables you'd swear it was a painting by Paul Klee.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">The cheese tray shouldn't be overlooked (a highlight is the Roaring Forties sheep's-milk blue from Tasmania). It's a smartly put together selection, and just listening to the waiter's explanation is mesmerizing. Best for dessert is soup—a chilled apricot concoction with cylindrical blocks of cherry sorbet. There's also an all-citrus tasting menu—a parade of lemon bars and blood-orange granitas which seems determined to stamp out midtown scurvy. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrees $24-$38.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/09/17/artisanal	Artisanal	2 Park Ave. 	40.74635635	-73.982576422061	725-8585	2001/09/17	<p data-wc="132" word_count="132">You don't have to be a cheese geek to thrill to the sight of a hundred cheeses spread out like an exhibit of crown jewels. At Artisanal, the new Murray Hill brasserie opened by Terrance Brennan, the owner of Picholine, a giant mirror hangs over the cheese counter at the back of the restaurant. The mirror is tilted toward the dining room, so that from almost wherever you're seated you can see (and not just smell) the cheese. Some varieties look so hideous, you know they're good—for example, an English blue cheese called Blue Vinny, which is actually brown. But gathered together, they are gorgeous. There are cheeses wrapped in leaves, cheeses like skipping stones, and cheeses with such irresistible names as Gorwydd Caerphilly and Brin d'Amour.</p><p data-wc="139" word_count="139">The other day, after the lunch rush, Peter Kindel, the <em>fromager</em>, was on the phone ordering new ones. Upon learning that some rare Belgian cheeses were available, he high-fived his <em>sous-fromager</em>, then directed some assistants who were lugging massive wheels of Beaufort. Though he's a cheese connoisseur, Kindel isn't a snob: he calls stinky cheese stinky cheese. The giant wheels of Vacherin and bricks of Talleggio in his cheese cave are his beasts and his babies. That day, he had two hundred and thirty-four cheeses in stock. Among them, his favorite—his desert-island cheese—is Montgomery cheddar, which is produced by Jamie Montgomery, a cheese wizard in Somerset, whom Kindel visited for a week during a prolonged cheese-making tour of Europe, two years ago. But even before that, I was in awe of the cheese, Kindel says.</p><p data-wc="151" word_count="151">The problem with Artisanal is that it is very difficult to leave room for the cheese course. The menu is extensive, filled with brasserie standards that are, sadly, worth picking clean. Most of them have little or nothing to do with cheese: towering seafood platters, côtes de boeuf as big as Nerf footballs, steak tartare, escargot <em>pithiviers</em>, roasted cod, calves' brains. The red salads—the beet, with endive, walnuts, and goat cheese; and the watermelon, with arugula and feta—are so fresh that they momentarily allay fears that one is about to undergo death by cheese. These fears return, however, when one is confronted by a fleet of fondues (Stilton and Sauternes, Zamorano and chorizo, etc.) or by the five-page cheese list, with an extra page for notes. But there are worse ways to go. (Open Mondays through Saturdays for lunch and dinner, Sundays for dinner only. Entrées $19-$36.)</p>

After all, they had secured a table in a torridly fashionable restaurant that was packed, even on a Monday night in August. And they were sampling the food of Geoffrey Zakarian, a veteran of such high-profile playpens as the Royalton Hotel's 44 and Patroon who has come into his own in the dining room of the Chambers Hotel, a new, pocket-size dormitory catering to people who are likely to have wandered in from Norma Kamali's shop next door. Town, which was designed by the ubiquitous David Rockwell, looks like a nosh pit dreamed up by Busby Berkeley: the stairway sweeps into a glamorously backlit room with a twenty-four-foot-high ceiling, stalactites of crystal beads, and oceans of beige.</p><p data-wc="199" word_count="199">What the servers (crisply outfitted in Hugo Boss) deliver from the kitchen is a nouvelle-eclectic cuisine that makes fusion seem as dated as the atomic bomb. Starters include a sophisticated twist on the old split-pea soup (fresh peas and fried prosciutto in a chilled pea broth) and a risotto that goes where this Italian classic has never gone before (it's studded with escargots and black truffles). The main dishes include chicken roasted with rhubarb and accompanied by chanterelles and crushed parsnips; halibut poached with fennel and perked up by niçoise olives and a tomato fondue; veal tongue, cooked Basque-style, with roasted artichokes and radishes; and a pot of mussels, laced with kaffir lime and sweet garlic, which more than delivers on its aromatic promise. Town's dessert list is equally adventurous: a basket of sugary beignets spurting molten chocolate arrives, followed by a frozen <em>café brûlot</em>, spiked with rum and Grand Marnier; a grapefruit gratin gets a kick from a scoop of ginseng sorbet. Among elaborations on the traditional cheese course, the best is an aged Gouda, joined to an apple-and-maple strudel. (Open weekdays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, weekends for dinner only.

On a recent night, her customers included several svelte silver-haired couples; blond mother-and-daughter look-alikes; and two long-haired bikers, their tattooed arms displayed like gallery art, paying for their meal with a platinum card.</p><p data-wc="115" word_count="115">In spite of the dated décor (call it early <em>Metropolitan Home</em>) and retro prices (nothing tops $18), the food is decidedly fresh. Rosenzweig and her co-owner and chef, Charleen Badman, specialize in greenmarket-driven cuisine, so the focus is on seasonal ingredients—often no more than three or four to a dish—put together in a way that lets them assert their most vibrant qualities. A salad of shaved corn, chopped peaches, and almonds accompanies the salt-and-pepper-shrimp appetizer, whose fried shells Rosenzweig instructs you to eat intact, which is a great idea—sort of like vinegar-potato-chip-wrapped crustaceans. There's almost always something on the menu to dip into garlicky aioli—recently it was cakelike sweet-corn fritters.</p><p data-wc="144" word_count="144">Right now, the entrées on the changing menu are summery and light (with the exception of the steak frites, which comes with béarnaise): a pair of tempura-fried soft-shell crabs arrive on top of triangles of red watermelon and sprinkled with feta; grilled salmon is paired with cucumbers and mango. On the bar menu, the soft-shell crabs appear in what has to be the world's best club, on toasted brioche with lemon mayo and bacon. At the Lobster Club, Rosenzweig's fearlessness when it came to being a little old-fashioned was part of the charm, and the same goes here, especially when it comes to desserts. The banana split with malted-milk-ball ice cream is good, but cherry clafoutis is wonderful—if only because nobody makes it any more.

One holds pappadams, the spicy, waferlike Indian flat bread; the other holds a sweet tamarind-pulp syrup, made from the pod of the Indian evergreen. The delicious, not quite familiar combination is like the first pluck of a sitar's strings, an announcement of the delicately complex mixture of flavors, aromas, and textures that are available at this sleek, sophisticated newcomer to the Flatiron district.</p><p data-wc="228" word_count="228">Tamarind's affably imposing owner, Avtar Walia, enlisted Raji Jallepali-Reiss, the proprietor of a celebrated Indian-French fusion restaurant in Memphis, Tennessee, to create the menu, and her inventive, light-handed approach is apparent in even the most traditional Indian fare. Among the more intriguing appetizers are raj kachori, a Calcutta specialty of tamarind-flavored chickpeas served en croûte, and Rajasthani sooley, skewered grilled strips of lamb, marinated in lemon and garlic and served perfectly rare. A she-crab soup, enlivened with an infusion of sweet spices, ginger juice, and saffron, suggests a Mardi Gras in Madras. Especially good among the main dishes are a whole, crisp-roasted small leg of lamb marinated in mint-ginger chutney, and a roasted Cornish game hen with tamarind-and-garlic soup. The standout among the seafood dishes is a fisherman's stew of mussels, clams, and shrimp in a tomato consommé, whose subtlety makes its Mediterranean counterparts seem lumpen. All the classic Indian vegetarian and rice dishes are available, including an exemplary Punjabi dal of black lentils, and, in that usual wasteland in Indian menus—the desserts—Tamarind has come up with a number of gentle palate soothers. The restaurant's version of rasmalai, cottage-cheese dumplings flavored with cardamom and rose water, has to be the most delectable blending of two courses—the cheese and the sweet—in town.

What next—Blue Ribbon Larchmont?</p><p data-wc="108" word_count="108">Now seems like a good time to reëxamine the success of the Bromberg brothers, Bruce and Eric, who grew up in New Jersey and studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. More than eight years after the original Blue Ribbon's opening, just about everybody knows it as the spot that chefs head for after closing down their own kitchens (it's open until 4 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span>). Once there, they squeeze into the small front room for a snack from the raw bar, or join the line (no reservations for fewer than five) to be escorted into the slightly larger dining area, packed with a sexy late-night crowd.</p><p data-wc="58" word_count="58">But the best time to judge the place by its food is in the early evening, when the sun is still shining through the large front window, the noise level is still pleasant (turns out they play terrific music), and the waiters are hanging around the kitchen door in the back, just waiting for someone to wait on.</p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">Blue Ribbon is an Americanized version of the serious bistros the Brombergs modelled it on. Expertly made dishes are served in the studied dowdy elegance of a single room that's been painted cream and maroon, with perpetually dusty-looking floors, paper-topped tables so small that everyone bumps knees, and menus too big by half. The menu has to be big to hold the eighty-plus eclectic favorites. And yet it's neither overwhelming nor diffuse. None of the items are loaded down with windbag descriptions of ingredients or preparation details. It's inviting, straightforward food that speaks for itself: shrimp cocktail, fried oysters, beef marrow, garlicky snails, or steak tartare to start, followed by hangar steak with onion rings, fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collards, sautéed skate with potatoes and bacon, a duck club sandwich, or rack of lamb—not to mention fresh oysters, clams, crab legs, crawfish, and other raw-bar delicacies. (Skip the gloppy cheese fondue.) For dessert, you can have a piece of ridiculously good chocolate cake or a banana split.</p><p data-wc="32" word_count="32">The answer to the Bromberg brothers' success? They cook food that you like, not just food that they want you to like. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner only. Entrées $10-$30.)</p>

But next to an underground parking garage, past an Astro-Turfed patio, is an unlikely refuge—a taste of Provence (with a dash of New Hope, Pennsylvania).</p><p data-wc="177" word_count="177">The chef, Antoine Bouterin, who left Le Périgord six years ago, has said that his restaurant was inspired by his grandmother Marguerite, a well-known Provençal restaurateur, but the sort of person the place really brings to mind is a batty great-aunt. Past the entranceway, overflowing with the scent of hothouse flowers and candle wax, the space is cluttered with French antiques and flea-market finds: doll houses, cuckoo clocks, Bundt-cake molds, garden trolls, golden putti, medicine bottles, country scenes, and old framed barkeep taunts (“If you’re so damn smart, why ain’t you rich?”). Looking around the dimly lit, ochre-walled dining room while trying to make up your mind about which wine to choose from the terrific list, you might find a bust of Ben Franklin or a stuffed Frosty the Snowman doll. What these two gentlemen have to do with Provence perhaps only Peter Mayle could say, but there they are. It’s kitsch in the grand Upper East Side tradition, an over-the-top antidote to all those slick minimalist establishments that photograph so well.</p><p data-wc="137" word_count="137">The menu steers you gently toward Bouterin’s best and most traditional dishes: his sturdy homemade pâté, with cornichons and a celery-root remoulade; the crispy onion tart with anchovies; or the “very tasty and silky fish soup like Marseille fisherman.” For the main course, Bouterin makes a mean bouillabaisse, with whatever fruits the sea has made available that day, and a lamb stew (<em>“l’agneau de sept heures façon baroque”</em>) that’s so thoroughly stewed the chef encourages diners to eat it with a spoon. The desserts are lovely, especially the <em>île flottante</em>, an island of custard floating in a pool of vanilla sauce, strewn with berries—”my aunt Marie’s way.” Order that, and the waiter says “Yeah!” as though you’ve just passed a pop quiz. (Open daily for dinner. Entrées $20-$29.)</p>

They marvelled at the plainness of the dining room, with its whitewashed walls and exposed beams, and then headed past the kitchen into a pretty covered garden decorated with an Aegean mural and a motley assortment of potted plants. Older diners who can remember the time when an authentic Greek taverna looked like an authentic Greek taverna will feel as if they were back in some waterfront spot in Piraeus, expecting Melina Mercouri to come swivelling down the pier.</p><p data-wc="185" word_count="185">The restaurant takes its name from the island that Odysseus spent so many years trying to get home to, and there’s probably nothing on the menu that would have surprised him when he got there. Among the classic Greek starters are a fish soup, crowded with shrimp, mussels, and snapper; tongue-curling spreads of <em>taramosalata, <em>tsatziki</em>, and <em>melitzanosalata</em>; quick-charred octopus; slithery, chewy stuffed grape leaves; and fried cheese. The best meat dishes, all of which are straightforward, are the baby lamb, in a clay pot with orzo, and the rabbit stew, in a rich wine-and-tomato sauce. But the real draw is the whole fish—a choice of wonderfully fresh snapper, striped bass, porgy, or red mullet, which a happily gruff waiter brings to the table untouched, and then returns, minutes later, with the creature perfectly broiled, boned, and dressed in the mother of all sauces: a squeeze of lemon and a splash of olive oil. After that, the homemade yogurt, with honey and walnuts, has to be the safest port in town. (Open weekdays for dinner only, weekends for lunch and dinner. Entrées $17-$24)</em></p>

Not much grows at Himalayan altitudes, so ingredients are limited (barley stands in for wheat; garlic, ginger, and chili peppers flavor most everything). And Buddhist teachings are also at work (for purposes of spirit economy, it’s better to kill one really big animal than many little ones).</p><p data-wc="154" word_count="154">The first thing the waitress brings to the table is cups of <em>bocha</em>, a salty, buttered black tea. It quickly splits tables of neophytes for and against—thinking of it as soup helps. It’s the <em>tsel thang</em>, a plain broth with spinach, however, that really sets the tone for everything to come—strong, simple flavors. Yak is too expensive to import, so there’s a lot of beef on the menu. Like all the meat dishes, the chunks of marinated beef tongue are subtle, not smothered in an overpowering sauce. Even the Indian-influenced lamb curry—with lots of star anise—and a terrific pork chili only flirt with fire. But robust vegetarian entrées get top billing. <em>Tsel thinthuk</em> is a big bowl of broth with spinach, radish, and scraggly handmade pasta which could put chicken soup out of business. Potatoes with spinach are slightly undercooked, so their flavor is strong and pure.</p><p data-wc="107" word_count="107">A couple of the dishes may seem plain strange to some diners. The <em>la phing</em> salad, for example, a disk of cold bean jelly, absurdly spicy, comes across as a prank. And the desserts seem to have been improvised in a hurry by someone who’d never heard of dessert. (Turns out they really are ancient Tibetan treats.) Short tubes of pasta rolled in sugar, barley, and grated cheese seem to have been invented to serve to Italian explorers. The other dessert seems to have been designed for an infant—plain yogurt, rice, golden raisins, and butter—and, indeed, a recent toddler diner found it quite enticing.</p><p data-wc="66" word_count="66">Along with a well-groomed, nonplussed-looking yak, the eight auspicious symbols of Tibetan Buddhism are painted on the walls, and the place seems to need the good luck. It serves a smattering of Tibetan and Nepali families and a slowly growing cult following, but the delicious, rough-hewn food has somehow been overlooked by the city’s culinary adventurers.

We started out with medium-hot, the manager, Hernan, says, but diners complained about the level of spiciness. What we now serve is the lower range. But make no mistake: even though it's labelled <em>nuevo peruano</em> on the menu, this is authentic Peruvian cuisine, which relies on the potent chili known as <em>ají amarillo</em>.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">The homey yet nouvelle-pretty dishes incorporate such typical ingredients as avocado, white and sweet potato, egg, plantain, yuca, rice, and tomato—but often in unexpectedly rich combinations. The shrimp cocktail, for instance, has diced shrimp, potato, hard-cooked egg, and avocado coated in a thick <em>amarillo</em> sauce and served in a nest of fried potato straws. (Of course, there's also a bracing selection of mixed seviches, with assorted <em>mojos</em>—garlicky vinaigrettes). <em>Ají</em>-citrus-and-cilantro-spiked meat and seafood dishes dominate the menu: marinated braised pork on mashed chickpeas, poached corbina (similar to Chilean sea bass) with Peruvian mayonnaise and asparagus, and the Peruvian version of paella—tomato-rich rice and seafood topped with string beans and pickled red onions.</p><p data-wc="124" word_count="124">First and foremost, however, Sipan is the place to be if you love swordfish, an item that has lately been missing from menus around the city. Six big juicy chunks arrive on skewers, char-striped and smoky-tasting from the grill. They're accompanied by slices of sweet potato and a small pot of spicy <em>huancaina</em> sauce (olive oil blended with garlic, bread crumbs, and a little cheese), but all they really need is a squeeze of lemon, and maybe a glass of Peruvian beer to go with them. When you're finished, Hernan may insist that you try the house-special dessert—a perfect rice pudding with a side of macerated dried fruit. (Open weekdays for dinner only, weekends for brunch and dinner. Entrées $14-$19.)</p>

At the moment, there is no grander restaurant in town than Daniel Boulud's citadel of luxe, and yet, from the moment you walk in, you're made to feel nothing but warmth. There are greeters galore in the handsome, inviting foyer, but their murmuring good manners conceal nothing but a very pleasant welcome. There is no sense that you're being asked to cool your heels when one of them suggests that you wait a moment in the harlequin-colored bar area, with its Starckian velvet perches and beautifully presented cocktails. And when you are led into the extravagant dining room—a lobby-turned-seraglio with rosy lighting, great swags of striped silk, and a wall of flowers that would make Jeff Koons swoon—you may feel like settling in for the night. Daniel's considerable achievement is to have made Old World swank seem fresh and intimate.</p><p data-wc="222" word_count="222">A similar paradox defines the food: luxurious, sometimes surprising combinations, which, when all is said and done, seem simple. Right now the kitchen is besotted by spring, and it's turning out such exquisite bouquets as cold carrot soup with shrimp, sharpened by lime, cumin, and a light coriander cream; and nine-herb ravioli with spring peas, morel cream, and toasted shallots. Main courses dig deeper into the seasonal bounty: a paupiette of sea bass wrapped in a crunchy potato shell and served with leeks and a gutsy Syrah sauce; a risotto of asparagus and lobster, finished with creamy chanterelles; a monumental homage to spring lamb, the rack crusted with olive, lemon, tomato, and pine nuts, the shoulder stuffed with Swiss chard, alongside eggplant, fava beans, and polenta scented with rosemary and scallions. The dessert selection offers variations on two themes: fruit of every variety combined in soups, sorbets, cakes, or tatins; and chocolate, which attains dangerous heights in a mille-feuille with black-peppermint semi-freddo and champagne gelée. But even when M. Boulud's food reaches for never-never land, it remains firmly grounded. He is, after all, not from Paris but from Lyons, the ancient heart of French gastronomy, where deep comfort takes precedence over passing chic.

This brand-new restaurant (pronounced West, a sign in the ouindow says helpfully) seems endearingly oblivious to the neighborhood's longstanding indifference to stylish dining. Two days after its opening, the chef, Tom Valenti, sat at the small bar staring intently at one of the crimson-and-gold-striped silk lanterns that hang from the ceiling like rep ties. Later, he stopped in front of a row of sexy red-leather banquettes, lined above by six-foot mahogany-framed mirrors, and scrutinized the lantern again. Is it crooked? he asked. It looked great. The whole place did, including the big boutonnière of cherry blossoms, lilacs, and hydrangeas which stood sentinel at the door.</p><p data-wc="52" word_count="52">Does the Upper West Side deserve such sophistication? There's really no kind way to tell a neighborhood that a restaurant is too good for it, but some practical advice is in order: dress <em>up</em> a little, for God's sake, and leave the kids at home—along with that the-world-is-my-living-room attitude!</p><p data-wc="146" word_count="146">Ouest clearly has more than good looks going for it. Valenti has been with a number of terrific restaurants, notably Alison on Dominick, so he's used to adulation for his robust yet lovely way with classic food. Nothing is overly fancy here—short ribs with polenta, skate with cabbage, rabbit with spring vegetables—but it's just fancy enough. To start, Valenti piles thin slices of creamy gravlax on a rustic chickpea pancake with caviar and mustard oil, or pan-singes a terrine of potatoes, truffles, and goat cheese and serves it with a dice of sweet marinated beets and bitter dandelion greens. His simple roast chicken is just right (it comes with mashed potatoes, shiitake mushrooms, and soft cloves of roasted garlic), but his best entrée may be the roasted salmon, which is crispy on the outside and smoky flavored, in a caviar-spiked remoulade.</p><p data-wc="98" word_count="98">Desserts are at once plain and decadent: a dense, cupcake-size chocolate cake with homemade banana ice cream and a few dots of cocoa sauce, a salty-sweet rhubarb crisp with the most intensely flavored buttermilk ice cream imaginable, passion-fruit panna cotta. The menu also caters to people who don't like their peas to touch their potatoes, or their steak piled on their starch, with a selection of simple grills—chops, steaks, chicken—which you can complement with such sides as braised savoy cabbage, soft polenta, or creamed spinach. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for dinner only. Entrées $15-$28.)</p>

Until that day arrives, you can make do at this Amagansett-based eatery. The proprietor, Gary MacGurn, lived for five years on an ashram in India, where he mastered the art of making the slightly chewy, addictive sourdough crêpes called <em>dosai</em>. Since this is SoHo, MacGurn's version comes with an inventive array of light yet savory fillings that elevate the humble Indian breakfast staple into a perfect quick lunch or dinner after a day of loading up on post-postmodern art or ridiculously expensive shoes.</p><p data-wc="103" word_count="103">MacGurn has said that his kitchen resembles an ashram. And so it does. It's airy and open and spotless, and candles burn all day long. The cooks seem almost somnambulant as they ladle circles of fermented rice batter onto hot griddles, sprinkle them with combinations of vegetables, fish, chicken, and cheese, and fold them over loosely like giant, handmade envelopes; they're so in synch with the process that even when a lunch crush wreaks chaos in the dining room it takes only about four minutes to get your <em>dosai</em>, which are served practically hanging over the edges of wax-paper-lined cafeteria trays.</p><p data-wc="73" word_count="73">This cuisine draws some of the same trend-mongering adherents that modern yoga does, which means that the line to order is clogged with an international crowd of cell-phone-blabbing Prada-wearers. Though the walls are lined with portraits of Swami Chidvalasanda, during the lunch rush there's not a lot of Ashtanga posturing going on; instead it's pushing (Will you be leaving this table soon?) and posing (Are you going to produce or direct?).</p><p data-wc="114" word_count="114">But never mind. Once the food arrives, everyone meditates on the incomparable experience of <em>dosai</em>. The crunchy, tangy wrapper perfectly complements MacGurn's fourteen fillings: the No. 6, classic <em>masala</em> (spiced potatoes) with spinach, Jack cheese, and tomato, is the best. But everything else—tuna, avocado, and arugula; Kalamata olive, roasted tomato, onion, arugula, and goat cheese; smoked turkey, spinach, Jack cheese, and balsamic-roasted onion—is satisfying in a way that no burrito or wrap sandwich ever could be. If you can't find a place to sit down, <em>dosai</em> are easy to eat on the street. Soup and grilled nan are also available.

Antitheft gates give way to an abandoned-looking barroom, where the owner, Vincenzo Cerbone, rises from his desk to steer you to the main dining room full of brass and brick and dusty, empty bottles of Amarone; if he remembers your face he’ll treat you like family.</p><p data-wc="116" word_count="116">It’s a family kind of place. Vincenzo’s wife of forty years, Ida, is in the kitchen every day, and his son Anthony works the floor. Anthony speaks wise and staccato and never forgets a name or a regular’s favorite Chianti. “O.K., you’re in,” he snaps after taking an order. “I’m going down to the cellar—can I get you anything?” There’s a lengthy, inscrutable wine list, but none of Anthony’s on-the-mark, reasonably priced recommendations ever seem to be on it. “Go easy on that Dolcetto, boys,” he warns one table. “It says it’s only thirteen per cent alcohol, but that’s just to get it through customs.”</p><p data-wc="160" word_count="160">Portions are huge, and no one notices. (It has to be said: there are some really big people here.) The cold seafood platter is a clean and crisp spread of lightly marinated mussels, calamari, scungilli, and shrimp. Baked clams are a rare achievement: they actually taste like clams. And the mozzarella is so fresh it’s barely set. There’s a punchy penne puttanesca and really good ricotta gnocchi, but the glowing-orange fettuccine Bolognese seems to be the most popular dish in the joint. The pork and veal can be tough and bland, but a frequent special involves giant, succulent blocks of roast pig with skin. Anthony will decide if you need a side. “How about I bring an order of cauliflower for the table,” he says, with no interrogative inflection. For dessert, the comically huge wedge of ricotta cheesecake is as luxuriously creamy and liquor-soaked as any of the other five or six desserts, which include tiramisu and cannoli.</p><p data-wc="58" word_count="58">Most customers leave Vincenzo with a very precise “See you next week,” but on a recent night an imposing, bullet-headed gentleman started an argument about his bill: nobody would let him have it. Apparently he’s such a regular his money is no good here. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for dinner only. Entrées $8-$24.)</p>

On a recent night at Atlas, a snug, wood-panelled establishment that has all the charm of a first-class-passenger lounge, the starter was a thimbleful of what can only be described as essence of sea foam. An initial sip was inviting enough: the frothy brine was warmed and sweetened by cream and . . . was it vanilla? But then something solid struck the palate, introducing a wholly unexpected element—a chunk of what tasted like smoked eel. The fire down below, I guess, one diner quipped, trying to decide whether he had enjoyed what he had just inadvertently swallowed. The remark probably would have delighted the much discussed chef Paul Liebrandt, whose concoctions seem designed less to feed the soul than to stimulate conversation.</p><p data-wc="174" word_count="174">Consider the first courses: poached oysters in apple cider with foie gras, cornichon purée, and almond froth; mackerel tartare with black-olive jelly and smoked-bacon sorbet. Among the main courses are squab with cauliflower, mango, and bitter chocolate; yellowtail with cannelloni of bacon and rhubarb in a tarragon sauce; and cod larded with eel in a coconut-curry sauce. In fact, most of Liebrandt's food is more titillating to the imagination than to the tongue: he combines his seemingly dissonant flavors with such subtlety that the results are surprisingly bland. (The most memorable thing about his use of bitter chocolate is the way he drizzles it across the china, Morris Louis-style.) There is a splendid selection of cheeses (including a great Cropwell Bishop Stilton) and an eye-catching assortment of desserts in which the relentless whimsy finally becomes genuinely satisfying—notably, a chilled rhubarb soup with goat's-milk-yogurt sorbet, white chocolate, and pistachios and a milk-chocolate panna cotta in a tamarind sauce, sprinkled with fleur de sel.

Instead, the place is modestly decorated with quiet black-and-white photos of southern Louisiana—a swampy back yard with willow trees, some guys in a fishing boat, the blur of a perturbed-looking crocodile—and it sits just above the brightly lit Slice of Harlem II pizza parlor. Outside you can buy socks from folding tables.</p><p data-wc="63" word_count="63">What exactly qualifies as Creole? Explanations inevitably involve a convoluted history lesson, a litany of spices and ethnic groups, and a passing mention of tomatoes. But Steven Manning (most recently of Clancy's in New Orleans) has been turning out this kind of food for more than a decade, so rather than worrying about its origins, patrons just enjoy the delicious shrimp gumbo.</p><p data-wc="74" word_count="74">Or the turtle soup—flecks of Louisiana snapping-turtle meat in a dark-brown roux flavored with sherry, lemon, clove, bay leaf, and garlic. It's a pungent, wild ride, especially after an appetizer of Manning's sautéed chicken livers with port-wine glaze and sesame seeds. The chef's invention of cornmeal-fried oysters served on sautéed spinach and smothered in melted Brie only faintly resembles oysters in the end, but it's delicious nonetheless.</p><p data-wc="79" word_count="79">The requisite shrimp Creole and crawfish étouffée both make impressive appearances, and for those who equate Southern with fried there's thin-sliced, farm-raised catfish, marinated and deep fried in cornmeal and served with hush puppies <em>and</em> French fries. The sautéed Snapper Alexandria, with roasted pecans and vanilla-lemon butter, is terrific but could be upstaged by the special on any given day—especially the sautéed sea scallops or the crispy-skin sea bass with snow peas and grits.</p><p data-wc="82" word_count="82">The Bayou Bread Pudding with bourbon sauce would seem to be the appropriate choice for dessert here, but a slice of frozen lemon pie (have a shot of Jack Daniel's if you miss the bourbon) is better, and so is the pecan brownie, served with homemade peppermint ice cream and chocolate Creole sauce. What makes the chocolate sauce Creole? Who cares? It's luscious. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner; Saturdays for dinner only; Sundays for brunch only. Entrées $13-$22.)</p>

Maybe there was some confusion involving the insidious Olive Garden chain, or maybe expectations just weren't that high for Mediterranean food from Beantown.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">As it turns out, English's worst enemy is not gastronomic snobbery but his own interior decorator, David Rockwell, who seems to have ordered the patchwork-quilt-themed décor from an out-of-date Pottery Barn catalogue. Overwrought candelabras and droopy blown-glass pod lights make for a strictly suburban fantasy of fanciness. And the place might as well be out of town—its location in the W hotel, a block north of Union Square, draws L.A. suntans at lunch and heavily made-up Europeans at dinner.</p><p data-wc="136" word_count="136">The food, however, is another story. English's mix-and-match Mediterranean flavor scheme is so balanced that he's free to hit every note as hard as he wants. A Spartan squid-and-octopus dish comes loaded with garlic and parsley and has enough of a smoky charring to explain the shrinelike presence of the rotisserie, which is spotlighted behind glass. English knows that no lightweight ever ordered raw hamburger, so he turns his <em>carne cruda</em> into a roundhouse punch with richly truffled beef and a quail-egg yolk. One rustic appetizer— the signature tart of olives, goat cheese, caramelized onions, and anchovies—is such perfect picnic food that it feels absurd to be eating it indoors. Another, the lobster falafel, isn't going to put Moshe's Forty-sixth Street cart out of business, but the experiment is perversely exciting.</p><p data-wc="52" word_count="52">The entrées include an osso bucco that contains a daunting amount of marrow, and braised-rabbit lasagna, which comes in a high-test white-wine reduction (it's siesta-inducing at lunch). Even the vegetables that accompany the Chilean sea bass are roasted with a powerful country ham that threatens to take over the plate.</p><p data-wc="76" word_count="76">All this bravado is exhilarating—it's good to know that your chef has no fear of flavor—but it can wear out the most dogged diner. (Just reading the menu is exhausting—ingredients get spun, shaved, showered, whipped, wrapped, and shucked.) By the time dessert rolls around, many are likely to feel sated—and too spent to contemplate the peppermint bombe or the oven-roasted pineapple. (Open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Entrées $23-$30.)</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/03/19/mexicana-mama	Mexicana Mama	525 Hudson St. 	42.3561888	-83.0837728	924-4119	2001/03/19	<p data-wc="196" word_count="196">At first glance, this ridiculously cramped cantina in the West Village doesn't promise much. The menu is an unsurprising list of tacos, enchiladas, etc. The décor—periwinkle walls adorned by a huge poster of a Latin babe, a trio of life-size Chihuahua-shaped candles, a sad-looking Virgin Mary clock, holstered squirt guns—is not exactly three-star calibre. But it quickly becomes apparent that Mexicana Mama is something special. There's no bar in sight, but a perfect margarita appears on command the minute you sit down. The chatty-blasé waiters use such terms as on a mirror to mean in a sauce—pretentious and incomprehensible, but also attention-grabbing in a place like this. And bobbing around in the open kitchen's crowd is  a tall, white toque, which sits atop the tiny chef  Julieta Ballesteros, who should be taken as seriously as her hat implies. You have beautiful rice, a handsome customer recently told her, and the rice  is in fact not only lovely to behold but also to taste (it's cooked just right, in two entrée-enhancing versions: tossed with cumin, carrots, and peas, or topped with corn and flavored with cilantro and poblanos).</p><p data-wc="237" word_count="237">Ballesteros pays equal attention to all her homey yet elegant dishes. The Mexicana salad (greens with avocado, jicama, mango, and a spicy chipotle dressing) is just as good a reason to eat here as the  main courses, and so is the rustic black-bean soup, the whole-bean kind, with big chunks of onion and tomato and a handful of fresh cilantro. Pork tacos are made with fine corn tortillas, filled with smoky-sweet chile-roasted meat and lightly grilled. The relleno, a split poblano that's roasted, not fried, is filled with corn shaved fresh from the cob, plenty of tomato, and just enough savory Chihuahua cheese. But the most interesting entrées are the chalkboard specials, which always include a meat dish (for instance, a thick, slow-cooked pork chop that falls from the bone), a dry-looking but juicy chicken course, and a seafood dish, served on a mirror of one of the chef's delicious mole, chile-pepper, or fresh-fruit-and-avocado sauces (a recent favorite: fat triangles of rare tuna on thinly sliced mango  and avocado, drizzled with a <em>guajillo</em>-chile salsa and topped with almond-and-pistachio paste). For dessert, expect inventive specials along with the usual suspects (flan, seasonal fruit), and while you're eating expect to be accidentally bonked on the head at least once by a backpack attached to someone waiting for a table. It's crowded in here. (Open Tuesdays through Sundays for lunch and dinner. Entrées $8-$15.)  </p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/03/05/grand-central-degustation	Grand Central Degustation	null	null	null	null	2001/03/05	<p data-wc="63" word_count="63">One of the better ideas in the renovation of Grand Central Terminal was to turn the lower level into a street fair featuring vest-pocket versions of some of the city's most popular eateries. Noshing one's way from counter to counter is another New York experience: there's something for everyone, some of it very good, some of it not so good.</p><p data-wc="62" word_count="62">Cheap, fast Indian food, usually a bland mélange of curry and mystery meat, seems to have a different DNA at <strong>Café Spice</strong> (227-1300). The entrées have distinct flavors (fenugreek, Goan spices) and just enough heat to make a real impression. A good lunch choice is the Roomali Roll ($7-9), delicious bits of chicken or lamb wrapped in crisp whole-wheat bread.</p><p data-wc="83" word_count="83">On weekdays, over at <strong>Caviarteria</strong> (682-5355), forlorn-looking servers flip through the <em>Post</em> with little to do, perhaps because the centrally located bar is a bit too conspicuous a spot for caviar consumption. But things liven up on Fridays, when the high-end fish eggs are available until 7 <span class="smallcaps">P.M.</span>, and a smattering of flush patrons stop off to fork over $28 for an eighth of an ounce each of beluga, ossetra, or sevruga, and a glass of Taittinger champagne, or an ounce of American sturgeon ($20).</p><p data-wc="53" word_count="53">Microbrew Pilsner on Tap is advertised on the overhead menu at <strong>Christer's</strong> (986-1230), but the only tap beer turns out to be Bud Light, and that about says it all. This is a good-and-greasy fish-and-chips place; attempts to fancify things with grilled salmon and Asian slaw are rightfully ignored by most patrons.</p><p data-wc="56" word_count="56">If the Allies had landed on <strong>Custard Beach</strong> (983-9155), they might not have bothered fighting the rest of the war. Instead, they would have laid down their arms, taken out their mess kits, and busied themselves with spoons. Most of the flavors here are good, but the standbys (chocolate and vanilla, in particular) are the standouts.</p><p data-wc="47" word_count="47">The old-Brooklyn atmosphere is missing from the compact outpost of <strong>Junior's</strong> (983-5257), but the deli chow has survived the conversion. Pickled starters (cabbage, beets, etc.) come in a paper container, and the burgers are pretty dry, but the cheesecake and the Reuben sandwich are still peerless.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">At <strong>Knödel</strong> (986-1230), Cajun-hot andouille sausage—which ranges from moist to sawdust-dry depending on the time of day—is the tastiest item in a modestly global assortment of weenies. At the littlest version of Forty-third Street's <strong>Little Pie Company</strong> (983-3538), big pies are available to take back to the family. Mini-pies, however (eight-bite affairs that include Mississippi mud, Key lime, and pear-apple crumb), are the obvious post-lunch picks. They're not baked on-site, but those who demand their pie hot can have it nuked.  It's the side dishes that excel at <strong>Masa's</strong> (972-3688). Miso soup ($4), loaded with mushrooms, tofu, and seaweed, makes a satisfying, quick meal. And a dish of cold, salty edamame ($3) is like a tasty health-food tonic. While none of the sushi rolls are shabby, it's probably best to stick with the fresh-tasting salmon rolls.</p><p data-wc="39" word_count="39"><strong>Mendy's Kosher Delicatessen</strong> (856-9399) provides pastrami for the ride to Rye, but it's no Katz's. Still, they've got their Orthodox credentials right up front: decent half-sours on the side, and a selection of portable knishes ($3).</p><p data-wc="77" word_count="77">Mike Bergen, the former street-cart vender and owner of <strong>Mike's Take-Away</strong>, stands out among his clerks in paper hats and tees the same way his food stands out in Grand Central. This is not your typical lunch counter. Dried peaches add a gentle sweetness to his spicy Algerian tomato soup, and turnips complete the split pea nicely. The menu, which changes daily, includes sandwiches and such hearty microwavable entrées as lasagna and shepherd's pie.</p><p data-wc="61" word_count="61">The usual Vietnamese fare is served at <strong>NEM</strong> (338-6810), but the thing to have here is a sandwich ($6-7). Really. A ciabatta roll with chewy crust is spread with pâté on one side, butter on the other, and filled with grilled pork, sirloin, shrimp, or chicken; scattered with cilantro, carrot, cucumber, and daikon; and dressed with the traditional sweet-and-sour marinade.</p><p data-wc="23" word_count="23">The doughy, lukewarm twists at <strong>Pretzel Bakery</strong> make a decent cushion for a vodka Martini in the bar car on the way home.</p><p data-wc="56" word_count="56">Soul food isn't about restraint, and the <strong>Shoebox Café</strong> (986-5959) spares no expense (or calorie) in creating its fried chicken ($8), macaroni and cheese ($6), and other Southern specialties. The real finds are the lighter fare: one of the sandwiches, which include a superb spinach-and-egg wrap, may serve you better at lunchtime than a mound of ribs.</p><p data-wc="72" word_count="72">Outside <strong>Two Boots</strong> (557-7992), an impatient line awaits andouille-and-crawfish topped pizza slices at the takeaway counter. Inside, blues and soul drift from the jukebox as diners wrestle with po'boys and the cornmeal-crusted pies that have been a staple of this chain since its birth in the East Village, in 1987. It's all good, as they say, especially when it's washed down with a cold Abita, the hard-to-get Crescent City brew.</p><p data-wc="53" word_count="53">Whoever's minding the Mexican range at <strong>Zócalo</strong> (687-5666) seems to be taking a siesta. The soups are watery, the taco fillings are gruel-like, and the salads are limp. But the three-graded list of tequilas is remarkably comprehensive, and a shot or two is the perfect tranquillizer for beating the rush-hour blues.</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/02/19/fleur-de-sel	Fleur de Sel	5 E. 20th St. 	42.3238915	-83.0800609	460-9100	2001/02/19	<p data-wc="112" word_count="112">Cyril Renaud, the chef-owner of this plain-looking four-month-old café in the Flatiron district, won't be insulted if you heap salt on his food. In fact, he wants you to: at each table he's placed little wooden shovels in bowls of the artisanal sea salt <em>fleur de sel</em>, which is harvested near his home town, in Brittany. The flower of salt is swept from the evaporating surfaces of briny marshes on hot, breezy days, which captures oceanic flavor without the heavy dose of saline; the seasoning develops the flavors of the food, and it's even good eaten straight. It could be the New York restaurant world's new white truffle.</p><p data-wc="142" word_count="142">Fleur de Sel is one of a new breed of intimate spots around town where pedigreed chefs turn their backs on spectacle and crowds to stay behind the stoves. Renaud's prix-fixe menu is challenging but never showy; his combinations transform simple flavors into something luxurious. Parsnip soup with chestnut ravioli is well rounded, with a little kick from white-truffle oil. Rose water keeps a dried-fruit purée from becoming too sweet as a bath for the seared-foie-gras appetizer. Astoundingly tender whole beef cheeks in a Pinot Noir sauce (it turns out they're marinated in the hot wine for three days) are bolstered by rustic kamut, an Egyptian grain. Pigeon (raised upstate, it's announced, lest diners confuse the fowl with its city cousin) is served in salmis sauce, a pungent concoction made from the bird's heart, liver, and brain.</p><p data-wc="70" word_count="70">The exposed-brick room relies entirely on a suite of Renaud's own modest oil paintings, chunkily rendered flowers, bottles, and village scenes with Post-Impressionist looks and Ludwig Bemelmans charm. (Renaud taught himself to paint a year ago, after he left his position as executive chef at La Caravelle.) From across the room they add color to a pleasantly forgettable ambience—the food is the only thing meant to attract attention.</p><p data-wc="97" word_count="97">For dessert, there's a flashy white-chocolate-and-caramel ganache with a regiment of fine raspberries, but the apple crêpe, a Breton classic Renaud makes the hard way (caramelizing it and flipping it three times) is clearly closer to his heart. He probably had an army cooking the desserts at his last post, but at a recent lunch he delivered a late crêpe himself, explaining that he'd burned the first one a bit and had decided to start all over. (Open weekdays for lunch and dinner, weekends for dinner only. Prix fixe, $30 for lunch, $52 for dinner.)</p><p data-wc="2" word_count="2"><author>Owen Phillips</author></p>

She is a singer, pianist, arranger, and songwriter who teaches at the Manhattan School of Music and appears several nights a week by herself in Peacock Alley at the Waldorf, and Eddie Monteiro is a virtuoso accordianist and singer who pieces out a living by playing weddings and private parties. Mentions their exceptional new CD, "A Perfect Match,O on the Denon label. They first met in the mid-seventies, but began working together only 6 years ago. "I grew up in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, a mile or two south of the George Washington Bridge. My father is Italian and my mother Czech. My father, Nick Marano, was a classically trained pianist, but he could play anything. When he was 19, Vincent Lopez hired him for his band at the Taft Hotel. He was on staff at WINS when radio stations had live music, and he did jingles and Broadway rehearsals, and even opera rehearsals, and he did club dates. For a long time, he was the pianist at the Paris in the Sky restaurant in the Hotel Suburban in East Orange. It was owned by Dorothy Kilgallen and Dick Kollmar, and that job put my sister and me through the Manhattan School of Music. But the best thing about my father was that he made you want to please him. He insisted that my sister and I start off classically and when we were ten and eleven he brought in a teacher from Juilliard, a man named Yehuda Guttman, to teach all of us, himself included, which for him meant brushing up on his Chopin.</p>
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/12/21/child-of-cabaret	CHILD OF CABARET	null	null	null	null	1992/12/21	<p>TABLES FOR TWO about singer and actress Andrea Marcovicci, or simply Marcovicci, as she has come to be known, in the noble, surnames-only tradition of Paif and Dietrich and Garbo. She is back in the Oak Room of the Algonquin, in the middle of a four-month stand. She started out in the sixties, as a folksinger. She wore a lot of fringe and headbands and sang "awful songs" that she wrote. She idolized Joni Hitchell and Joan Baez and Judy Collins, and especially Peter, Paul &amp; Mary. When she wasn't singing she was acting. She did Ophelia in Central Park with San Waterson, the film "The Front with Woody Allen and Zero Mostel and "Ambassador" on Broadway, which lasted just five days. Then she quit singing and moved to the West Coast. In 1985, she decided that she wanted to sing the songs of her parent's generation--the Kerns and Porters and Gershwins. She associated those songs with her mother, who, under the name of Helen Stuart, had been a singer in New York in the forties. She cements her show with talk. She gives the provenance of each song, describes the period in which it was written, and when she is doing her Jerome Kern show interlards her comments with his biography. She also talks about herself and about her father and mother. All this forms a cradle for her singing. She has a folksinger's voice. her vibrato is pronounced and she tends to ride over or under some of her notes. It is a sweet Baez voice--but when she wants, she can rattle the rafters. "I never saw Mabel Mercer in person, but I feel close to her. I even wear a black velvet with white birds embroidered on it that resembles a dress she had. People have beenkind enough to compare me to her. I think of Mabel as my future."</p>
